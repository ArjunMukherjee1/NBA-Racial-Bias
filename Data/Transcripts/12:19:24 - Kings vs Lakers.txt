 JJ reck the head coach for the Lakers in his first season on the sidelines say that his team has gotten a little bit of rest and had a chance to build up and work on their defense in recent days let's take a look at what they run here on the game's first possession Reaves on the handoff from Davis knocks down the three and Austin Reaves obviously a player that is so critical to the overall success of this Lakers team shooting a pretty decent clip this season from Beyond The Arc someone they got to make uncomfortable early Davis on the turnover back to Reaves over to Christie good defense by Fox got his chest on Christie but a little overzealous committing the foul there NBA player minutes wise in league history I thought that Mike Brown said something that was really maybe the best explanation for what it's like to coach LeBron James in terms of minutes played and he said it's really difficult as a coach to not have out there on the floor and he said I'm pretty sure he played you know 47 and minutes a game for me that have been Cleveland as a youngster and if you look at the was a masterful job by James and brown good block Inside by Davis and here comes James back the other way Stars down Murray sprays it out to Christie for three and with the rebound really in the game for JJ reic Mark as a a top guard Defender so we'll see how he handles the Kings who getting off to a slow start off defense trying to key in on that so far doing it well Mike Brown said that his team would have to be very purposeful and intentional about setting the tone of the game early something they didn't do Monday night against Denver falling behind in the first quarter by double figures James from the perimeter rebounded by sabonis simonis has three consecutive triple doubles pardon me yeah triple doubles against this Laker Squad here's Derozan against Davis shoots over the top and rebounded by Reaves James on the Fly Christie couldn't get the handle this is matchup that Sacramento did very well 19 turnover score 25 off but they got to get out in transition Derozan from the corner and Sacramento off to a rather slow start here 0 for three from the field here's Davis James trying to now face up against Derozan they empty out the side with the left hand rebounded by Anthony Davis and the putb he is having just an incredible season here early on and you know when you look at kind of what this Lakers team needs to be successful in the west they need him to be playing at the high high level that he has been Sacramento now old for five to start the game Rings driving Baseline against monk Christie with the catch and two three sabonis got there in time knocked it out of bounds though it'll stay a minute into the game well that was intentional right new coach trying to to get a message across to his players he has a lot more faith and trust in these players now as Keegan Murray gets the chase down block on the Fly Murray he dumps it home oh body snatching inside can take it the full length of the court and avoid James with the chase down block who and that is something he does well LeBron had him on the scope here's James for three and he cashes out Lakers up by eight early here Aaron fox has yet to attempt the field goal in four minutes monk behind the sabonis screen he pulls and that's a great shot I mean Sacramento getting some really good looks within their offense just not knocking things down during the early going of the quarter James took a couple of days off two games off and draws the foul there underneath against a Roan with which wasn't really it was something where he just woke up that morning and there was some soreness there he is recovered and looking good in's offense which has been supercharged since he entered the starting lineup amongst the top five in the NBA after the James they post it up to sabonis and this is the first time they touching paint via Domantas monk working against Reaves a long two by sabonis and one and done for the kings that time the Lakers defense which they've worked on over the last several days has been pretty good so far well and it's something that has been improving over the last few games as well but even go back about 10 and you start to see Improvement as Max chrisy knocks down that corner pocket three so the Sacramento Kings with some early game woes for the second consecutive game nice cck by sabonis for the punch and that's the key right there is being able to touch paint I mean you know this Lakers team defensively they're long they're going to take up a lot of space you cannot settle for outside shots against this Los Angeles Lakers Squad good defense by Murray to push James all the way out to the wing now sabona switches on to him they the mismatch Katie yes and you know that is that is a difficult match up for Keegan to square off against Anthony Davis on that low block but the Kings need to just keep plugging away at this we saw them come back from 23 down in the first quarter uh on Monday against the Nuggets so they just quite haven't found their flow here open the floodgates 11-point Laker lead to start the game here Fox on Reaves around the staggered screen got to the rim and lays it home Derozan on the fly right back at you and that's what Sacramento did so well last year that we haven't seen quite as much this season as running after a m yeah we haven't seen it with consistency right Denver they did an excellent job the other night you go back to the first match up against the Lakers they did an excellent job in that game as well but the Lakers want to slow down the pace of the game they've got some older guys one of them holding the ball right now going to set the minutes record tonight you want to try and get up and down on this team here's Fox to the front Court little hesy on Christie and Anthony Davis showing you why he's an MVP candidate lost the ball Fox and won bonus with three consecutive triple doubles against Los Angeles D'Angelo Russell checking to the Ball Game for JJ reick 8-point lead for the Lakers hurder in the ball game as well for Sacramento pocket pass to Davis Reaves sprays it out to Russell a quick catch and shoot is short aor St down on the pump B Huerter laces it Kevin Huerter injuring that surgically repaired shoulder after taking a hit in that New Orleans spot it's nice to start getting guys healthy bad getting bodies on the floor for Mike Brown it but to see Kevin step in and immediately knock down his first try and Reaves counters with a three at the other end the lead back up to eight yeah Huerter missed that game with the shoulder soreness same surgically repaired shoulder it's a bonus knocks down the three shooting 43% from Deep on the season and it seems to be that way so often one one or two guys start struggling out the gate everyone struggling but as soon as someone starts knocking down a shot or two everyone's confidence is raised ball comes back to Reaves back out to Hachimura tipped up Davis kept it alive loose ball oh my goodness Huerter double team swarmed comes out to M King's on the Move Derozan inside for Sacramento Off the Bench for Mike Brown Davis flips the screen for Reaves Gabe Vincent from nearby Stockton knocks down the Baseline three Vincent telling me prior to tip off tonight he's got about some 20 family members from nearby Stockton visiting him Mom and Dad here at the game tonight not only is he a kind of a local kid as you just said he's also also gjo so I tip my hat and say olay my friend you seeb in the house loose ball good Hustle by and you know if you're Mike Brown that's something to to really have as a luxury to rely on he's been a real Pro and they get the 8sec violation on and here's Reaves Anthony Davis did his work early KD I know as a big you can appreciate that absolutely and that gives me a little bit of a flashback to Monday night Aaron Gordon did the same thing when the Nuggets were in town trying to get Demar DeRozan isolated down there on the cross match tonight here though I don't think that we're going to see that as a drawn up play Keegan Murray and Alex Len getting ready to come back in for Coach Brown Hachimura from the Baseline Mike Brown calls time out the kings run some 45 action for Fox got a great look couldn't convert it another opportunity the result of another Murray offensive rebound Fox overcooks another one and again listen I mean I I feel like when they've had their their best offense against this Lakers team is when they touched the P Crowder take the rookie as wild Gabe Vincent hasn't shot the ball well this year but knocks down another jumper really hasn't shot the ball all that well in a Lakers uniform but his last two years in Miami really was a great perimeter shooter for them that's how he got paid Fox bravs it out to Ellis neon Keon lighting up the night here the lead down to 11 feels to me like a game where Keon is going to find a way to leave leave a big impant on this game they repost it to LeBron Len comes over to show help and they get the stop here's Ellis they flow into some empty Corner action and that's going to be a foul against enough he shoots at right around 40% Fox off to a cold start now one of five James survey was looking a connect instead decides on Russell around the world and the float game is good Kings finding themselves in a hole again in the first quarter down 13 Alex Len draws the foul on the second one and one in ordinate amount of points again in the first quarter like they did against Denver Baseline cut by connect no connection there hurry into the front Court working against James got the blow by but good help defensively James with the bounce pass Russell with the Lan and the Lakers have just had really staun defense at The Rim in this game in the early going so far first quarter what is it four blocks or more Fox with one field goal so far draws the contact and he'll get a trip to the foul line up into that shot and there completely it's easy there's so many different ways to do it yes that time of year again absolutely vote early and often James out top eight on the shot clock the B against Keegan Murray Good Help by Huerter good denight few times score three baskets here he is they only need one fox had it knocked away on the back Tap Out of Bounds here's sabonis back to Fox for the slam oh you love to see it the most dangerous player Katie you know is on an all best paid trip where's that one I think that our I think our families would like that gift from us don't you just dropping hints Alex Lenn inside Huerter on the catch and shoot three bring it up his confidence man I mean he started the season but I dare I say he is very comfortable and confident in that second unit in his role Reaves on the wing back to James Murray with the close out five on the shot clock he's got to get to work going to try and walk down Murray there's that bonded turnaround this time it comes off strong defense from pegan Murray he ran to the rim had it knocked Away by Reaves that's a good defensive play by Austin Reaves good defensive play play and just a little bit of a careless pass that leads two points in transition for the Lakers and listen you know you got to you got to be deliberate with your ball movement T deficit back to eight box off the lens screen spins on Vincent hit and goes right back to the free throw line KD you and I all 27 games so far now make it 28 and high should be duly noted that Mike Brown coaches De'Aaron harder than anybody on this roster you know he comes from the Greg papovich coaching tree and I've seen it as a player and I've seen it in our time with Mike Brown here as well the way that he coaches De'Aaron Fox Domantas sabonis we're in those film sessions we see it and there is a heavy heavy dose of the weight that they have on their shoulders and he is constantly reminding them and holding them that fox is receptive to that tough coach and great players want to be pushed and he certainly does inside the nice dump down to Lenn who draws the foul on I always felt that if your coach is coaching your star players that way rest of the way Isaac Jones ready to come into the ball game was great to see Jay Crowder take the rookie Isaac Jones to meet the officiating crew including Bill Kennedy prior of get tonight part of his get to know you get acquainted sessions and LeBron getting acquainted with the rim again seven-point lead for the Lakers quick three at the other end by Fox left it on the front rim James with the p inside toachi bur had it knocked away Fox was battling that time and it benefited the Kings Murray put a shoulder into LeBron who took the bad end of that Ellis looking inside pardon me Fox inside to sabonis nice slot cut by Murray they couldn't find him he relocates for three and a little bit strong that was great ball movement and Domantas getting it back and fouled he will go to the free throw line what will be his first damage there for Sacramento able to do that with Anthony Davis on the bench hey make this holiday season extra special for the young kings fans in your life folks the 2024-25 kidss club Allstar membership presented by Delta Dental is packed with great gifts a free Kings ticket and more become a member today at kings.com kidsclub you know this Lakers Squad they're 27th in the league in rebounding with the size that they have with Anthony Davis with LeBron and to me that was one of the big Keys coming into tonight is the Kings having that tenacity on the on the glass that we've seen so much Hachimura inside with the left off the feet from James here's Fox back quickly at the other end oh and that's going to be a foul got to love the fact that he looks bothered right now out there if he's angry that's good news for the Kings and now a quick word from Tri County with one of the officials there and uh ready to transform into Training Day Denzel Washington that's when he's at his best yes absolutely we've seen that movie absolutely went ready for the smoke fire and good hands defensively James tipped it out to Haim Murray with six on the shot clock sabonis defending Domantas moving his feet well and they got the Stop Sacramento can cut it to six here early post up but it's knocked away and a foul is going to gos for his birthday he said well he was part of setting up a surprise hard to keep things secret these days but of course he switched his number to number 11 to honor his father this year and great to see really interesting that Dom's father's birthday is today and De'Aaron Fox's birthday is tomorrow you know what I'm saying two important players in his life how about that close succession Huerter tipped it to the wrong team LeBron drives the close up by Murray they clear out the side for James into the paint and couldn't conclude it I really feel like keagan's done a great job in that coverage against LeBron James sabonis happy birthday dad there it is and a turnover by the Lakers Sacramento back to within five on the dribble handoff monk good flash to the free throw line wonderful high low just their ability to get that ball in the from Kevin Huerter and even better the the timing from Dom good movement off the ball wonderful discipline by the Lakers Reaves averaging about 17 points a game this season on in the first quarter Off the Bench we got to look at I mean Keon has been very consistent on the defensive end steals blocks multiples of both in in games monk got it Malik monk through the contact and the Kings now up to 20 points in the paint here and we got a lot of time left in this second quarter that is the key to success for them rik's first field goal Reaves on the cross touches paint good contest by sabonis for the block Derozan on the move against Hachimura the pull Reaves running it back got peeled clean a whistle and after reviewing the play the the defensive foul that was called on number 23 has been overturned unfortunately the foul is now on number nine and the Lakers will retain possession of the ball on the side the coach's challenge is successful I need Bill I'm still learning Bill's Tendencies like we do players you know here's Reaves from Deep Christie tried to keep it alive comes out to Demar DeRozan Lakers doing a nice job of getting back in transition defensively well trust me it was on their Scouting Report they got burned in the first match up Kings had 31 sabonis again K low action is really putting that Lakers defense in a world of trouble ktie is pretty simple they're just flashing a man to the free throw line area Russell with the float game left it short got another opportunity and sabonis clears this time Sacramento with a chance to take the lead Monk on the dho lines up the sees butter and how about that SC a little prayer before he let it fly first lead of the ball game for Sacramento Davis over sabonis sabonis has gotten the edge in that battle the last several times they've played and Russell counters from Deep Los Angeles backed up by one Russell coming off the bench as we all know now three of seven from the field monk off the track screen Reaves went under and he made him pay for it Malik kind of formula to this whole thing with it happening against the Kings I contend that he remains the greatest and then his active voice in the community for social justice initiatives and other economic Endeavors and Beyond I think one of the things that maybe no one talks about with LeBron and we talk about his greatness as Malik mon is just doing some damage against his former team here in the second quarter but to be that young coming into the league and on a personal level to have the discipline in his life that he has had in terms of you know he obviously has known his wife since he is very young they have thrown children now um that's hard to do in this league sabonis on the break monk flying Charter in the first quarter but it didn't take them as long to recover and now it really feels like we got a little bit of juice in the tank yeah the building is Hot Monk has scored the last 10 in a row for the Kings Davis backs down sabonis and one there's a reason why against Memphis on Sunday to go along with 16 rebounds two assists and two steals you know and I think that the way that Anthony Davis started this season he was just absolutely phenomenal and he's maintained as Malik misses that triple attempt to a large degree and a lot of the hit on him has been you know help he's made a glass but he played 76 games last season that's a career best for him lost the handle comes out to Murray Sacramento with a three on two Murray steps through missed it loose ball Christie coming back that wasn't exactly how that was supposed to be scripted right there we got a whistle and a foul will go again coming off an eight-point performance time now for our lead the way Brock box and The Beat Goes On thought to be in the winter of his career but back to spring and summer still and he's only got I think six or seven games to pass dirt for you know games played as well so Derozan made a little bit of space and that's going to be an offensive foul formation point on the contact that Demar did create Sabonis switches on to James Murray trying to guard Davis Lakers trying to post it up Murray pushes Davis out on the mid post five on the shot clock Davis walks him down oh he got it back off the Kum loose ball Davis with another offensive rebound well that's Murray on James that wasn't quite as clean as the Kings would like to have it defensively James on the kick out Gabe Vincent from Deep got it the native of Stockton rattle holes the three ball and the lead is back up to two for the Lakers in a highsc scoring first half and the the Lakers really doing a phenomenal job on these in the glass tonight I talked about it earlier it has not been a strength of theirs this season and it's something the Kings have been able to do well and at a high level consistently Murray touches paint and rebounded by the Lakers here's James guarded by Murray LeBron spins Fire's got the layup Mike Brown calls a timeout monk back to box HK off the sabonis screen got it blocked by Anthony Davis that's what he does Rec has gotten him to play at a higher level of defense this year right now working against sa bonis shot clock below 10 Davis lost the handle and sabonis commits the foul Lakers shooting just is it cookies what what was it is it cookies or chicken or tacos or I don't know it's it's something if it's free it's mean it's a pizza the crowd will get some of it Fox had a great look and De'Aaron having a tough time offensively still plenty of time to Turn the Beat Around here's James behind the Davis screen some touch action with Vincent look at Fox battle LeBron LeBron looking for the contact no call he is so much stronger than people realize Aon shaking his head saying no no coming back the other way there's the pump fake there's the whistle there's the foul there's the Demar Derozan offensive in the game Scout and the game plan top of the scouting that's what if he makes that catch Sacramento wins that game against Denver that last play it was a brilliant play drawn up by the way by Mike Brown very beautiful play uh but you know I always go back to those moments of you can you can single out the last play of the game because it's easy but I remember the first 12 minutes and those were brutal TRS box with the steel surveys Derozan on the fly one more to Murray for three Anthony Davis gets it across they can get a two for one if they want it LeBron with a quick post up on Derozan spins and lays it home with the left hand James with 11 now in the game Fox back quickly and got the nice off hand layup De'Aaron fox still quicker than gossip about a te down Fox Fikes over the LeBron screen they got tangled up that's going to be a foul like the offensive player created that contact and then communicating with Malik monk a moment ago and with Demar Derozan let's see who gets this final pull keep in mind M already having away game here's Monk on the Fly got a nice screen from sabonis and Anthony like when Bruce Lee hits short six inch punch just Bo box with a punch early against the Lakers knocks down his first shot De'Aaron is going to turn 27 years old tomorrow oh my goodness was a while ago I know let's leave it there out you on the Baseline steps out of bounds Reaves right there nothing complicated about it nice brush screen by De'Aaron to free up sabonis the rolling hook comes off to Davis back Mo down by one to start the third quarter now Good Help by Murray they reposted to Davis facing up now got it off quickly and rebounded by Domantas quickly up to Fox but chrisy back in transition fox in the lane had it knocked away they're doing a good job of loading defensively and has the ball in his hands they got to move it quicker and get it back on the other aside yeah he's seeing a lot of bodies shot clock at three and the Kings implode off the turnover because if it did it should be inbounded at the other end right it's going to be almost Baseline out of bounds deep in Sacramento territory here I'm a little conflicted over this right here either way you slice it it's a king's turnover Sacramento has given it away only six times today good hands by Fox oh took his cornbread what a steal by Fox for three tried to keep it alive but it's out of bounds Le he has a pass an absolute pass on the defensive end and Austin Reaves is is the one that's being faced with that problem tonight LeBron with the long two left it on the front rim rebounded by Murray crosscourt to monk left open and he makes them pay Malik monk with 15 now in the ball game and that's the one wide opened in transition and I don't know how that happens defensively but if it does you just pass it on along and knock down some shots Davis with a missm match against Murray walks him down chrisy with the cut back out to Reaves two on the clock monk defending Davis with the follow and that's going to be a foul against sabonis sabonis saying that Davis crash version of what you just intimated a moment ago as Davis knocks down the first Davis ties it at 64 Anthony Davis with 11 points and 12 rebounds monk brings it across oh God from the free throw line draws the foul and that's going to be an offensive foul against monk the officiating crew saying that to the rule book an unusual launch angle I it was the Quick Stop is what gets it James inside with a little jelly at the rim and LeBron James with his fifth field goal he has 13 Fox back in a rush sabonis blocked by Davis and it comes off to James and that is five blocks by Anthony Davis now moving into the top 30 in the NBA in blocks off the Miss here's Derozan nice snap drive by Murray his Teardrop Is Good Nice decisiveness that time he's had a few times tonight where he's gotten that deep in the paint and just been wide open and it's caught him off guard this his second field goal of the game kti Reaves that's going to be De'Aaronen Fox his fourth personal foul with 824 to go here in the third quarter Mike Brown going to in the first half he ear four12 from the field has 15 points four assists four rebounds off the away action Derozan raises up and Reaves with the rebound Good Help by the Kings defensively Murray with the contest and they get a good stop pay attention to that man's defense yeah am I crazy in thinking there might be some consideration for Murray on the NBA's all defensive team with the way he's done against some of the top Wing scores and backb players I think there should be I mean he guarded Anthony Davis tonight and he's guarding Austin Reaves he can guard one through happen maybe I'm used to being in Sacramento but I don't know that it will yet well winning would certainly help tied at 68 Fox to bonis run some pistol action and sabonis dials his own number up did Davis block that again shot clock at five you don't want a foul here Reaves pulls comes off to Christie but mon controls and chrisy with the steel Fox with the foul and that's going to be his fifth so the Gam not quite paying off been very vocal about one of his challenges this season has not just been roster turnover but turn over on his coaching staff with Jordy Fernandez taking the head job with the Brooklyn Nets and you know to me one of the concerning things has been some point you got to kind of figure out a way to to buy them some rest or else Daren might start picking up five fouls in the third quarter and get himself some he'll be sitting for a while yes questiones the pegs right now is where do those points in the back court come from sabonis giving a little bit of a lift there with the slam look how spread out they were on offense that opened up a nice Lane for that Domantas with 14 Action James out to Reaves catch and Sho three on the way way strong and here's m LeBron switches on to sabonis monk against Davis as a result on the hesi tell you what Anthony Davis will make you reconsider your offensive options he's just been Unstoppable around the paint the r roen with a bad Miss Anthony Davis blew that half court set up Hachimura against Ellis put his head down got it blun but Bill Kennedy raises his fist into the air and calls foul that foul will go against Haim Murray at the free throw line knocks down the first as Kevin Huerter comes into the ball game for the Kings had a chance to try his his red wine it's called black samurai oh yeah delicious with chocolatey tones to said black samurai wi inside sabonis with a slam D knows how to procure a bucket that's for sure they've gone to that well twice in a row and he's cashing in getting ready to do some of that heavy lifting with box on the bench with those five fouls out of the horn set Russell takes it from Davis back to Anthony Davis well he and sabon is playing a physical Grand of basketball Davis settles the issue from mid-range Lakers back up by two there's monk inside sabonis got it to fall with the left hand and what's so beautiful about what they're doing right now is they're going and setting screen action between De'Aaron Domantas and they're getting the switch to take Anthony Davis away from the rim and you've got a mismatch Domantas operating on Hachimura down low wow and DLo with a three ball makes it 7774 Los Angeles Russell Off the Bench with 10 points oh out of bounds monk foot initially out of the horn set again Reaves fouled by Ellis you got him can't make that argument there I guess nope so with Fox on the bench Sacramento trailing by three Fox with Reaves an 80% free throw shooter knocks down the second look for De'Aaron on that cross screen action try to post him up and you called it partner whistling a foul been doing this long man and it's still a blend in progress with Derozan here he is on the post up against Max Christie and there's the result they chose the right play Katie and that's where he likes to operate from whether or not they just do a traditional post up or they bring him from the opposite sideline Davis from 15 a little bit strong loose ball Vincent got their first Reaves inside good contest but a better offensive move and Mike Brown calls timeout a little Min series between the two teams see the Kings went out of this timeout Russell not a great defender so they double team DeRozan they get it back to De'Aaron Ellis with seven on the shot clock on the step up sabonis to mon Huerter's got a pull had to not a great offensive possession At All by the Kings the spacing never able to get an advantage Ellis on Reaves Reaves to Davis shot clock down to five Reaves around the Davis screen tough shot good contest Davis couldn't get the follow in Sacramento Returns the favor with a great stop they cleared out for Derozan against Reaves he's got a little food and couldn't eat G connect Ellis got a hand up and force the Miss Nea has been a little bit a rythmic at the off end JJ Reed to that in his pregame news conference as a rookie letting his defense letting his offense be affected by his defense Huerter on the drive yeah they played in their college season her at the free throw line 71% where they have just been one of the best in the League this season and it was quite a turnaround from last year so this is a a close game and really has been through most of the game now Sacramento third in the NBA in free throw shooting here's James Russell against sabonis fires over top tipped out to sabonis mon bounce pass Ellis oh LeBron pinned it he packed it punished it on the glass and at the other end 94 ft of the legend LeBron James and that's going to be a charge against the Kings foul somewhere Andre Galo saying you thought it was just me DLo with the mid-range jumper and the lead is up to seven for the Lakers with under 90 seconds to play in the third quarter and this is a little mini run it's so critical right now that the Kings get a bucket here back out to Murray got to have it that three Falls way back down to four Murray with his third field goal seven points five rebounds oers with a little midp pick and roll Russell directing traffic Haim mura inside got peeled by Monk three on two for the Kings Ellis was running to the corner to the three-point line to the night he's got seven points five rebounds in this but man he has had a brutal mat up C LeBron James not easy work monk shot an air ball lers in a two for one scenario if they want it connect with a nice ball fake and rebounded by Malik it's about a 4 second difference between the shot and game clock as he brings it across Mike Brown calls out the set off the stack pick and roll out to Huerter tried to hit sa bonis tipped away two seconds to go Haim on the break lays it home with neighbors well Lakers leading by six you go to the first match up these teams taking each other on early in the season it was that man right there that did a bunch of damage 11 straight points to start the fourth quarter and that's where they really turned the tides and took that game 16 overall in that fourth quarter interestingly enough Katie to note Fox gets the start in the fourth quarter here playing with those five fouls and we're going to have a whistle and a foul that's going to be very nuanced and tricky for him to be able to stay out of committing that six and final foul down the first threee throw Aon Fox turns 27 tomorrow young man came here and shortly after being drafted he said hey I want to see this city experience a championship I want to be part of rebuilding the culture and the winning ways here in Sacramento a town with great basketball tradition out of the horns set James over to Russell Vincent pulls the three ball got it he's shooting the mess out of the ball tonight like you said earlier the in the game he has been struggling this season but I think he likes playing in front of a friendly crowd right he's got family friends from home about 15 20 people he told me and off the Box turnover Lakers with a chance to make it a nine-point lead G Vincent from Stockton California did I get that right KY oh you're so silly Russell inside got the layup off glass and the lead is up to nine box off to Jones spring Murray into the corner off the Baseline action I like that shot not able to get it to drop but those are the ones that you want the Rhythm LeBron with some bounce in his step missed the layup here's fox in a rush Huerter up TI Jones with the jam and I love that because makers run some horns twist Russell says on the man for the job ised Bo stairs down reddish spins tough shot Darren Fox touching paint and he'll take two free throws to go I me in this moment right now as he knocks down the first of two foul shots as if to say you're not going to stop me from where I want to get to and they haven't been able to I mean this is going to be his 11th free throw attempt tonight the kings of shot 22 now as a group go two for two makers lead down to five vinsent brings it across to Russell James on the wing stairs down Murray and they clear everybody awayan is on an island BR back out one more reddish for three and Jones with the rebound fox in full flight pulls it out and left it on the front rim James downhill knocked away after being tied up Ellis off the bounce pass Ellis with the slam and again arguing the call and the Kings get a dunk on the other end that is exactly how you're going to continue to beat into this lead Hachimura inside Jones sports the Miss Fox around the world but lost the handle yeah the game trying to get into the paint draw some fouls and kind of dictate action we've seen chunks of of times offensively for the Kings where they start to gain momentum Chelsea and they've got some nice flow to their offense but then it stagnates and it goes away what are you seeing there man they're never going to get the lead in this game if they don't have backto back possessions that's really good looks at the basket you know you want to take great shots right now in this fourth quarter and that's going to be key to get them back in this ball game and hopefully Take the Lead but they can't afford to have three of unsettling possessions this game has been a little bit choppy so if they're able to do that they'll be able to gain the lead all right thanks especially live action we have a hard time recognizing it on on camera in slow mo but to Chelsea's Point you'll have a few good offensive possessions but then you kind of the offense slows and stagnates a little you're not getting it they've got three team fouls at this point there's that Zoom action off the pin down fox out of the right corner going to his left hand it's cash in the B three-point ball game De'Aaron up to 21 Reaves off glass oh no Wow Mike Brown contesting that it was maybe a kick no kickball called off the turnover seven and a half to go burer trying to stop ree reddish back out toReaveswho relocates Russell tipped up by Davis lost it right to Huerter W what a battle down there mad scrambled Anthony Davis has just been he's been great in this game not even as a rim protector but as a rebounder boy Austin Reaves off ball defense tipped that away for the steal turnovers have become a problem here in the second half in particular for S Sacramento fourth quarter it is not been a good look pocket pass to Anthony Davis he left it short loose ball out of bounds Lakers basketball with 647 to go get it Davis fouled by sabonis so you got to be careful there's a lot of time left in this game the good news is that strategically Luke LS and Mike Brown of you're just talking from a basketball sense I know we're analyzing the Kings game but you know you want de if you're Mike Brown and the Kings to be in the game for the whole fourth quarter but if you're JJ Reed if you don't so why in the world aren't you seeking out the switch because every team in the league switches guard to guard but they're not they're not looking for that action seven-point Laker lead monk will bring it across garon working off ball in the right corner here's Fox again off that same action pop clutch got to the rim and puts it home De'Aaron fox with 23 can just be filthy at times an imperious De'Aaron Fox is a lethal De'Aaron Fox the lead down to five he has 23 pocket pass to Anthony Davis left it short rebounded by the Kings they got numbers here as Davis turned his ankle it's a five on four one more to the corner B for three and it comes off loose ball scramble sabonis on the deck and we're going to have a jump ball with russle and sabonis you got to give credit to the Lakers players that were able to at least sabonis and Russell jump sabonis and Russell who jump it up here back in for the Lakers that LeBron James look up loose ball Russell out top monk went under the screen M switched onto him LeBron with the catch and shoot three short tough night shooting for him six of 18 box cut up on the Baseline DeRozan aggressive close out by LeBron James thanks back out to Murray tough fade away he had a better shot before that five minutes to play well B's flailing and flying around off the Miss Max Christie with the offensive rebound you got to come up with those balls at this point in the game l five minutes to go you're trailing by five it is Davis inside and that's going to be a foul against the bonus and he's in s pardon me fifth now that one was a mistake for sure the technical foul was a mistake might be rescinded but what is not is the free throw that is shot during the game we know impressive double double these battles between him and sabonis have become the version of California NBA version of basketball lore well you know both of them with a double double tonight Domantas beting in that category that's is number 24 tonight but he's two assists away from a triple double so you know do yeah Fox got to the office sprays it out to Derozan for three get it get it and Davis with his 19th paring James in the front Court got a mismatch with Monk on him you're running out of time here you got to get stops that's not one of them the leak swelling to 11 m brown right now he is at 11 points for Los Angeles Kings have to work expeditiously here four minutes to go off the Touch action Fox back out to monk open look for three great design not the result that they desired Reaves with the rebound a beautiful shot too it looked good soon as it left his hand LeBron inside wow somebody went flying who was that roen and LeBron James with 17 now the lead is at 13 the Kings offensively without any kind of Rhythm or flow yeah and I mean that is enabled a 12 to2 run for this Lakers team in that there with the triple it is back to 10 but you have to get stops here I mean You' got to get stops you only got three minutes to work with and you can't string them together if you can't get stops fighting through that screen Foxx's got a hand on it sabonis got a hand up Davis it just doesn't matter when he starts to get it going tough shot and anything that's what you want to give R roen fouled by LeBron James a focal point offensively and you said it the six blocks really completes his game Fox with a tough contested three an arhythmic offense right now just join it two and A2 minutes to go there's that familiar Hornet they keep running and Murray had LeBron around the neck James James playing with his food out to Hachimura from the Baseline and Derozan controls quickly up the M sabonis lost the handle and it goes right to Austin Reaves in a snapshot that's been the night offensively for Sacramento that's a travel KN put the floor James out top who tonight became number one on the list of minutes played in the league long two oh no and Davis with the offensive rebound put back and then them getting that that switch off right there takes domos away from the glass where he has just done a brilliant job tonight of contending with Anthony Davis Christie with the steel another costly deleterious turnover and right now Sacramento suffering from a torn motivator cuff certainly a lot of self-inflicted issues here especially in the fourth quarter that the turnovers and I'm I I can I can remember at least three that were in the unforced category and that'll do it Austin Reaves with the bucket and it's 111 to 95 the king's hemorrhaging lead in this ball game Murray knocks down to nugatory 3 so the the good news is the Kings get to face this team in two days and they have a chance to take kind of what they did tonight and what they learned and what the what the Lakers did well against them and see how they can gain the advantage here in 48 middle pick and roll with James and Reaves LeBron with the left lays it home up to 19 on the night Sacramento mention will take on this Lakers team again in a couple of nights and then play them for a third time nine days from now as the Kings will fall to 13 and 15 and at some point k you start to be very concerned with leaking oil at the crib you want the lights to stay on you want this to be a place where you can secure a certain confidence of homec court advantage but it's not happening yet the West is so brutal that you can't get yourself in a you know in a hole that you can't get out of cuz there's not a lot of leeway fore fore foreign for foree speee spee foree oh
