 games Washington tosses it and we are underway Grizzlies won both of the prior meetings November the 29th here in Memphis 12 109 then December 27th in New Orleans 13214 Bane comes up firing and fills it up early uce for Desmond Bane who has hit for 20 or more in 10 of the last 11 the thing with Desmond Bane is the array of ways that he has shown offensive capabilities here you see there the hand off to the mid-range pullup shock block down to nine Jeremiah Robinson Earl finds BC underneath it againsts Edey and they swallow it up Edey with the takeaway Bane working against Trey Murphy theis Jaren against Robinson Earl lobs it up for Edey and he finishes with a hook love the big to Big passing there Jaren Jackson Jr the help comes finds Edie and Edie great job catching and finishing immediately CJ McCollum gets away from Jaylen Wells and buries the jumper than for CJ McCollum he also does a great job of using screens and because Dejounte Murray back playing means that he can go back to his more normal role of playing off the ball Jaren over Robinson Earl gets teaser to drop in and the reality is that Jaren can shoot over anybody that New Orleans can put on the floor even e and and Robinson hurl his only chance is if he can get physical with Jaren to keep him away from that area of the floor Murray crossing over nearly lost it crowded by Bane and threw it right to Jaylen Wells Kennard an open three Bango how about a 9-2 start for the Grizzlies four of the five starters have scored this Grizzlies team again coming out understanding you don't want to give any confidence to this team as CJ McCollum says he'll continue to handle the scoring as he did the last time these teams matched up Kennard drives underneath the bucket McCollum averaging 31 a game on 56% shooting against the Grizzlies Kennard works his way around Missi shot clock down to seven Bane give way Jaren in a corner three that's through and The Grizzlies start five for five with four assists on five baskets the ball is moving well and bodies are moving first two games they're averaging 33 assists versus Pelicans defense mullum shoots again misses this time in the rebound to Edey McCollum one of 10 players in the NBA to rack up a 50-point game this season Kennard and a foul on Trey Murphy the third I tell you this much he did he made that game of scoring for CJ Mccollum made it look very easy when he did it you see here Zach Edey does a great job of staying down and attacking the basketball and then on the other end Jaren rewarding the big fella with an easy one said well know what if everybody's getting easy shots give me easy Corner three Kennard drives foul line sends it scores it redot start for the Grizzlies Kennard with five off a season I 23 on Wednesday night against Charlotte so Luke before basketball game don't touch me with that left hand no keep that left hand away from me that'll leave bur marks the jante Murray fires fills it up this is a Pelicans team very comfortable even without Brandon Ingram playing in the mid-range well because there are two guards that'll be their scorers and shot takers both enjoy playing in the mid-range Missi can't defend Zach Edey this is something that Jaren Jackson Jr the coaching staff has been working with Jaren about being a better passer because he's going to be double and triple team so often this he's being a playmaker with Zach Edey here to start is Jon Murray knocking down the mid-range jump New Orleans starts four of six their starting back court has all nine points five by McCollum and four by Dejounte Murray you see here how about this Jaren recognizing the front there throws the ball perfectly over the top where Zach Edey only has to catch and finish Wells picked up by McCollum Grizz finally a Miss Jeremiah Robinson Earl former Oklahoma City Thunder Trey Murphy thei he has had an unbelievable month of January and earns a trip to the free throw line Murphy in the last five is averaging 26 a game on 48% shooting 41% from three and in the Pelicans you think about and probably mindset wise where the Grizzlies were last season and that this year the injuries derailed a lot of their early success early opportunity to have success but you are able to find some positives and the positive is that Trey Murphy the third takes a step forward so next season you think you have Zion back you still have this nucleus with Dejounte Murray CJ Mccollum you would hope that this season help Trey Murphy and what they expect to do moving forward Brandon Ingram has been out on good portion of the Year Jaren picks up his first foul goes to the bench Gigi Jackson checks in for him well New Orleans has lost the third most games to injury this year they have the third West worst road record but they're seven and four here in the month of January think they still have scoring blocked there by McCollum getting back defensively and here comes Trey Murphy fourth in the league of free throw percentage split the last pair challenges Edey and draws a foul that'll put him back at the free throw line and in this four game winning streak New Orleans is averaging 28 free throws attempted per game they have lived at the L we see the right hand there before the block the contact before is where the whistle is blown and another function of the not just settling for threes because they do play downhill because they do play off the dribble then they gives them the opportunity to get fouls and get to the free throw line wow Murphy is a 91% free throw shooter and he's missed two of three Willie Green has had to deal with just a continual revolving door this year they've used 23 different lineups and only two have been used for more than three games and 16 starting lineups have been used for just one game Kennard is open yes you might want to guard number 10 you might want to guard him especially at the three-point line because if you looked up he's the number one three-point shooter in the association Grizzlies well they're sharing it as well six assists on eight made baskets they lead it by 8 and The Grizzlies next home game is tomorrow don't have to wait long for it Grizzlies will be hosting Utah it is Spirit Night presented by Varsity Spirit get here early the first 5,000 fans through the doors get a Grizz girl poster to get your tickets and for more information visit the FedEx from box office or go to grizzlies.com tickets how hot were the Grizzlies against Charlotte the other night well it's a subject of our Taco Bell take for the just the 16th time in team history 50% field goal percentage 40% three-point percentage 90% free throw percentage 14-2 alltime first time since a home win over Cleveland back in October of 2021 Dejounte Murray double clutches and then throws it away good close out by Bane listen it was CJ McCollum closed out and got a block on Desmond Bane's jump shot Desmond Bane good job getting back into play forcing a turnover for M and Desmond Bane's number will be retired at TCU very well deserved yeah very well deserved Kennard down the lane lobs it up for Edey has to gather himself and then misses Kennard with a save Edey want another chance at it instead it's Bane down the lane his floater is short and the rebound to dejon Murray as we check in with Rob Fischer well Coach Jenkins during that time I was talking a little bit about what you guys were mentioning about the free throws lately for New Orleans he said we got to do a better job defensively not bailing them out of the play and giving them free shots at the free throw line he said offensively we're getting wide open looks offensively because we're attacking and we're pushing the ball he said keep that up six assists on eight made basket wow GG Jackson a big time offensive rebound off the Edey Miss Wells for three Bango man the ball movement is just unbelievable tonight so he went from another shot that they were going to contest Desmond Bane giving go gets it back but then the defense reacts again he finds Wells wide open jante Murray with a spin and a fade away that's in and if not for New Orleans shooting 75% the Grizz to be running away with this thing well you're going to have a lot of one-on-one defense in this basketball game against the Pelicans screens and then you're going to have to get back in front as quickly as possible and Grizz turned it over for the first time tonight Brandon Clarke Scotty pipp Jr into the game and Grizzlies eight assists on nine baskets so the assists have been in the Grizzlies favor all season but very much so against his Pelicans team this year he said averaging 33 versus the Pelicans this year grizz's 36 against Charlotte on Wednesday night Grizzly's also had 21 three-point makes the second time they've had 20 or more they set a franchise record with 27 in the home win over golden jeon Murray works his way into the lane his Fade Away jumper dances and drops in that's his shot he he has been making that shot since he with the San Antonio Spurs that was where he wanted to get to B going downhill blocked by Missi third leading shot blocker among rookies at one and a half a game McCollum gets to his spot and makes see right now the ability of these two guards to knock down mid-range shots Gigi to the cup TS it in Javon green has come on replacing Jeremiah Robinson Earl for the Pelicans and Pippen nearly had to take away Jon Murray had his pocket pick yeah GG Jackson made this makes this driving layup here for the gri and this could be a game for G some extended minutes for him said no jar no Santi Aldama that meant that the bench got a little smaller but it also no Jake laravia and so this allows GG Jackson the opportunity to have minutes and meaningful minutes on the floor tonight getting the early call tonight Daniel Theis into the game along with Jordan Hawkins Hawkins is on a good offensive run averaging 14 a game in the has three Murray behind a Theis screen missed the leaner rebound tapped out two TI green staying active Murphy and Gigi with a rebound gets it to Bane always a good idea Clarke backs down against Tyson B it in oh man that that's a BC bounce well we don't talk about a lot of physical moves from Brandon Clarke but that was a physical move and how about to finish with the left hand Dejounte Murray with a baseline Runner Dejounte Murray is cooking he is six of seven for a dozen points already GG and the foul we talking about what was what could GG Jackson bring to this team and everyone talking about are they going to make a trade they make the thing is they can make a they don't have to make a trade and they're going to get players because they've been out with injury you see Brandon Clarke here able get to the basket finish with that left hand and then on the other end again GG Jackson being able to play off of the dribble getting to the basket free throw coming for a three-point play I mean basically it's like getting a couple of free agents halfway through the season you still haven't even Vince Williams J still hasn't come back he only played the two games before he went out with the ankle injury and so you want to get new players well you you're going to get new players but they're your own players GG Jackson converts the and one the lead back to eight it's been as high as nine Theis rebound battle for Clarke Taylor Jenkins was effusive in his praise of Brandon Clarke oh nice drop off but in crowded space and The Grizzlies lose it out of bounds two guys cut wanted to Dun listen I don't mind that you don't mind an aggressive turnover and at least it was a dead ball so allows the gries to get back defensively Trey Murphy Baseline too strong and again two guys going for the rebound Bane weaving his way through traffic hunting a three comes up short however and the rebound to Hawkins this New Orleans team they came from 25 down on Monday against Utah their game on Wednesday against Milwaukee was postponed because of the snow that blanketed New Orleans and Murray man he's got 14 already he averages 17 a game well right now he he is getting to his spots on the floor which is into that mid-range right around 15 ft GG Jackson misses the three the rebound to Theis but in the last four New Orleans has won their last four they're averaging 124 a game Murray drives Bane thought he got a block but air in the whistle and free throws coming for Dejounte Murray Murray was averaging 18 a game in the two games against the Grizzlies so far he's got 14 and we'll head to the fre throw line when we come back Vante Murray having his way the former Washington Husky shoot your shot to score a VIP experien Tony Allen's Jersey retirement night you see Zach Randolph Marcus all

gotten just an unbelie a a star studded Cavalcade of people for that documentary about the career of Tony Allen I'm with you I hope you're not telling something cuz you told a lot yeah I'm sorry if I spoiled it but it's something to look forward to for sure GG Baseline flips it up no would have been a shot clock violation but it's cleared by Dejounte Murray and right now it's just the Grizz have to do a better job of slowing down the back court of this Pelicans team 10 of 12 from the floor are Murray and McCollum Hawkins misses a three Jaren Jackson Jr back in the game Pippen drives against Murphy off the glass and in for Scotty Pippen Jr left hand move there but Scot P Jun did a good job of he used the body first to create the space to be able to finish Pippen guarding Dejounte Murray at the moment see how that Battle Turns out going to be a team effort though with Dejounte Murray and McCollum tonight Murphy picked up by Bane deep three Murphy just caught the rim barely and it's out of New Orleans will get it back watch a little hit with the shoulder right here doesn't allow Trey Murphy to fully Elevate to try to block the shot and then you see Jaren going for the basketball not able to come up with it Pelicans 14 on a shot clock John Konchar getting an early call John has been more or less out of the rotation but without Jake laravia he gets the call Theis hits the floater over Clarke and a number of these Pelican shots right from where TI just knocked down his shot right underneath that free throw line Bane drives on Hawkins sets up Pippen a rthm three by Scotty off the back iron Clarke Taps the rebound pippens got it no look pass for Clarke but surpris Clarke and it's out of bounds Luke Kennard J Huff going to enter for the Grizzlies here with 65 seconds remaining in the first period number j h l he's the Memphis Grizzlies microwave yes 13 points in the last game in seven minut seven or eight minutes seven minutes officially McCollum is back on the floor by the way for New Orleans Memphis microwave double imp mullum knocks down another one I that's another three for him the offensive he and uh him and Murray here in his first quarter has been fantastic Jaren backs down Theis knocked it free tippen comes top side tend to shoot Scotty drives flips it up and earns a trip to the free throw line B's going to be called on CJ McCollum so McCollum and Dejounte Murray are a combined 11 of 13 and they have 25 points of the 29 scored by New Orleans and the problem right now is they're getting to their spots to score the one the one thing you will live with is if they are making contested shots from multiple places on the court CJ McCollum has gotten to the three-point line open he's got to the little mid-range pullup the only thing that Murray has done has gotten to the mid-range pullup the entire night his spots when he wants to pull up not enough of a contestant when you play against really good scoring guards you want to force them into as many uncomfortable situations neither has been uncomfortable to this point Konchar guards McCollum McCollum drives oh a hop snuff and a save H for three I was teasing him before the game I said first touch you're launching he said yes he only knows that especially if he is open at the top of the key Huff did hit three of six from Beyond on Wednesday night Murray oneon-one Hawkins for three nope and that'll do it for the first quarter Grizzlies are the League's leading first quarter scoring team and they're right around their average with 33 in the first period however the Grizzlies with work to do defensively Pelicans coming up with 55% shooting in that first quarter but the Grizzlies they've been sharing the basketball 11 assists on 13 makes Grizzly's banking from Pinnacle play hard Bank easy second quarter begins here at FedEx form our first look this season at Jose Alvarado been bothered by a hamstring issue for a large portion of this season he's on the floor with Missi McCollum green and Hawkins and a wide open look for javante green Huff fors the Miss it's Jackson Jaren Luke Kennard Pippen Konchar and Huff h down the lane and skitted and travel let's say the The Good the one thing that the Pelicans have done a good job tonight is if they've gone to contest a shot they've done a good job of contesting and either getting themselves back into the play to contest or block the shot or even to be back in front defensively as me does there to force the travel from Huff fourth Grizzlies turnover pelicans have been very ball secure in this winning streak they're averaging 12 turnovers a game in the last four all Pelican wins now Alvarado great drop off to Missi that's the added Dimension that they have with Jose Alvarado that they have not had for a large portion of this season alvorado this is just a 22nd game in which he's played Jaren a rhythm three around and off boarded by Missi this should be a fun match up with Alvarado and Scotty Pippen Jr talking about two pit bulls in the association see defensively the change for the gries any scream with the hands pipp any scream mullum is in they are trapping and then Hawkins takes it away for Pippen and reverses it in so you need your teammates to let you know there's a guy running behind well the turnover issue Grizzlies have turned it over five times it's resulted in nine New Orleans points here's another turnover New Orleans looking for their first lead of the game there's a knock Away by Pippen as Jaren up ahead flares it out out Konchar with a walk up three Bango GG with the three ball nice F by Jaren Jackson Jr foul there on Scotty pippen Jr with against Alvarado but one thing the Grizzlies have done a great job of tonight is they've been able to find open teammates and because of those open teammates they've been able to knock down shots 12 assists for the Grizzlies on 14 May baskets Grizzlies average 29 and half assist per game that's second best in the NBA and rout with another 20 assists per half they had 20 against the hornet in the first half Al verado will cast a three and Miss badly green great effort saves it and Hawkins pays it off pelic alado yep Jaren look out behind Kennard for three and a rebound to mey Grizzlies went wire to wire against Charlotte Pelicans trying to break that string McCollum two at the free throw line off of Jaylen Wells foul talking about with McCollum you saw it when it was a screen set and Jaren is defending when BC was in the game I mean when Huff was in the game in the second quarter there was a trap but with Zach Edey being the defender of the screen he is still going to be an either drop coverage or maybe a step or two close closer to the screen they're not going to force him to be a guy that is trying to trap on screen and roll scenarios Jeremiah Robinson Earl is in and green is out for CJ McCollum he's averaging 22 and a half against the Grizzlies in his career with Portland and New Orleans and the Pelicans have their first lead of the game it is the highest scoring average against any team except Detroit against whom he also averages 22 and2 Kennard 43 League's leading three-point percentage shooter is 75% tonight you remember there was a time where we used to sit over here and be like Luke stop pump faking shoot the basketball well there you don't have to tell Luke to do any shooting at this point the aggressiveness is there on the offensive end we're seeing the best of Luke Kennard I think as an NBA player right now by far Hawkins knocks down to three Jordan Hawkins 47% from Beyond The Arc in the last three games well you're going to see ha not going to do a lot of passing no do a lot of shooting you got to get ready for him to be a volume shooter Jackson against Missi accepts the body contact Edey offensive rebound and gets that one to drop Zach Edey second only to Eve Missi in Second Chance scoring among NBA rookies and The Grizzlies back to the lead at 41- 40 Alvarado lobs for Missi and he finishes and The Grizzlies called timeout Taylor Jenkins cannot be happy with the Grizzlies defense right now New Orleans is shooting 59% from the floor they have the lead back 4241 Pelicans coming from nine down tonight they came from 25 down on Monday against Utah he as we tell you that lady athletes if you're between the ages of 10 and 14 you should sign up now

game so register now at grizzlies.com Junior Grizzlies all right Rob Fisher what's going on in that Grizzlies HL I'm guessing they're talking defense no actually a lot of defense last time but this time out it was more offense and what Taylor doesn't like what he's seeing here recently he said we're just bringing up the ball and just jogging up the floor he said we're making things tougher on ourselves offensively we got to get that pace back up here's playing at the fastest Pace in the NBA Wells with five to shoot nowhere to go missed the turnaround jumper loose ball picked up by Jeremiah Robinson Earl and I think here's Hawkins with a transition three puts it in partner there is no passing when the ball gets to his hands if he a bit of daylight is going up Jaren with the leaner Hawkins in his second season out of Yukon I thing that they the Pelicans the second quar a lot more physical on the defensive side that has didn't allow the Grizzlies the ease in the half court offense New Orleans trying to do something they have not done all year that has beat a plus 500 team on the road Hawkins boarded by Edey shot clock down to 10 Kennard nowhere to release that shot he's crowded by Missi got it back three on the shot clock and we threw it right to Jeremiah Robinson ear was trying to hit Konchar in the corner walk up three by CJ McCollum is off and that's a gift you would expect McCollum to knock that one down Kennard's calling for it it's deep it's a three and it's through they're going to continue to pressure Luke Kennard when he has to take multiple dribbles on no dribbles and no contests they're in trouble McCollum lost it got it back and Jaren has picked up his second foul bit on the pump fake and McCollum to the free throw line where he is two for two tonight see a Jaren great job head up the floor defensively Pelicans late Luke Kennard makes him pay release rotate Splash McCollum curiously enough is just 71% from the free throw line on the season way below his Benchmark yes but this New Orleans team it it's like when they flip the calendar to 2025 everything changed through the end of December they were averaging 106.7 points per game in January they're averaging 10 points more per game mullum makes both but in this basketball game what we've seen is they're not waiting around it's not a halfcourt offense they're pushing the ball and they're putting the ball in their two best scores hands allowing them to be the guys that initiate and make plays Wells against Robinson Earl down the lane flips it up and in Jaylen Wells with six with five I big you're pardon leading rookie score in the league at 11.9 the reason why they had the nine-point lead early was because they were able to get multiple stops can they get back to getting multiple stops against his pelic offense Hawkins forced inside the arc a side step jumper rolls out what's the old line he won't even pass the salt at dinner salt old pepper Kennard crossing over kcha Rhythm three too strong rebound McCollum Hawkins feeling it partner you wouldn't know if he was feeling it or if he wasn't feeling it he he's going to shoot no matter what he was three for three from three against Utah as G steps back and misses I said this physicality on the defensive side and the efforts defensively have forced the grizzly to be all perimeter and his Pelicans team especially with Alvarado in the game has been nothing but downhill touching the paint getting easy scoring opportunities yeah Pelicans shooting 54% from the floor for this season they're 26 in the league at 44% but they have found gaps in the Grizzlies defense and they lead it by four since Christmas he's averaging 13 a game and four assists and in the last 17 games he's shooting 52% from three and tonight with four of five from downtown that percentage is going up is it is the aggressiveness at which Luke Gard has played here as of late and and because of it we've been able to see him not just knock down the threes the threes are the last couple games but we've seen him get to the basket make plays for his other for for his teammates proba we talk about him being the guy that is bringing the flavor Wing Stop the heart very much bringing the flavor bringing the flavor bringing the offense got to start tonight without johnar no Morant no Aldama no laravia GG Jackson against Jeremiah Robinson Earl swings the hook oh BC with the follow shout out Canada we said BC was back couple weeks ago I don't know if BC dunks that putb he might have had the put back but it might have been more of a lay in at that point the confidence and that Achilles is there speaking of confidence Hawkins has 13 points all here in the second quarter Robinson Earl backs down against GG they're trying to get Hawkins a shot shot clock is down to four he crosses over got BC in the air missed it badly Missi offensive rebound Missi Alvarado cutting back door spins around and finishes well the other thing that's hurting Griz the offensive rebounds here for the Pelicans in this second quarter more so leading to basket well they're converting everything five offensive rebounds for 10 second chance points only had two in the first quarter Bane Pippen Alvarado closes out Pippen drives and Banks it in Pippen with six Off the Bench also a couple of steals tonight Grizzlies get the turnover lob finished by Pippen and a timeout take taken by New Orleans as the Grizzlies have come from four down to tie the game at 54 Grizzlies 11 fast break points they average 17 a game timeout taken by New Orleans 359 remaining in the first half Grizzlies with 7even presented by for Midsouth Ford dealers check your local listings in grizzlies.com for the channel guide Utah played really well against Oklahoma City took Oklahoma City to the wire a couple of nights ago and now all of these teams the Grizzlies the Thunder all of these teams that are at the top the rockets that are at the top of the conference and you play against these teams that are down the bottom that that is their Super Bowl that is their championship game so you're going to get their best their best play Dejounte Murray back in McCollum is out Murray with 15 points in the first quarter a quarter in which he shot Seven of eight Trey Murphy is back on the floor Murphy only two points and those coming from the free throw line Theis crowded Hawkins lost control of it picked up by Clarke in the corner trying to create off the bounce desperation he got iron but nothing more than that talk about Brandon Clarke and being able to have multiple roles great job defensively Gigi for three and rattled but it went and the brizes go up three off their eighth triple of the game nice to see GG finding a little bit of a rhythm here with this Grizzlies team Murphy Hawkins again forced inside the arc he drives this time and 15 for Jordan Hawkins Off the Bench he averages 11 Wells for three put it in partner whichever one of these teams decides to play a little bit of Defense they will be able to have a big lead in this game CU right now neither team able to come up with the stops grizzli a 10-2 run Murphy got around Clarke flips up a prayer and then a late whistle on Brandon Clarke so Murphy to the free throw line where he is two of four tonight as you look at Jaylen Wells he has made more threes than any other rookie in the NBA nice timely pass there by Dez to allow him to be able to get the shot off before the full contest could get there Orleans is well rested they haven't played since Monday snowed in jcks J back in Milwaukee was was there trying to trying to play they they went down there to play they went in early on Monday went three days of no gym no doing anything last night they had to fly into Milwaukee right before their game against the Miami Heat they go on to dismantle the Miami Heat but literally get off of the plane and everybody goes to the gym to get ready for the game Pippen drives underated had a good look he did everything but the Finish Murphy javante green back in and hits a three this is a New Orleans team they don't rely heavily on the three they're more of a mid-range threat than they are a three-point threat but Bane misses that three reeled In by Trey Murphy looks they've got great looks from the three-point line if you don't get Great Looks those are the ones that you want to take Murphy drives Clarke stays down defensively shot clock at 10 for Dejounte Murray under two remaining in the first half Murphy off the bounce Jaren blocked it it'll stay with New Orleans but is 2.8 on the shot clock McCollum is back in with Murray Murphy green and tights good help here by jaren timing there to be able to come up with the block Murphy tries to get himself all the way to the basket jaren's first block on the night 2.8 on the timer muray to throw in and Pippen will get called for a foul Grizzlies thought it was clean take another look we're going to say Mark Lindsay said there was contact to the Head maybe I think on that angle there that angle there maybe I see CJ McCollum's head move somewhat but this is we talked about it earlier the 71% from the free throw line CJ McCollum that missed there let's see he gr it yeah he great he does y yep Mark Lindsay was on it it wasn't much but it was there it was enough that if you challenged you would have lost right mullum one of two from the line yeah that was a good no challenge by the Grizzlies there wasn't anything there to overturn it for sure and in all honesty was the right call bane driving sets up a Jaren corner three nope boarded by javante Green think about this first half really hav that Jaren good defense there G G with the knock away it'll stay with the Pelicans 14 on the shot clock so that aggressive defense from the Pelicans really haven't allowed the Grizzlies to throw the ball into Jaren in the mid post to allow him to play the individual defense forc him out on the floor and then the pressure on the basketball forcing the ball away from Jaren both teams shooting well over 50% both teams 43% from three Murphy lines up a three and puts it in New Orleans it's largest lead of the night GG Jackson against Trey Murphy backs him down spins inside and hits I was talking about his ability to create shots he said without Santi Alama you're going to need for G to step in and gii 10 big points here in his first half that ends a 90 New Orleans run but Murray get free in the lane throws up a wild shot tipped in by Theis and again an offensive rebound for New Orleans they have been very efficient on their second chance opportunities Pippen drives against Dejounte Murray and again misses at close range run out Javon green and he Powers it down Grizzlies have surrendered 69 first half points the issue is you're not getting the initial stop defensively but you're also not clearing the defensive backboard which is making it a highly efficient first half for the Pelicans yeah they're have not been many empty possessions for New Orleans sh 3 is short BC can't get the follow 5 seconds remaining in the period Grizzlies don't have a foul to give oh pipp and taking a three shot foul oh my just not a good play that's not a smart play in that situation ation you get the three free throws you allow the Pelicans here an opportunity to make this a 10-point lead going into the half and Gigi what he brings to his team he said they needed more guys who could create their own shot off of the dribble so Gigi with the ability to do that Pelicans it is their highest scoring first half this year this is on the heels of such a dominating first half in LA in the last game for the Grizzlies 7848 lead for them going into the half against the Hornets yeah and the Grizzlies are right at their seasonal average for first half scoring it's just the defense and rebounding has uh let the Grizzlies down it's abandon here in this first half Luke Kennard comes in with 1.8 Grizzlies might get a look at a three here so they get Kennard on the for and GG Jackson goes to the bench I would expect to see a more physical Grizzlies defensive team in the second half Murray two of three nine-point lead with 1.8 Kennard from Beyond half court everybody was holding their breath included looked like it had a chance well Willie Green has to be absolutely thrilled with his team offensively they have been on point tonight they put a 42o second quarter on the board they lead the Grizzlies by nine halftime has arrived and the Pelicans are up 9 7162 let's get to our ory coach's halftime report it's Jason march with Rob fer coach that second quarter got away from you guys they did a lot of things that you guys like to do run get out on the break they were able to do a lot of things get big assist numbers what do you need to shore up defensively yeah we I mean they picked up their Pace just like you said we've got to do a better job of getting into bodies don't let them kick it ahead but then getting back and taking away those transition threes they got to they kind of got to the corners got a lot of corner threes we got to take those away offensively like what you see so far yeah it's been good we're we're doing a good job attacking we've had some great looks got to the rim got to keep the pressure in the paint that's important for us good luck second half thanks the Orion coach's halftime report Orion is your financial Game Changer and really when you when you look at at it both these teams shooting well the assist numbers are the same the problem is the grizz's minus five on the glass the assist numbers are the same it's the free throw line Pelicans 12 of 17 the Grizzlies only three attempts in the entire first half and none in the second quarter Pelicans didn't commit a foul in the second quarter well the other thing was that the Pelicans were enable to play up and down at a fast pace 15 fast break points they had in that second quarter quarter and for the season they averaged 16 and a half so you you saw and a lot of that I thought was they were the more physical basketball team in that second quarter when we said whichever team could buckle down defensively will be able to expand on the scoreboard it was the Pelicans in that second quarter let's see if the Grizzlies who who have done a great job this year of being able to go into the locker room make the necessary adjustments and then come out and execute that game plan grizz's 5 and 11 when they Trail at half time pelicans pelicans actually have a losing record when they lead at halftime they're six and 11 well par we only got 12 wins it means that you got there's some negatives that you have going on yes there are yes there are but of those 12 wins for the Pelicans seven have come here in the month and they're trying to make it eight and they have extended to the largest lead for either team tonight they're up 11 griz's had an early nine-point lead and the Pelicans wiped that away in the second quarter jaren trying to feed it inside and a foul Jeremiah Robinson ear was defending non shooting foul Jaren pleading for free throws Justin vany says no well that that last play partner was evidence of how physical Jaren started the post up in the mid post he finished the post up at the three-point line and then had to try to make a play from there pay on a throwback a Jaren three it's through for Jaren Jackson Jor second of the game 10 for Jaren they're going to need for Jaren and Dez to be big here in this third quarter Missi with a punch big time punch foul edting W Missi the six leading score at nine a game and a pocket pass from McCollum and Eve Missi out of Baylor Big Time smash remember we talked earlier that Zach Edey is not going to get up to be able to do any type of trap situation the only thing he can do is move one step closer but the one step that he move me with seven he has a couple of blocks as well Bane with nine assists tonight Jaren yes and the foul that should be a 10th assist Bane foul and Jeremiah Robinson Earl that'll be the second on him said jerem's going to have to be more involved in this second half and he knocks down to three and now here a three-point play the oldfashioned way want to say hello to everybody looking in nationally on NBA TV tonight New Orleans Pelicans working on a season best four game winning streak Grizzlies have a four-game winning streak of their own Grizzlies had an early nine-point lead Pelicans erased it and it led by as many as 11 your early third quarter Missi again on the attack Jeremiah Robinson earl now Dejounte Murray he of the big first quarter Robinson Earl Missi extra pass deflected stolen here comes Bane downhill against Dejounte Murray flips it up and in just a second field goal for Desmond Bane tonight Chang the defense there Zach E I can move my feet Mr Knight as he gets all the way up on the screen that then forces the Pelicans into help defense and rotations not able to get it done Robinson Earl short with the three Edey the rebound you do have a way about motivating players Kennard was open for three instead it's Jaren for three it's through Jaren Jackson Jr the triple and it's a three-point game grizzley's rallying from 11 down Jaren Jackson Jr with 16 on the night nine in the quarter 33 one of them the oldfashioned way and Desmond Bane going downhill seconds let's check out cleaning the Glass Service Master by Stratus Brandon Clarke three offensive rebounds tonight missed by GG Jackson and some BC bounce Brandon Clarke with the follow slam off the GG Jackson Miss it's Brandon Clarke cleaning the glass they're going the BC to continue to clean the glass and bring that energy that he has brought here the last couple basketball games well energy and physicality that's what the Grizzlies are going to need here in the second half to try to slow down this New Orleans team that has been on an offensive role tonight 57% shooting out of the corner Robinson Earl misses that three and the rebound to Edey Robinson Earl is only a 31% three-point shooter say they were going to live with Robinson Earl being the guy that has to finish the offensive play for the Pelicans not McCollum Wells with 10 to shoot or Murray for that matter Jaren works against Robinson Earl sets up Bane shot clock down to three Dez a Euro Step a Kennard three yes Luke Kennard ties the game so right now partner Luke Kennard has it stuck on automatic five of seven from three 17 for him Trey Murphy a wide open three no rebound Edey Grizzlies a chance to claim the lead ban downhill but stumbles and lost it Robinson Earl Grizzlies need to get back defensively they don't and Murphy pays it off with the dun sometimes that line monster can jump up nice pass here look ahead to Edey Jaren Jackson Jr that's the fifth assist for Jaren tonight and it's the third assist that he is thrown to e 13-2 Run for the Grizzlies EX that they go into the to the locker room make the necessary adjustments and they come out and execute Robinson Earl hit that one you still got to play the percentages Robinson Earl is the guy taking the shots and jante Murray and CJ McCollum are not and Missi isn't rolling to the basket and finishing Trey Murphy the third is not shooting threes you live with it Kennard got Robinson Earl in the air the foul line jumper is inard with 19 trying for back-to- Back 20-point Games a season High 23 on Wednesday night against Charlotte griz's without Santi Al dama Jake laravia and johnar Z has done a great job partnering this LD with Ditch beat off the dribble there by Missi talking about three guys in Missi Edey and Wells who are in the Rookie of the Year conversation that's going to be a heated Rookie of the Year battle this year yeah there's no easy answer Kennard steps out another three good Again Luke Kennard six of eight from Beyond The Arc again oh good D here by Wells come up with a steal Bane an open three Bango grizzley's have the lead from 11 down the Jaylen Wells effect the defense forcing a turnover Bane cashing it in Murphy will try a three long two I beg your pardon rebound to Jackson Bane downhill to the cup lays it up and lays it in and now you are seeing Memphis griz's basketball which is defensive stops that lead to run outs timeout taken by New Orleans Pelicans have lost five points off of two turnovers in the period and Kennard the first time he's had consecutive 20po games since November the 29th December the 1st 2019 wow it's been a minute for Luke Kennard quar to Rally from 11th down to tie the ball or to take the lead 88 to 83 but they have done a fantastic job moving the ball and because of it they've gotten easy looks and fans you can see more of this tomorrow night Grizzlies at home against the New Orleans jazz in spirit night presented by Varsity spirit get here early the first 5,000 fans get a Grizz poster for tickets go to grizzlies.com tickets and you too can see Luke long ball in action and the long ball is in full action for Luke now he's had five streaks in his career of consecutive 20-point games the other four all happened when he was in Detroit Dejounte Murray misses the three and the rebound to Edey the extended run 237 for the Grizzlies here in in the third Edey has been huge on the defensive boards here in this third quarter works against tis Hooks and hits big fella has been fantastic here start off the quarter in the drop coverage the Pelicans got scores they changed the defense he moves up they forced him into tougher position positions and he's rebounding Mccollum with the Finish meanwhile the gries offensively are 11 for 11 here in the third pay going downhill nearly lost the dribble trying to make connections with Jaylen Wells it's out of bounds ninth Grizzly turnover of the game Bane however with 12 assists tonight 14 assist game a couple games ago and so Desmond Bane showing his playmaking abilities javante green hits that three so the the thing that's happening right now is because Edey is showing they're rolling Jaren has to stop the roller to the basket Robinson Earl got to open three and now green got an open three because of it Kennard sets up Jaren three yes and the foul a four-point chance for Jaren Jacks Jr beginning of this third quarter said they were going to need more from Jaren and Dez here in this third quarter well Jaren is about to go for his fourth three-point play of this third quarter see the shot there and the foul on green the grizzly on four-point plays this year they're two for three Jaylen Wells made one against New Orleans Scotty Pippen Jr made one against Sacramento Santi Alama missed his opportunity in Washington this is the growth that we talk about with Jaren and the reason why we continue to talk about him being an Allstar this season with how well this team has played he has only missed two games in every other game he has been integral in the point of this game Grizzly six for six from three in the period Murray straight line drive didn't get the Finish but we'll get a trip to the free throw line Brandon Clarke has come on Zach Edey is out Bane was out momentarily as well but he's back at the scores table meanwhile Jordan Hawkins who had a 15-point second quarter is about to check in for New Orleans as we check in with Rob fer you mentioned Brandon Clarke checking back in you got we're talking a lot about BC and how he's playing lately and earlier tonight Pete when you had a chance to visit with the head coach of the great Taylor Jenkins Taylor talked about BC and he said he's back to what the BC we expect to be he just makes plays he said winning plays and whatever the team needs he's steady and he's consistent and that's what he's been guys steady and consistent last three games he's averaging nine points four boards but he's 11 of 15 from the field he's got four Steals and under 20 minutes a game in those last three games this statistical foot note that was Jaren Jackson Jr's sixth career four-point play free throws down by Dejounte Murray to give him 19 meanwhile for Jaren this is a double figure period for him and Bane going to the rim he's got his double double 11 and 12 assists for Desmond Bane fourth double double of the Season bigger part in fifth and nine career double doubles for him Dejounte Murray continues to put eight of 11 for Dejounte Murray tonight that's so I don't mind when the other guys take the shots because Murray McCollum can win a game at the end of the game if the game is close Jaren leans hits 22 for Jaren Jackson Jr 15 in the period it's the eighth time he's had a double figure third quarter Murray GG Jackson with a re bound riz's a six-point lead approaching 4 minutes remaining in the third Wells his three spooned out Clarke a back tap rebound GG Jackson travels 10th Grizzlies turnover Bernard and Pitman Jr into the game for the Grizzlies Wells and Jaren Jackson J out well was important for the gries with this lineup on the floor all five guys have to be involved in rebounding but once they do then they they should be outs sprinting this Pelicans team meanwhile Jaren Jackson Jr has tied his career-high with seven assists tonight the ass the assists have been infectious Theis Hawkins ball fake shot clock down to two Dejounte Murray misses the three Theis offensive rebound Hawkins contested three air ball loose ball picked up by the Pelicans this lineup partner rebounding is going to be crucial Murphy and the foul on Brandon Clarke 13 Second Chance points for New Orleans this is a small lineup on the floor for the Grizz you already talking about Brandon Clarke is already an undiz five and he's the your only true big the floor right now Trey Murphy to the free throw line four of six tonight for him converts the three-point opportunity as you look at Vince Williams on the sidelines griz's hope to have him back sooner rather than later it's been a long rehab from the sprained ankle Clarke screens for Bane step back three off and GG Jackson lost the rebound picked up by Dejounte Murray Trey Murphy threw it clear out of bounds it was not touched by the Grizzlies it's Grizz eighth turnover for New Orleans 9895 grizzley's the advantage GG Jackson against Green Euro steps missed the bank he did everything there just couldn't get that ball to go down John conter at the scores table for the Grizzlies Murray crossing over got to the cup but good contest by Brandon Clarke forc the Miss we going a swiy on those screens comfortable with Brandon Clarke defending guards off the dribble Kennard drives dishes Clarke duns Grizzlies 30 assists on 40 baskets said they had they had a high assist ratio in the first two games and the output is better here in this game they were averaging 33 in the first two meetings Murphy and Taylor Jenkins with frustration on his face calls timeout Murphy was 169 here in the third quarter and The Grizzlies lead is three 212 remaining in the third Kennard drops off his third dime of the night these limited edition threads they're only available in FedEx romont game night and they always sell sell out buy your tickets now for Access or go to grizzlies.com one91 collabs for more information something happened with the basketball partner during that timeout Mark Lindsay came over and got the backup basketball but Justin van diamond seems that think they're just going to wipe off the the original game ball and continue to use that ball they select three at the start of every game part not I think there were I think there was some blood on the basketball ah okay someone I think someone's finger you see that yeah they're using the solu I think it's Brandon Clarke may have a bleeding hit it does have a bleeding knuckle yep so there's blood on the basketball so yep we'll get a 30 second timeout here and Katy Babcock with the head athletic trainer has already dealt with you can see Clarke and you can see the the drip down the basketball yeah with with the where the so they've deemed it okay yep done done the necessary cleanup the thing is the Grizzlies have done a great job to get themselves back into the game but the Pelicans have done a good job of not allowing the gries to run away with the game here in this third quarter Scotty Pippen Jr on the flo for the Grizz sees Alvarado on the floor for New Orleans tippen comes in the lane a no look pass sets up Bane for three Konchar Taps the rebound Clarke has it and then Theis steals it tries to deflect it off of Pippen and he is successful in doing that and New Orleans the lead New Orleans the basketball rather down three look at Willie Green fourth season with New Orleans after a couple years with the Phoenix Suns Louis green he came to this year figuring thisen we got a chance right he got to get Brandon you think he stay his start process in 8 seconds 8 second count Alvarado because there was only 22 seconds on the shot clock when they took the ball out I don't know the Pelicans realized that they took two seconds off from when the Pelicans got possession of the ball and but and ball was thrown out of bounds well to your point about Willie Green their projected lineup of McCollum Murray Zion Williamson herb Jones and Brandon Ingram have played exactly one game together ban for three that's the other thing I kept trying to Fig that that's the other big name that you don't talk a lot about herb Jones yes you can talk about all the other guys were are were their offensive guys herb Jones was their personal Defender he's we've saw him defend Ja Morant we've seen him defend Jaren Jackson Jr so losing him really hurt them on the defensive side as much as the offensive side was hurt with the other players very much so he's been dealing with a shoulder injury good portion of the season alado with a pump fake and a no look Javonte green missed the three rebound Konchar approaching one minute remaining in the third tippet Works to the Baseline Bane downhill against Green in a crowd Jaren for three rebound javante green hawk had a huge second quarter but his Pelicans Team 15 got to know where he is and know that he hunts shots Murphy drives draws a foul well that has been a a big factor for this New Orleans team in this winning streak they're averaging 28 free throws attempted per game in this four game winning streak and the foul on Brandon Clarke is his third it'll be free throws eight and nine for Murphy so it's a lot harder in today's game to reach down left a lot of I made a living on getting steals with going and attacking the basketball from another ball attacker well in today's game these guys are so good at putting the ball so low that it makes it very hard for you as a Defenders to get your hand in there and they raise their hands up as you go down to be able to pick up fouls very creative with the offensive players in today's game Murphy with 18 and he's done a good portion of his damage from the free throw line two for one opportunity here for the Grizzlies New Orleans has a foul to give Bane got downhill and flipped it up and in I think Desmond he he threw the defense off by to stumble Bane 16 points 13 assists tonight and Bane a 14 third quarter and here been awesome Alvarado and Pippen picks up the foul that's four on Scotty and second time tonight untimely foul the thing is you have to you have to know who you're guarding and so the thing the pressure of Alvarado you see Desmond Bane stumbling rumbling bumbling stumbling and because of it defensively you don't know what to do but Dez knows exactly what to do as he composes to finish for banee it's his fifth you're well third quarter of double figures and 11th quarter overall said it's a Grizz we're going to get back into this game Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr going to have to step up and both of those guys stepped up immensely here in this third both of them double figure scoring quarters Jaren with 15 in the period Bane with 14 in the period alvorado gets one more free throw Kennard and Wells back in for the Grizzlies to give them two more Shooters with 9.4 remaining in the third Alvarado a Miss it's boarded by Jaren Alvarado stole it Hawkins drives No and that'll do it for the third quarter Grizzlies will take a five-point lead into the fourth quarter well New Orleans scored 42 in the second the Grizzlies score 43 in the third hope you took the over 1051 100 Grizzlies with the advantage through three quarters on FanDuel Sports Network the second and third quarters have been pretty pretty interesting reversal of form in the second and the third quarters all right Grizzlies 26 and four with a lead through three Pelicans 3 and 28 when they Trail through three RZ up at first to start the fourth CJ McCollum back on the flooor along with BC and javante green 's got a look at a three and puts it in the rookie Zach Edey drills the triple and pushes the lead to eight and the Pelicans tried to come out in a little zone defense there not realizing that Zach Edey comfortable from the three-point line MEC McCollum green Hawkins and Alvarado for the Pelicans trying to extend their four-game winning streak and CJ McCollum laces that three his third of the game 20 for CJ McCollum he averages 222 what makes him so good is how he can run so fast to get open but then compose himself get his legs under him for jumping Jaren Jackson Jr his fifth triple of the game 25 for Jaren Jackson Jr Grizzlies open the fourth with Wells Jackson Edie Kennard and John Konchar Allstar Jaren Jackson Jr showing up here in his second half see if the coaches around the league agree McCollum draws a foul from Jaylen Wells number J Dam wow o wow see if the Grizzlies not sure if they're going to challenge this or not but I think if Jaylen Well's face yes is taking an absolute beating this year an absolute beating no challenge for the Grizzlies and McCollum will shoot three he's five of six from the line tonight's my bud my old buddy WS letting him know that ball don't lie there's one constant in this game is that basketball you you made the point about jayen Wells he got beat up in the Charlotte game trying to fight through screens fighting through screens fighting through lamelo ball just as he's putting his hands up as if I'm trying to go through I'm going to keep taking a couple shots at you as I'm going through this the nature of the game we all have done it when somebody gets into your grill certain ways that you get them off without being overt and doing it Jay R because he stays into his play two miss two out of three there for the wow we talked about it earlier about colum just 71% from the free throw line on the season dribble hand off Kennard got Alvarado in the air hit the leaner grizz's wondering why there wasn't a call there Taylor Jenkins hoping for some consistency at least to his way of thinking alado a catch and shoot three puts it in Luke Kennard a season High 24 tonight after 23 on Wednesday against Charlotte he'll try it for three Bango holy cow Luke Kennard unconscious the seven of nine from downtown this you said you calling cool hand I'm calling him old school this is old school Luke Kennard here and out of bounds by Hawkins Jordan Hawkins steps out of bounds rizes have match their largest lead of the night and the amount of off the dribble shots that we have seen tonight from Luke Kennard let you know how good he's feeling and you made the point earlier in the broadcast there were times Kennard would pump fake pump fake and he was almost reticent to shoot this is an aggressive Luke Kennard that we haven't seen really look at this now a long two it's a good look though I'm I'm telling we have we have not seen this at all from Luke Kennard in terms of the off the dribble good call there to foul Z eeden McCollum will get two more at the line foul on there will be this a huge discrepancy at the end of this game in the free throws yes and this will be one of the few games where we have a discrepancy where you and I are not fuming over here with the type of calls that were made this is not an indictment on any official in this game here today and CJ Mccollum continues to do the grizz's a favor yeah it after this second free throw by McCollum the free throw attempts will be 30 to5 get upset about yep no Cruz done a good job Mark Lind he's a really good Pro Jaren backing down leans hooks hits that should have been an AM yeah that that that that's why Taylor Jenkins is mad about the foul disparity well the thing is you you can't fault me for being bigger than the other player if that's who they want to defend him with McCollum doubled green a corner three no rebound Kennard he's everywhere we said play the percentages which right you want green and Robinson Earl to be the guys finishing offensive plays not the other players Kennard crossing over dump down Edey had it knocked away goes to the floor to save The Possession Corner three Wells knocked out of bounds Zach Edey the first to the floor the biggest man on the floor is the first to the floor for the loose ball you see here the ball gets knocked away the pans think they got it nuh-uh Zach Edey says I'm going to be the first to get it saving a possession for the Grizzlies that's a 74 layout Kennard for the Grizzlies ran a gorgeous out of bounds play and then a look ahead to Trey Murphy who lays it in and Kennard missing at The Point Blank Range I think Luke thought he got some contact from the back Jaren drives sweeping hook no rebound Murphy Murphy Retreats his three well off and the rebound filtering out to conchar Edey another three try that one will off Alvarado pass through the hands of Missi Kennard great pass to Konchar for the Finish Luke Kennard is sixth assist of the game the Grizzlies 34 helpers on the night the lead back to 10 matching the team's largest timeout Pelicans I think Luke Kennard is trying to go for three in a row with these interviews with Rob Fischer he's enjoying it he has been a joy to watch former their 17 and five let's talk a little Zach Edey tonight his fifth double double of the season 13 points 10 rebounds couple of blocks couple of steals three assists I mean he's filled out the stat line tonight well I thought Zach was impactful in this basketball game using his size using his physicality on both ends of the floor the defensive rebounds were HED the change in defense for him to be up and show on those screens and trap at time was fantastic we say that he just he does not have to be an allar on the floor for this team but he can impact the game and he's imp acted the game here in the second half jante Murray has it good show by Zach Edey forcing Murray out to the half court line Trey Murphy drives and puts it in against the shot clock Murphy with 20 your part could be 22 and four here in the period the Pelicans are going small Trey Murphy trying to stop Jaren no chance jaren two at the free throw line coming for him and and offensively if you ever getting a tough spot you just throw the ball at Jaren forc the Pelicans to have to trap there's no way that they can allow Trey Murphy the thir to play Jaren one onone and Jackson with seven assists talking with the Grizzlies coaching staff before the game they feel the next step in the Jaren Jackson evolution is to be a great passer because he is going to see double and triple teams so can you read the other chess pieces on the board and make the right play at the right time if you're not going to go to the rim yourself here's the reality partner he's never had to do it before so that's why you say what's the next step the the first step was to get to where he was Ultra aggressive to making those moves and last season because of the injuries because he was thrust into that role he's doing it more this year so the next thing is yes the double teams will come and he's on defying players Hawkins three ball is off boarded by Konchar Bane looking to go downhill he Scoops he scores and Desmond Bane has been dynamite in the second half downhill Dez a subtlety there Zach Edey holding off the next Defender allowing Dez to get the late Bane seven of nine from the floor here in the second half after a one for six start that start was for he and jaren that first half neither got it going Alvarado trying to turn the corner and an offensive foul and CJ McCollum at the scores table see Desmond Bane you see Zach Edey there doesn't allow Trey Murphy the third to help in any way and Desmond Bane able to get the flip to go down there here's the hook Alvarado the 12th turnover on New Orleans grizzy's score they they are plus one in the points off turnover category so far Pippen shot clock at 10 for Bane works with the Jaren Jackson Jor screen feeds to Pippen threes too strong Edey offensive rebound Edey out of the double b Pippen in the lane a 360 spin and a make for Scotty Pippen Jr Pippen with 10 Off the Bench we talked about Edey's impact the offensive rebound allows Scotty Pippen Jr the double figure scoring for tonight grizzli nine second chance points McCollum trying to work himself free from Jaren Jackson Jr Murray on the feed McCollum flips it's long it's boarded by Konchar but then it's wrestled Away by McCollum but CJ McCollum is called for the foul 545 remaining here in the for he Ser Scotty PIppen Jr to the basket reverse spin able to get that one to go down and by making that the gries now six guys and double figures and jayen well sitting on eight himself for the five starters in double figures plus Jackson GG Jackson and pimping Off the Bench Bane drives on Hawkins off the glass Brandon Clarke to follow BC has been special again here tonight eight and six boards for Brandon Clarke Grizzlies their largest lead 128 112 and a foul on Brandon Clarke tell the other reason why how we know that is Brandon Clarke is back and feeling good about himself VC walks on his toes a lot and so when he is on those toes the majority of the time on the floor when he first came back it was a lot of on his heels there's no more on his heels they're not worrying about that Achilles at all and being effective for this team he's playing with full confidence right now McCollum that's not Away by Konchar it's going to stay with New Orleans Six on the shot clock Grizzlies is going to call a timeout here and the Grizzlies are going to challenge the Grizzlies are going to challenge us you want to know who's in the caucus tonight we'll tell them when we come back okay we'll do that but we it's a tease it's a tease yeah it's a tease the people at home don't turn the channel something good challenging this he's up 128 to 112 our International Paper player of the game Luke Kennard second player in franchise history with seven or more three-pointers made in two consecutive games the other guy would be some guy Mike Miller have you heard of him I I mean that's my one-on-one partner I used to kick his butt too sometimes but the thing is we like about Luke can we he has been terrific and is the shooting of the basketball so many times it is usually somebody driving and kicking to Luke well tonight cooland Luke was knocking down shots off the dribble himself and because of it he is our International Paper player the game which I have to give a little honorable mention also to Jaren and Dez right now approximate foul that's a new rule this year Brandon Clarke caught McCollum on the wrist so the Grizzlies were correct on the out of bounds but it's a fifth foul on Brandon Clarke who guards Dejounte Murray he's still hungry yes uh you want to know who's in the replay center tonight yeah I want to know who's having red beans and rice and and duli sausage Sean Corbin and Mark Davis oh they love that they they're they're they are they're down with that oh they're waiting Pippen drives against McCollum yes and the foul foul on CJ McCollum is third and Pippen Brevin he has struggled Off the Bench he's flourished as a starter but he has really played a solid game tonight a dozen and two steals uh uh thought he's been decisive on his drive to the basket and when he's made his drive to the basket it wasn't to jump in the air and figure out what I'm going to do it was I'm if I'm jumping the lead is 17 largest for the Grizzlies 28o turnaround here in the second half CJ McCollum backs up misses a three VC offensive rebound foul conar when New Orleans gets their roster right and everybody healthy Missi is going to be a huge huge benefit to this New Orleans team in Willie Green because they they they were still going to need someone to man the middle for this basketball team and and it's nice to have a young player that you can continue to build and grow around because you know Zion you would hope that there would be some consistency to his play as his career goes along you don't want to put him alongside or put him in the middle as your Center you would like for him to stay in that forward position you allow me to be a roller player and then he can be a guy that roams on the floor and can attack the basket when he wants to right and then you got herb Jones also defending on the perimeter so I mean you're well stocked defensively yeah and Herb Jones done a better job shooting a three ball for them also Bane a mid-range jumper no tipped in by Clarke Brandon Clarke working the offensive glass again seven and double figures intercepted GG Jackson Pippen thought about the corner three goes at McCollum can't get him in the air BC no rebound through the hands of Konchar Murray a straightway three Dejounte Murray 26 on the night and that's his first three-point make of the game his offense is not predicated on the three-point line it is so much of his predicate on getting into that mid-range area Brandon Clarke Gigi wheels in the lane Clarke shot clock down to five pippet step back three going to be way off fored by Clarke beat the shot clock GG Jackson offensive rebound he misses Pippen misses Konchar an offensive rebound under three remaining the aggressiveness the Grizz there getting multiple possessions Bane a Euro Step GG wants a three PIppen offensive rebound finds badee Taylor Jenkins the strong reaction the Grizzlies dominating that possession on the offensive glass the Grizzy 16 offensive rebounds tonight and they pay it off to go up 135 118 this a massive effort by this Grizzlies team on this last possession yeah five shots at it before Desmond Bane is able to get the laying off of Scotty Pippen's drop off and nobody more excited about that possession than Taylor Jenkins on the sideline that might have been the most demonstrative I've seen him in quite a while Desmond bane just another 20-point game for Dez that's 11 to the last 12 and toss in 14 assists tying his season high and another 14 assist game for Desmond bangs seven in a row with a 20 plus and the thing for Dez right now when we're we are witnessing is the 20po games are coming and you look up and say oh he has 20 again that's because he is just letting the game come to him there aren't four situations there are a couple of downhill opportunities where he lost his footing but other than that Desmond Baye has been in control of himself in this game especially here in the second half meanwhile the Grizzlies this is their 15th game with seven or more players in double figures and now 10 different Grizzlies players have scored 300 points that's most in the NBA Kennard needed just six got 27 tonight well it has been by committee by this grizzly team and so many teams have had injuries they this grizzly team had injuries but I give give credit to the depth of this roster that they have been able to win games but they're winning games playing basketball the right way and Willie Green knows his team has another game tomorrow night against Charlotte griz's also in action tomorrow they'll take on Utah and so Willie Green is gone to the bench alado the Miss out of bounds it stays with New Orleans we get our first look at Carlo metovic and Jamal Kane in for the first time tonight along with Alvarado Hawkins and Jeremiah Robinson Earl Jaylen wells in Bane out of the game presumably done for the night 20 and 14 Hawkins if if he if he touches he's launching oh it's going up listen he had 15 in that second quarter the Griz have done a good job only two for him here in this second half two minutes remaining Pippen drives sets up Wells Wells Clarke yes hammer nail coffin this Baby's over the Grizzlies up 17 with a minute 47 remaining the Grizzlies overcoming an 11-point deficit from early in the third quarter and they have dominated here in the second half Alvarado a step back three dominated you are exactly right partner and and defensively they got stop that they needed to get but it was just an
