 game under the 500 Mark and in conference play they're also a game under the 500 Mark at 16 and 17 going over some of the tiebreakers and we'll get into that a little bit later now the match Up's going into the game and Jonas is going to be coming off the bench for Sacramento Jose with the start and welld deserved with CJ Murphy Zion and Yves going up against Malik monk Zach LaVine what a score what a talent demar Derozan his teammate in Chicago along with Keegan Murray manad sabonis the happiest guy in the world to get Jonas out of the opposition and in his own locker room now ads Keys all brought to you by your local Toyota dealers ad we got two keys today Joe you see him right here first his attention to detail this is a team that does a lot of dribble handoffs a lot of movement you have to do the little things well second you have to keep Jonas and sabonis off the offensive glass pretty simple pretty simple today detail right detail be detailed defensively do the little things well and again you have to match the physicality of Jonas Valanciunas and also Domantas sabonis yeah and remember the pals played really well in the last game in Denver one quarter it got away 36 of the 48 minutes great Energy Great execution but the turnovers cropped up in the third but they got away from them CJ over Murray and Zion on the follow Second Chance points and Omen to begin the game and here's the thing Zion or Yves should Feast on this offensive class cuz they only have one big right they're basically playing four out four Smalls and one big on the Run Jose takes it away from Keegan Murray but Murray gets it right back on the deflection it'll be sa bonis and it's all even so it looked like it was a takeway for the pal unfortunately it went the other way Jose coming up the high screen by Yves good to see Jose out there in a starting assignment he to be Zion how about a little midy he'll try to pop through it was blocked away K Murray the secondary Defender sabon is on the Run he's got Malik monk had a good box out all the way around for re to pick it up 90 seconds in deep one Murphy gets the triple you already know what it is Joe he's picking up right where he's left off for the last 25 games Murphy has been amazing and what he has done we'll get into it a career high four straight games with 25 or more it's his 11 25-point game this season there's a lot of good numbers good things to talk about when it comes to Murphy sabonis comes up short two minutes gone by PS have really controlled this series until they finally got a win and that's Sacramento in the first match up the season series 10 on the shot clock Zion battling inside loses the handle kept it alive though and CJ knows the clock is down sets it up catch and shoot Jose that's a great play by CJ Mccollum not bailing out this Sacramento defense by just launching a 30-footer but putting his head down collapsing that defense and give Jose Alvarado nice efficient three-point shot the runner Malik monk very short Zion gets it out in a hurry good start for the PS couple of triples early and quick touches in the half court set as well Jose runs the set so the pel have started three for five two for two for beam AR now shot is all the way down get to the set it'll be Zion he knows the clock is down for the little midi he can get that anytime he wants to and the back pedaling on right they're backpedaling to try and meet him at The Rim that midi has been open and it's nice to see him shoot this shot with a little more regularity it'll be sabon saw on the Finish he went down to get that pass nice bounce entry by Malik monk six-point game they come in as one of the higher scoring teams in the NBA in fact eighth best at 116 a game Zion gets the switch he wanted and on the spin he's fouled by Keegan Murray after zonis to trade when when Zion is patient when he gets two feet below that foul line it it lights out speaking to patience Joel take your time here the shot clock's winding down that's simple penetrating pitch simple offense at the end of the shot clock and you can see sabonis is trying to back up cuz he's anticipating contact sometimes don't give him what they want be raised up and I like what you said about CJ cuz the vet looked at the clock there were six on the shot clock and he wasn't going to settle and a drive and a kick and it was a great look you saw how much space Jose j a little flat with the first free throw good to have you with us on the Golf Coast Sports and Entertainment Network and this one of the better buildings in the NBA it is also on Fox8 back home tonight so we appreciate that as well in a seven-point lead for the pals but this is the only game in town and they are very passionate if you remember the old days Cowbell Kingdom Arena yep when they were banging pop Bells at our ear we were broadcasting the knees they felt like the knees of the the first row we're our back five of the shot clock for sabonis fake to handoff and blocked Away by E and and if you see this last defensive possession the attention and detail was there they're switching but to switch you have to make sure you're making contact that forces sabonis to put his head down and play one-on-one with Yves now protect the rim on the inbound series with only 1.8 on the shot clock Zach LaVine on the Fly by he's short Murray's there they're involved Their audience it Zion all the way to the C Jo they cannot hold him what a start for Zion with seven early points on three of four from the field it'll be saved by Lavine and a good look for Demar de Roan that is not his specialty he'll take it more often and h Zion fin Joe we talked about this in Denver I'll say what I said at the first game in Denver when Zion comes out and he's aggressive offensively what it does for the confidence and flow of this Pelicans offense serious start for the pals six of eight from the field and an early nine-point Advantage it starts with Zion they went over this and shoot around fighting through the screen with Demar Derozan look at the weak side of the floor Jose Murphy and CJ switching on contact right Jose fighting over top of the screen and then denying Keegan Murray the basketball everybody stay home fight Keegan Murray over top when you do things the right way it forces now sabonis to go one-on-one that's attention to detail as far as communication is concerned pressure already in the back court for the PS are you okay your voice has not changed has it they were hitting tennis balls and my partner took one for the team I did take one to the team they they goingon to have me here singing like Philip Bailey the reasons that's Earth Wind and Fire is one of my alltime favorites please that did not feel good Joe you supposed to have my back though you know what I saw it happen tears came to my eyes from laughter shot CL tears came to my eyes too from painon he can make that comes up short this time though javante gets it out so javante in there for Zion only chain so far for the pels now what a start little two-man game and Yves couldn't get the Finish nice Bounce by Jose caught him in Rhythm defended well Yves gets another block Yves had a great read on that catch and shoot time how about the start for the pels tonight up by a dozen he's done a fantastic job thus far at using that size that length and that athleticism at meeting different Kings at the Apex now mon off off the pick Murray on the pop and going to be Yves keeping it away from sabonis should the pals are seven of 10 they haven't missed from Beyond The Arc Murphy he's sharing it Jose he's got a path against LaVine who touches multiple changing sides 30 foot why not yes Bop four for four as a group Murphy's got his second triple L's by 15 Joe you know how deep that is that's 30 easy man is 30 easy and again that's deep for somebody else not him is look at 's doing what a way to protect the rim sabonis complaining beautiful ball mve y lot of touches Jose on the take how about to reverse he it to CJ they got this Ste back another got it they got this defense all over the place 18-point Advantage they got this defense this Sacramento Kings defense in constant Chase mode and and what about the energy again the way we saw it because remember they had 78 points in the first half in Denver what a start it'll be the mid-range of Monk sabonis after it gang rebounding good job by Yves got help they kept it away from sabonis what a beginning keep moving the ball 12 overall CJ weights and how about a floater he wanted to give it back he will Yves couldn't get the reverse though boy that's sharing the basketball the CJ could have taken the runner twoo now sabonis Jose deflex got to bring it back out that's how intense the D has been bin told you sabonis gets the triple you had to say f yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry it's out of five 15 Point Fell's lead Carlo matovich about to check in started the last game in Denver and looked good had nine boards in that game the pick Jose the pop another coming up short and Zach LaVine has it what an acquisition a guy who has one slam D contest who can hit threes with a click of the wrist got to stay down got to stay javante he poked it away you got space Jose in the corner but it's going to be a foul on the floor it'll come in on the side I think will he thought it was a gather yeah we talk about javon's ability to defend multiple positions this is what you're going to get from Bruce Brown as well right you have in today's NBA you have to be able to to be able to guard sometimes one through five Javonte does a great job in sometimes being undersized at getting his hands on a lot of basketball he gets a lot of deflections hawks into the game so is carlo3 CJ stay is on the floor plenty of time of the shot clock on the inbound series CJ feeling it a little bit strong man picked up by Zach LaVine at a foul Onre it was a 50/50 tough break a good foul that's a good foul because it was transition and they had of the floor space yeah the floor was definitely out of balance Murphy by the way comes into the game seventh in the league now in three-point percentage and by the way he's got the ninth longest streak in NBA history for hitting multiple threes in 33 consecutive games that's all that's it that's all that's it eight minutes it's in and the pels off to a really good start they bring in Keon Ellis and he's had moments against the pels before I mentioned that to you before CJ takes it away Murray relaxed can he burn him what a pass off the window CJ to tr okay CJ M man oh my goodness gracious Jo classic the whole bench is exploded here's the thing Joe look at our Energy power play watch CJ CJ take a look over his shoulder knew what was going Lord have mercy go get it Murphy go get it that's when you're having a lot of fun as a group when you put it off the window like that you are feeling better after taking a tennis ball it's good to know you're back sabonis with bur it's not the guy to leave no and way strong two Pels there Murphy picks up the board yo that was I I I say it all the time man what a pass Murphy can win the dunk contest and the Three-Point Shootout in the same night then why isn't he in the the shoot uh three-point shooter come on can't believe it CJ good way to switch sides and another on the dime saw his teammate you said that like I pick the shooters I don't have a vote with you and thrown away by sabonis you know what you love about this first quarter obviously the defense holding a team Sacramento Kings that's averaging 116 points to nine points in this quarter thus far but the ball movement offensively changing sides of the floor with the basketball and forcing the Sacramento Kings team to guard the entire with of the floor all right Darth Raiders into the game you heard me oh yeah John Wick something it'll be Murphy on the handoff and popped away laravia he just got here and he gets points off a takeaway so Jake laravia coming over one of the transactions from 18-point game CJ saw GRE javante Corner three coming up short the lake monk picks it up now three minutes to play it'll be laravia oh really I know he called glass he called glass 15 boy game it's a long game and he's bought a spark Off the Bench for them quickly quick five points now CJ got him on his back and blocked Away by Arabia from behind it belongs to Sacramento you said it he's given them energy brought the count Crow into the game too but still a brilliant beginning for the pal and I say moments cuz the P are six of nine for beyond the rcd and the thing is it's not to six and n look at how they're coming though right they're coming with ball movement they're coming with multiple passes these are not contested three-point shots right and this is when the team is a best version of thes themselves you're switching sides of the floor with the basketball and every time down with ball movement and Multiple Man movement you're compromising the Sacramento Kings defense eight assists for the PS on the first 11 makes to your point of moving and at multiple touches all right out of the timeout Sacramento's got it Lyles comes into the game veteran forward out of Kentucky now in his 10th year after he started his career back in 2015 with Utah you would you would you would expect him to that's too easy that's way too easy you can't L yeah what Brandon Boston did he tried to teat the play you can't cheat the play you have to lock in L you have to lock in trail get on his hit pocket Zion back on the floor with Hawkins mid-range Hawkins too strong strong and Jas pulls it away the Ria single Manley has brought the energy back in this building and they tried to get it to him right they tried to get it to him Brandon Boston loes the handle and unforced Air in tennis terminology Seattle 13-point lead for the BS you're going to you would expect them to go in the Jonas he's matched up with Carlo yeah this is what you would expect to take advantage of his size and he he gave it up he didn't give it up right he didn't want to give it up double netive triple it goes from a 20po lead B are dve spell if don't forget it was 29 to9 Zion up against his ex- teammate and how about thatp when with all due respect the Jonas Valanciunas when Zion sees Jonas on him his eyes should light up he's got 11 points already monk into the teeth of the defense for Yas well see he's got 25 or more in four of his last five games really putting Jonas on on Zion CCH it up for Haw real short line drrive and it was already out of bounds I thought it was popped out of bounds on the Baseline Malik monk Waits he'll take it himself and it's an air ball javante with Brandon Boston out there Hawk catching shoe better look at least off his hand it look better and 28.6 pel's had a foul to give so it'll come in in the side I thought it bounced the ball out of Bounce right there and it was okay maybe they got reservations but there's plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood you can always get one final 20 seconds of a really good start for the pels up by 10 got about a 4 and 1/2 second differential Ellis get the triple that's a good read by Malik monk right with no D’Aaron fox now a lot of the ball handling decision making is going to be on the league mon show Brandon Boston maintains he only got five left in the quarter three at the buzzer and that'll do it so you didn't end the quarter the way you started it and not a lot of touches in the last couple of minutes Su Zion real hot first pal in double figures trays up there along with CJ and at the end of the first pells by seven state capital of Sacramento and a good start for the PS up by as many as 20 it's our FanDuel Live points total as the pels went up by 20 second unit though really jump things up as the pels are in the zone now and here's the thing Joel this this second unit of the pelic without CJ Mccollum without Jose Alvarado without Murphy you have to continue with the ball movement right you have to continue to move this basketball well and 17 of the 26 points for Sacramento are from their bench and I bring it up because their bench is 29th in the league well the B changed now though I know but averaging 25 a game so laravia comes in Li just got it he has and what Zion's saying is you can see it from here yep Jones has his right arm around Zion's waist and if you he wants to use a challenge here yeah you can see it from here yeah then it'll be a foul right and you're trying to clear out you got to be ready to shoot this basketball right good set up Brandon Boston from Zion gets a triple this is why it's it's weird to see duck Christie put Jonas on Zion because Zion can do this all night right here penetrate survey the floor and simply make the right read foul on Brandon Boston away from the ball it'll come in on the side look at look at how much space he has right look where larab is there's no one you can't do both you can't build a wall on D and then get back peler now seven of 13 that's the reason behind the EO lead seven of 13 in their triples ly going to be short Boston gets it barely kept it away find number one Brandon Austin on the run and he draws the contact gets the foul it'll be on Keon Ellis and a break because there was a lot of traffic underneath so an eight-point game Brandon Boston just hit the triple now goes with the free throw the line pells are going deep into the bench Antonio RYvess out there so four the five on the floor right now for the pells from the second unit as Boston gets the first of two well don't forget about your chance to win a carnival celebration from all of us the match up of Sacramento back home on the 12th it's a bip prize back all presented by Ashner heal two lower Vol tet City Edition jerseys and passes to an exclusive marade experience go to pelicans.com win stand or pelicans.com SL win all I know is I am working my way up to the baby cwl race I'm I'm really kind of worried about you you know andri handicapping it is now as I was watching the fairgrounds today monk with Ellis in the backourt for Sacramento Jonas good hands by Zion great Hands by Zion it's going the other way cuz caros is going to take the brunt of it right but then yeah the thing is Zion came from where Jonas couldn't see him got to get out the way Carlo let this man work right going to spin to a strong side doesn't get it it and go I'm telling you Joe there is literally nothing that Jonas Valanciunas can do right this is probably one of the toughest matchups for Jonas as far as his ability to move his feet are concerned put a Pucket on the board Z's got 13 now yep man easy call Lyles and tapped it one of was on the rim Ellis he was held up they wanted a foul and the line Drive can Hawk hold on it'll belong to the bells tapped Away by laravia just about two minutes gone in the second quarter you're going to get hit you know that with a run and how do you respond with a run so the pells are back up by double figures Zion shares it Brandon Boston another clean look triple again it's not a the offense becomes more simple when by D Christie putting Jah valun is on Zion because now you can give him the ball and simply space the flooor and guess what Zion on the tap on the finish and a timeout for Doug Christy as Z's up to 15 and impacting it on both ends of the floor I tell you that young man is such a Difference Maker Joel he is such a Difference Maker I don't even know if Zion Williamson realizes how much Zion Williamson makes a difference the Ste and the Finish incredible here is approach all brought you by New Balance you you have to be able on the road to set the tone it starts with your stars right Zion did a great job even though he's on a minutes restriction at making sure the pals got off to a great start offensively not simply by scoring the basketball Joe but also by collapsing this Sacramento defense and finding his teammates you know you and I were talking about it he he's been to the free throw line once one of two at the strip with 15 points but right now with six to play in New York jaym Brun has 13 free throw attempts in a Lakers win today Austin RYvess had 13 free throw attempts I'm looking forward to the day when Zion gets that me too but we know how this works right when you're bigger and stronger you're you're officiated a little bit differently Good Deed you said it Arabia caught up in the air don't go there Zion goes to the line looking for the three-point play going 100 milph eight and N from the field man eight and N from the field and he has played downhill this entire game right again on on the rotation seeing it in advance and now we know how this works when he gets the head down he it's game over Joel how about that g g goes to the line you know what I'm not messing with you today I am not messing with you you can't convert another the three-point play so it stays at 17 for Zion he comes in averaging 23 in 28 minutes a game not too shabby and this going to be an adjustment for the Sacramento team offense without D’Aaron Fox it's going to take a minute LaVine gave up the dribble Ellis tried to find space and he got it Hawk he got him into the air and Jordan's got the foul so went down don't forget it was 3124 at the end of the first quarter it was a roller coaster ride first 6 minutes last 6 minutes of the first 12 and now the pels have pushed it back up to 18 with a lot of time left in the half they pushed it back up to 18 when things started to it looked like Sacramento was getting back into this game because of Zion's shoulders it's really a shame you don't need me anymore Ellis misses two now our chemistry our chemistry right now is in an alltime high Joe Zion on the dribble hand off Randon Boston he beats laravia for the midi and pops out so simonis gets him up in a hurry Zach LaVine follow the way and that'll be going I like what Carlos trying to do though trying to protect it trying to protect that Rim yep and he had a block don't forget on jic last game same way is that's a great he jumped off one foot too he got up there he did important stretch for the bench Zion the only starter out there right now and off the glass Carlo after it keeps it alive Second Chance Antonio ree want to go back that corner brand and Boston and it'll be a kick by Boston another turnover so it stays at 16 fourth turnover on the palace compared to eight so far on Sacramento Murray BR it to Derozan back into the game along with sabonis as well as Keegan Murray so now four their five starters on the floor and the fifth is Keon Ellis looking for and they'll get sabonis on the bounds and and that's a very very difficult play to guard because it's an empty side picking row you have the shooter and Keegan Murray over there so you got to pick your poison Zion sets it up beautifully Boston gets another triple and all Brandon Boston has to do is just be shot ready right right because Zion is doing a fantastic job at collapsing their defense 9 of 15 on the threes for the BS it'll be a foul on Brandon Boston as the roosen tried to back him down it should come in on the side third foul on the PS and for Brandon Boston it's going to be his second foul he leaves with actually stays on the floor Zion sits down you can't really see from this angle how much attention that they're paying to Zion but that is a uncontested three-point shot for Brandon Boston and that's why the pals are shooting 60% from Beyond The Arc LaVine with sabonis deflected shot clock down got to know he's coming back to that shoulder you mean when he travels you have to know he's coming back to that shoulder s and a half to play sabonis he's really talented once he gets inside the paint now you have to find a way to generate some offense without Zion in the game and you want this ball to continue to move from side to side though Antonio RYvess good set up Carlo on the Finish RYvess on the penetration I see you Huggy I see you Huggy RYvess five gone that happened in a hurry it was Zach LaVine after a mate 15-point game Zach LaVine with a second bucket he's only taking three shots Murphy had some space going to wait a minute 17 you got to get back and build a wall on Zach Lavine and that's twice now yeah but the thing is he is a professional score we talk about this with CJ Mccollum he's long he's athletic and he can finish at The Rim Yves about to check back into of the game Murphy got him on his back never a great pass by Murphy yep found his teammate and the little mid is going to be short for Hawk got to stop the basketball you know he wants to go left ah and he'll go left yes he does you have to have a beat on that if he beats you going the other way you got to live with him right and and car you can see Carlos Gass he's gassed he's getting run that he has not seen before it's Aria drive to the paint how about the pocket pass a great pocket pass and a better finish man great pocket pass by Murphy and by the way you know Carlos now getting some reps and it's only going to get better for all of us cuz he's growing in confidence right and he's growing in confidence in his athleticism right you sometimes you don't really know how to use it yet right right and it's a drastic difference between balling out in the G league and transferring and translating that same confidence over to the NBA level sabon is now with a dozen to go along with six boards I tell you I love Carlos motor I love his motor he's got a good attitude yes he does really good attitude and coachable you see that now Murphy on the hand off pounded by Murray set a pick and it's going to be a walk turnover is the fifth of the game indecision cost him that time the thing is if you're in any screening action with Murphy pistol action screen and row action he's going to attach two to him right he's receiving that type of attention now so you have to be prepared for it when that ball comes out CJ's in Jose not back yet then will'll be the starting back court in there and four the five starters will be on the floor for the PS luine the always dangerous you called him a fro score he just he can do anything out score yep and out of out of bounds on the sideline that is going to be their ninth turnover already so Sacramento comes into the game and remember Dior and fox was here running their sets they fifth fewest turnovers in the NBA 13 a contest they've got nine already and it's an adjustment right because you're asking a guy who's not a traditional point guard whether it's Keon Ellis or Malik monk to now generate and run your offense yeah they were hot as Jose finds Murphy who's held go for it he will yeah and that's through contact playing through Murray grabbing him from behind and Murphy has gotten so much more comfortable at just doing that Joel playing through contact jabones that was a walk in front of all of us including Willie Green and it turns into a three that hurts 13-point game M has been good for them off the bench he's got six he's only taken two shots good catch by CJ see this what I'm talking about right here knocks it out of Bound Again look at the attention that teams are giving to Murphy now right when you go back to back games with 41 and then three game stretch average 37 38 points a game anytime he has two you have to be prepared to make a play out of the gravity that he's attracting yeah and he's also don't forget he's adjusted he career best nine assists last game for Murphy now short shot clock six on the clock Murphy again going to the rack and wow man he got hit Keon Ellis the other way that that's what kind of gets you right what what kind of gets you look I'm not going to sit here and talk about the officiating that that's irrelevant Murphy talking about it right but it it's the the and that's what willly is telling the official right now right you let one go at one end and then call a really soft one on the other end so you let this one go right you let this one go right here and it's like okay let's play ball and now what you're assuming is that it's going to be consistent and then Keon Ellis receives the benefit of that whistle yeah Murphy in traffic as the other end it's touch inside of five left in the half and how do you close the half now our Louisiana Lottery Power ball update we almost home almost there for 133 million strong got him right where we want them I know cuz you told me you got a plan I can't wait till we get back I can't wait till we get back to I got a new put this into action I got a new system it's like playing bingo it's down to 11 CJ he wants to find Murphy now your way out with call the foul on Murray on the shove Murray was just a beat behind but he was trying to get up and deny that swing pass to CJ Mccollum he was just a step behind yeah they've got a foul to give still and the PS are out of fouls with a lot of time left in the half Yves and points off a turnover we'll see leers a bonus that's a great job by Yves got back into the play didn't he now CJ with the floor is SPAC Jose bouncing around catch and shoot Murphy oh my God was had a tough shot in and out of his hands in a hurry and honestly that easily could have been a four-point play four-point opportunity TS up to 13 on 506 he's three of three from Beyond The Arc I'm going to continue to say this Jo we are watching a star being born in number 25 this is the hill I'm willing to die on Jose's got it PS by 14 yeah why not 30 ft away just off now oh man yeah it's off Keon Ellis bring it in in a hurry and is it going to be a challenge yeah they're going to challenge it now he's yeah you can't change it now he's trying to change it to a timeout he's trying to change to a timeout because Jose actually told them he was looking at Sacramento bench he said go ahead and challenge Jose's on a classic we know that much tell and why I say A Star is being born this is beautiful offense penetrating pitch by CJ Mccollum excellent job of Murphy relocating look how deep that shot is though and hits nothing but the bottom of the net and that was challenged well at the end if not contact at the end so Murphy who has been hard to believe and you see what he's done his three-point percentage the best against any opponent is right here against the Sacramento Kings and one of the reasons the bells have come into the series over the last three seasons with Sacramento so out of the timeout Murphy up against Zach line CJ needs help Zion back on the floor Murphy held up that's a will get to the rim he gets it real difficult finish you give Sacramento Credit cuz they did a great job at coming out and denying a lot of options right there for the Pelicans Murray over the smaller man good read by Murray he realized what he could do with it so 3 minutes to play and a really good start for the Pals tonight Zion lost the handle and it's going the other way that'll be the seventh turnover on the PS 10 so far on Sacramento oh nice Jose Jose's there he's got Murphy beats a bonus sets it up the guy who stole it can't get that one Ellis will pick it up but what a play by Jose Zach LaVine man a kick so 14 in the shot clock off e so the bells have their starting five out there to close the half with 233 to play and how do they close the half up by 12 we talk about this almost every game je right the closing quarters and closing halves and just how important that is you don't want going to undo all you've done in his half by playing a poor 2 minutes and 30 seconds and now Sacramento has their starters back on the floor long rebound Derozan will track it down and Murray gets the Finish he's a long small forward CJ going to float him leaves it you have to shoot this basketball you got it he tried to and LaVine can't get it Murphy's got it now the floor is SPAC you have the man advantage Yves you can't turn it over two minutes to play you're playing their game which is pickup right now that hurts Demar Derozan he'll wait I'm going tell you what coaches used to tell us all the time as opposed to putting the big in that situation shoot the basketball and trust him to offensive rebound e gets the board these are tough catches for some of these big in in such Close Quarters right Zion On The Move Jose Y relocating Murphy on the reverse wow the handle beautiful Murphy is up to 15 Z's got 17 the handle and the strength to finish around that Rim B still shooting 55% Derozan and is's going to the free throw line Zion wishes he got that so A couple of free throws and and they still have a foul to give in the final minute 18 Demar Derozan and what a career he has had playing for Coach Floyd at USC now in his 16th season all those good years with Toronto here the thing he's a professional scorer too right they have two guys you can give 25 a night easily here gets the first of two group packages group nights special occasions come on and join us the packages you can create your own custom ticket packages food beverage unique experiences go to the special group events on pelicans.com slgr groups pelicans.com slgr groups pels by 11 and they have dictated the tempo since the beginning of this game you join us a little bit late Yves good take and sabonis with the foul but Yves washed was it Yves or Murphy who flashed through I'm blocked out by Doug Christie and it looked like it was Yves who flashed through and created that space for Zion to take it and that's the thing sometimes movement is just good because you make someone else account for you and then he had the space to attack sabonis it's easy to stand and watch Su Zion at the line is one of three with 17 points three fours and three Di and gets the first to make it a 12-point Advantage once again P's had 78 points against a good Denver team in the first half so we know what they're capable of and the offense has been up you just have to sustain it right right it doesn't mean you're going to be great throughout the course of the game you just can't have those five six minute loads where you turn the basketball over and allow this team to put up points in a hurry and that's what happened to the third first six minutes of the third quarter and they ended up scoring 45 the third 12 minutes of play and that's all she wrote final minute of a great start for the pal sabonis on the late pick and LaVine he had to give it up caught under the rim Murray gets another Murray's played well he's played really well and he's only a 33% three-point shooter but you know that he's not a 30% three-point shooter like he he got a clip on him that was Murphy flashing good look got some space coming up short that time monk gets it out and the easy one so fast break points in transition they're hurting and it's down to eight you got plenty of time you don't have to rush for a two for one either Murphy CJ got him out of position how about a three got it that's classic CJ Mccollum though I've seen him work on that shot a million times in the summer good job by Jose to stay in front and can he pick it up yes hell's to get the final shot they deserve it the way theyve played this first 24 minutes so now now take your time I like this right here I like this right here yeah Jose did a good job defensively CJ on the run and he goes to the free throw line and I like the play right there he told everybody flatten out put CJ and Zion in action and give them the entire floor to go to work together javante coming in for defensive purposes between free throws CJ going to the line for the first time tonight five to seven attempts taken by Zion hell are now five of eight at the strike so gante in for Zion the only one with two fouls for the pals well there's two Brandon Boston and Carlo matkovich everybody else in the starting lineup has one or no fouls at all so Zion sits down 19 points on 10 shots of 10 what I love Joe is a 17 assist that's what you like that ball moving and on 24 makes great ratio now got to clean it up nine turnovers it'll be brought in sa bonis right on the Run LaVine the easy one you saw that when you can when you can throw that ball from under the basket all the way to half court good things don't happen will CJ get it off in time no so the pals play a really solid first 24 minut minutes but as you said that's disappointing because you let him throw it all the way to the half court line that saves a lot of time what a half for Murphy and Zion CJ as well and the PS are up by 11 welcome into our Smoothie King halftime conversation here with assistant coach James Roo JB let's start on the offensive side shooting 55% from the field 11 threes what's working on that end making shots that helps right move the ball share the ball you know that's where we try to do here 17 assists too many turnovers right now but feel like the ball's moving good Pace right now guys are knocking down shots sharing the ball Yves has three blocks on the other end I think he probably should have four he's making plays on that side what are you seeing from him defensively and what he's been able to do around the rim tonight he's got to be aggressive for us obviously we've struggled on the defensive end this year but you know Eve's been a bright spot you know tracking the ball making plays at The Rim protecting the paint obviously it's not been that way every night but he's a young kid learning growing I think he's been great tonight you know making plays at the rim and affecting shots there battling some bonus and JV as well so great opportunity to hear second half for him as well thanks JB appreciate it man thank you back to you guys okay thank you Andrew Well the top three scorers for the pels Zion with 19 Murphy with 15 CJ's got 14 and they are combined 48 points on 18 of 27 that is efficient that yeah oh you got here's the thing Joe we talked about this in Denver continue to Value this basketball right first play of the second half frees up LaVine for a three CJ picks it up Bells were 11 to 20 under triples CJ 10 out of his hand it look good that's tough cuz the spacing isn't what you would have wanted but CJ made something of it yeah the ark it was a beauty CJ now five of six on his triples as a bonus gets to the rim Malik and Malik Monk and Domantas sabonis have great Synergy in that middle picket row now Murphy gives it away he wanted to go to CJ instead Monk and after the make get it up in a hurry CJ will another tough sabonis gets it and he wants Pace as well LaVine well he's going to the free and he was smart Pro put it down then raised his hands like I was gathering smart move by Zach Lavine as Zion picks up his second foul you said it they want to play with Pace right you saw Zach LaVine even after two or three made baskets by the Pelicans in the first half did a great job at pushing that ball and scoring immediately so Zach LaVine gets the first free throw attempt of the night to go he's got 11 the switch CJ's got a great look for three and Derozan picks it up D rozen's only taking one shot of the game it'll be two and and domis did a great job at stealing I don't know if it was Yves but he ran the floor Rim ran and then sealed and that gave Demar D Roan a free run to the rim you can see Domantas running down the middle of the floor he's going to seal like you said Lee blocker straight to the rim for Demar D Roa Sacramento Kings looking around the league Chad homr finally playing it again good to see him healthy and back on the floor and they went with hardenstein and homr not too shabby an Oklahoma City a winner tonight uh Williams connect that deal is rescinded so obviously Mark Williams did not pass his physical killer killer for the Lakers because trade deadline is passed and now the only that they can get is off the waiver wire Anthony Davis big numbers but unfortunately after 31 minutes in a win by Dallas at home over the Rockets left the game with an injury 14 of the shot clock out of the timeout Zion nice pass and Yves couldn't get it got to finish strong theard Derozan picks up the loose stuff so the momentum belonging now as d r rozan floats it sabonis he'll get it the second time he is working his tail off up sa bonus now with he got a tech too he thought he was fouled yeah and there was contact but they let a lot of contact go in the first half so a free throw coming up for Murphy and the bells in a four-point game tell you man Yas Sabas does y's work every single night so T capitalizes that is his first free throw attempt for the night he's got 15 points they make it 16 with that make now but too close for comfort five-point lead for the pals they're up by double figures at the break so rozan got the foul Zion on a clear out right by sabonis got there and got the finish and he was rubbed he was there was an armar and he talked to the official on the Baseline he caught that B and went immediately now LaVine shares it with monk good luck Malik monk hasn't been in in Rhythm offensively as far as shooting the ball is concerned that was a line drive wasn't it Murphy 14 in the shot clock so reset Jose for could see it coming not a bad pass it's a great read by Jose nine-point lead and a good rotation and that's a foul on sabonis great read by Zion Zion right you love this right be be quick decisions straight to the rim good finish turn the corner out the weak sided man I love the fact that Zion's not standing out there at that three-point line watching make them account for that athleticism 23 for on 12 shots right back to him banging with sabonis a little flip strong it's only his third Miss he's 10 of 13 at the field on the Run Monk and a nice pass it'll be a foul on Zion so savonus goes to the free throw line Malik monk set it up beautifully on the run on the Baseline he hasn't been in the Rhythm offensively as far as shooting but he is doing a good job at running this team's offense and making the right reads with that basketball in his hands yeah for the season he's averaging 18 team but your point is's only 33% from Beyond The Ark and he's been a spacer in the past he came here because of his Association he wanted to be here with Daren Fox and he's having his career year right career high in points rebounds and also assists and three-point attemps he only had five at the first match up with the pels fewest points in a game this year in fact he's had 10 or less in four of the last five against the Bells he's only on two points so far but he does have you mentioned it six times seveno lead for the pals yeah let's see if they can keep the pace up yeah that was pretty blatant and what they're trying to avoid the switch they're trying to maintain the matchup as opposed to switching so Zach lavine's bodying up and doas sabonis is going under trying to meet Zion on the other side of that screen that's two team fouls a piece with 83 38 to play in the third now Zion sets it up nice drive and kick Murphy hasn't spin away Demar Derozan you worry about him cuz he really hasn't tried to get the game going his way nice pass Inside by Derozan though good cut by sabonis off ball Jose off the rub Zion again bed out of bounds beding and it does no good and I think was Zion's talking about if you look when he takes flight when he takes flight they look at look at his lower body look at like there's look at Dom's off arm it's in his stomach when he takes flight it's hard to continue to jump inbound series with Murphy he's got the length on Lavine trying to set it up it'll be CJ deep into the clock breaks it off on Monk and across to Derozan he looked up ahead he wanted to get LaVine it'll be LaVine Jose good tap kept it away from Keegan Murray the taller man it is slowed down offensively Jose deep triple not close M on the Run Murray will get it no he won't Zion was a presence got to make the right read here got to make the right read you look for early offense CJ flips it in played through the contact almost five minutes impels by seven CJ with the bucket up to 19 going to be sabonis again free throws for Deon sabonis he's got a double double 20 and 10 you like this right the change of Direction change of pace shifting gears good finish through contact yeah you could hear it and reader lips how was that not a foulon so sabonis oh shoot they now eight of 12 with the free throw line I tell you this Joe officials got a hard job they have a hard job because the thing is it's it's you have players that complain on every possession from both team that they're being fouled every time down but no one's fouling it is not a as simple as it looks no they have the toughest job they have one of the toughest jobs in the world don't disagree Zion comes over to the bench javante in B sabonis misses another free throw so they are now 9 of 14 at the strike tells are seven of 10 off the pit CJ I'm a floater looks good and if you remember last year CJ played well here you remember here last year Joe CJ ball out here a year ago as well you don't forget the gyms where you just feel a little different for whatever reason shabon is on the handoff with Derozan in his mid-range area he had to give it up so Murray on the Fly by oh blocked away javante got the worst of that the ball got the worse today cuz he beat that off the American flag way he played through the whistle with the block javante with the foul this is the thing I Love About Yves Missi right he never quits on a play and that's big yeah cuz if if he's not there that's that's a three-point opportunity so now Keegan Murray going to the line f are out of fza that's the problem with 636 to play in the third and only two team fouls on Sacramento don't forget we've got a carnival celebration matching up with the Sacramento Kings so arrive early pregame second line features slam Funk pel Squad some of your favorite Mar grow Cru are going to be there and everybody in attendance receiving a city Edition beanie courtesy of P Whitney our friends at Hancock Whitney while the supplies lasts be your tickets R now go to pelicans.com ticks or pelicans.com promotion CJ coming up short and Yves kept it alive but went to Murray six-point lead for the BS got to know which way he's coming you got to know which way he's going he's SP him back to strong exactly and Murray line drives it long rebound can can't save it but when you're playing against certain guys we say kyp know your personnel you have to know what guys want to do more often did not as good and as dominant as Domantas sabonis can be you have to understand that he wants to come back and get back to that left hand they had a fresh shot clock cuz CJ did possess it so it's a 24 second and going to call the hold on Murphy they're shooting free throws the rest of the quarter so get comfortable it'll be 17 and 18 attempts man it is his second foul he's got three line so four free throws for sabonis who's already got a double double and don't forget what he did in the first match up with the pals and Jonas wasn't there it was 32 and 20 32 and 20 his first 3020 game and it was the first 3020 game in the NBA this year cat's had a couple yic has had a couple ever since I tell you the biggest surprise to me Joel is that that man right there wasn't an All-Star that was a surprise right especially since you know obviously the reserves are voted in by the coaches and he misses both yeah but you gave up a rebound that's inexcusable and a foul man that really Burns four-point game off Miss free throw so bonus four of eight at the strike yeah Keegan Murray just walked javante in right he walked him in can't presume it's going in Especial with the GU already missed now as many as sabonis has and the three four play makes it a one possession game so going the double digit lead we saw at the break Jose runs the set with Yves Jose bringing it back it's lay the clock can he get there good set up for javante and sabonis picks up the miss things have cooled off offensively Lavine with to Derozan he's got a good look and line drives at three B sabonis beats him to the punch that that's his own guy yep it'll belong to the pals and that's a break cuz two were after it and they had the position no let him out work here Carlos in evil get a break with 521 to play in the third back cour to javante along with those Jose Jose Jose has eight assists by the way tonight you just saw the drive of the kick now Murphy on the run and to strong Derozan he wants to go to the cup instead LaVine and they hot hand not this time free throw right now Sacramento Kings are just to the basketball right beating him on the 5050 they're just quickers at that ball it'll be 21 free throw attempts coming up for Sacramento to 10 for the pals but as you said you're going to be rewarded if you're the aggressive right always and Derozan hasn't really looked for his shots tonight he's one of four he got four assists and five boards and now back at the fre throw line for the second time tonight first time he was one of two again Joe when you lose lose somebody like D’Aaron Fox it's an adjustment for everyone right because he was so ball dominant you ran your sets I mean he he the usage and the touches but now you replace him in the starting lineup with Zach LaVine they have totally different games good call so it's not just an adjustment for the individual it's also adjustment for those around those individuals one-point lead for the P Carlo on the CJ needs help and you can see it coming but Ellis with the take away leaves it and the lead time out bells and you could see that coming you exactly right Joe we are right in this position where you saw Keon Ellis overplay that pass with CJ Mccollum and Murphy it is the first lead of the night for the Sacramento Kings it comes with 439 left in the third and a foul on the Kings right away it's on you got to you got to weather this storm and punch back well that's their third team foul here's on R roen CJ tried to get there locked up but the fou is called and that's a break is it going to be two yep free throws coming up for CJ go to the strip go to the line thank you they're not happy the CJ shoots two free throws the rest of the third for both teams now it's all even at 78 bs8 of 11 the strive 10 more attempts by the Kings Jonas into the game for the second time tonight in the first half five minutes of play had a couple of boards he had a bucket on the dunk now faces his former team once again it'll be interesting to see when Zion back in this game so they can take advantage of the mismatch of right if they're going to continue they're going to continue to play Jonas on on Zion right that's what they did in the first half and Jonas had or Zion had his way they're waiting it'll be Murray free ball real short CJ comes away got it when the floor is out of out of I I like the decision by CJ there's nothing there pull it back out they got the switch and sets it up for Carlo needs help on the dive it'll be tray met up top by Jonas lost the handle LaVine and too good to look yeah I'm going say you know he's not missing that one nope K Murray he's been the Catalyst for them tonight he is second triple it'll be tray on the reverse could get the roll and yell is with the ball's going to get a t and he does no they let it go because you're right yeah you can you can see this yeah you can kind of see it Carlo on the back tap D you saw this coming it was it was got right and try just got a Murphy just got a attack you saw that coming on the last possession cuz he's been hit a couple times attacking that Rim right you be the judge and I don't it's not even just that one it's accum right it's a buildup it's a build up three-point lead for Sacramento with three and a quarter left in the third CES is down Brandon Boston in who was hot in the first half with 10 points and hit three of his four attempts from Beyond The Ark it'll come in on the side with Malik monk again you got to weather this storm LaVine on the hand off we got there that that's the call last year that was caught against youngest almost they don't call that anymore the moving can't out front and that was an era of concentration a point of emphasis last year their biggest lead of the game is f Murphy put it on and I love that see this is growth and maturity understanding we talk about reading the room understanding all right I just received a technical foul so what I'm going to do I'm going call Carlo out get a full head of steam at Jonas Valanciunas and force the official to Blow That Whistle mature move by Murphy right and you saw the hands in the grab by Jonas before he launched so Murphy going to the line as he misses the first of two he was there for a technical free throw but that was the only time he bettered the strike before this always like to see what Arenas give away here they give away a piece of pizza not tonight I could have told him in advance right told him in advance Murphy's probably not going to miss two free throws in a row he's only 89 half% coming into the game that's all Sacramento continues to be on a run LaVine on the crossover sets it up for M he was overdue up by seven Murphy little space spins out and gets away they're looking for early offense it'll be LaVine they call that late real late because he coulded he looked back at the official on the Baseline it was a late call we'll have to look at this on the replay to see if it was a correct one it looked like there could have been contact 237 to play and a disappointing third yeah right right across the arm got him right across the arm good call to late but right and a dominating third quarter right now for Zach LaVine and Sacramento LaVine up to 16 Murray though has really been the guy 19 points he's been their energy guy 19 points7 boards for Keegan Murray now in his third season he was fourth overall for Sacramento comes into the game averaging 12 but he has been a guy that's been up and down the floor and working hard for them tonight n Bo game so they have outscored the PS Now by 20 here in the third car shares it Boston and adjust Carlos Taps it home Carlo stayed in the neighborhood it paid off buk good pass away Haw and you heard coach Jaren Collins this morning talk about when you're playing this is Sacramento Kings you can't continue to melt on screens by melt I mean die on some of these screens because it puts Carlo it puts Yves it puts Zion in different defensive position they have to cover you and then try and get back to their own guards have to do a job at fighting over these screens and not melting on them bunk up against Haw and on the Fall Away Top Shot that is Top Shot by mon a now his eighth season out of Kentucky H that's a Bou Arabia and Brandon Boston will shoot two both teams on of fouls minute 39 to play he get there clock is stopped capitalized couple of things hurt the PS though and you said it there were a quick stepper uh Quick Step always and beat him to the 50/50s and that that missed free through missed free throws by sabonis that took the starts out of the PS and M got it and not only got it put it back in but he was fouled for a three-point play what's a Del leg Carlo and a cut Zion going to be coming back into the game I believe I know it sounds crazy Joe but that stuff that they're putting on Carlos finger it burns like crazy he's weeping right now I'm being honest that's bur minute 39 to play I believe it brand Boston B now 10 of 15 to the stke Zion comes in javante sit down so tired of seeing this get slic Pizza thing on your jumbo and we're hungry those for slice you always go for slice now the second for brand and Boston good good don't let him capitalize at your expense eight-point game no pizza minute 30 to play but it's the entire second half so we'll hear it it'll be LaVine Rhythm dribbles he is a flat out threat from anywhere on the floor man what a talent four score 11th gear out of UCLA get the gr up Bo out of Seattle Zion all the way to the hole gets a roll they can they can stay with this they can run this same offensive possession and they're going to get an efficient attempt because if it's not Zion at the basket it's going to be Zion created for his teammates going to be LaVine hot hand not this time the long rebound that hurts second chance when you're playing catchup laravia and foul on Brandon boson Jonas scor at the free throw line well that was high it was really hot it surprised him it's just two guys fighting for the B right locked up so is at the strip saw Yas last night with half the team and I'm talking over the pels he is loved and and not just the pells but everybody has that kind of respect and feeling foras Val Judas Memphis or Toronto you would never hear a bad word about that man at everybody feels the same way and they really miss him at all the restaurants in New Orleans he was good he was good for the economy of the city especially Doris Metropolitan 11 point game 9685 Murphy held up by Keon Ellis little floater blocked by illness have a two for one and LaVine knows it he's going into Carlo it'll be saved by Loro they still trying for a two for one they literally have got every 50/50 ball this quarter and that's interesting giv it to the Kings and was it last Touch by the bells I know it was a back tap it was it was touched by the BS 21 points six to play 14 on the shot clock they just gave coach Willie Green the thumbs down basically telling him not to challenge it monk Rhythm dribbles he found his he found his rhythm this quarter he's in double figures now up to 10 with the triple and it's exploded Zion the floater how about that Runner beautiful Zion a to 27 in the M it was late but it was a third that was completely dominated by Sacramento we saw this a couple nights ago in Denver right the third quarter was the difference in the ball game Sacramento was the aggressive aggressor here in this third out was another third quarter That Got Away from the pels and look at the number that's exactly what they gave up in the third quarter to Denver and and the aggressive team is going to be rewarded and we talked about that ad Sacramento was 15 of 18 at the free throw line in the third the PS were five of seven but 18 free throws also is a testament to them being the aggressor without a doubt they gotten the penalty very very early in that third quarter so now the PS with Brandon Boston out there Antonio reev Zion Hawk and Carlo movich and let's see if they can put a dent yeah it's Give It Away first possession is a turnover Malik monk clear back it's a straight line draw you got it it's a straight line draw there is no defense in any League at any level for a straight line drive when a guy can catch the ball right here and be at The Rim in two dribbles with no resistance whatsoever it's too easy and a three-point play so it's truly Got Away Now up by 15 early in the fourth Utah the other game playing in Los Angeles it'll be Antonio RYvess to strong and Lyles picks up the board do cooled offs considerably still have 12 triples monk got caught in the air but final Arabia and now wide open and L mon long rebounds in those two every 50/50 ball you make your own breaks Zion he blitzed it didn't he and it's given away by Brandon Boston Man Pon Ellis you know that's good you know that's good automatic time out Bells when you turn the basketball over we talked about this show in Denver right a minute and 7 Seconds have gone by in this quarter and the Pelicans have turned that basketball over twice and you know what the Sacramento Kings do when you turn that ball over they make you pay turnovers are identical at 15 a piece for the Bells outscored by 13 off mistakes the network was brought to you by Smoothie King rule the day by New Age products official garage and outdoor kitchen provider of the New Orleans Pelicans by Ashner Health official healthcare provider of the New Orleans pelic and by seat geek get your seat in a seat PS bringing in out of the timeout welcome back to Sacramento C waiting for Brandon Boston Bei AR long rebound for Malik monk it is been drrive for the pals he had to scratch here in fact in the fourth Lyles and of the back it'll be Jonas you know I brought up Utah playing at the Clippers tonight and they're hanging in there but at the same time they're only playing one regular in their lineup tonight for the life of me I don't understand that Jordan Clarkson and the resting tonight uh Collins uh Walker Kessler Lowry marinan it's unbelievable zon Antonio RYvess coming up short as bik monk has it popped away Zeke creator and can he hang on to it out of bounds it'll belong to Sacramento like everything else in the second half Christie is telling the Sacramento Kings get up the floor yeah he wants Pace he wants early offense he had an early seal but they went away from the Otis who's working hard on the post Keon Ellis ly's deep point back to the pels 18 points game yeah the pells have flattened out offensively down to 44% shooting there's the wall she got the contact you have to understand what Zion's looking at when he catches this basket well there were three guys that first time get all 10 eyes all 10 eyes of the Sacramento Kings are on number one see when he catches this ball right here look look at everybody just drop right boxes elbows that's the definition of a wall now three of six at the strike bells are 11 17 10 more attempts but it's been Sacramento who's taken the hole in the second half for the contact Zion gets the go final nine plus this team will match up with the BS two nights in a row back home you know how I feel about that it'll be Jonas little jump hook action and Zion comes up with it can he hang on to it he does Yas with the foul out of frustration and and you know and I bring it up because two games in a row and the PS are going to Phoenix next month two nights in a row in Phoenix and I don't go to the same movie two nights in a row I don't go to the same Broadway play two nights in a row and I really appreciate everybody coming out and I mean that sincerely the Loyalty Factor but I don't understand the schedule Zion nice Euro Zion got home and he is up now to 30 points on the make so Zion is 13 of 17 speaking to your point Joe about a good block by Brandon yes got a piece of it Yves saves it see didn't see a wall against and that's the thing you just said it Joe he didn't see a wall there are certain players in this league if they see one player or two players that's the equivalent of playing one-on-one right when he looks here and he simply sees uh L oh I'm going straight at your head and by the way they are out of fouls so there's a lot of time left in this game as CJ is about to check back in 856 to play they just snapped a five-game losing streak to the pals Pals have really had the way with this franchise now can they come back and spoil the party Joe to go back to your point about the schedule this month alone yes right you play Denver back to back right you play Sacramento back to back you play San Antonio back to back and you play Phoenix back to back and what I mean by back to back I mean two times in a row right there only two games where you don't play a teams back to back that's in Oklahoma City on Monday and then after the allstar break against Dallas it is wild isn't it definitely a little different really different monk CJ took the foul yeah CJ yeah cuz Brandon Boston was hurt so you take that foul yeah to get Murphy in the game so he's headed straight back turned it himself unfortunately no contact but looked like he just turned it that is the second team foul on the pells sabonis little handoff action with monk he wanted to go back and on the long rebound yep tapped Away by Murphy you can put a scare into him Yves there it good pass Murphy got the contact goes to the line little the three-point play and we talked about this with Murphy it's one thing with the ability to put the ball on the floor play through contact he is doing a great job at exposing this basketball Joe forcing opponents defoul him and then finish it chrae on the timeout goes to the line looking for the three-point play Swing watch him expose this ball here Joel put it out there force him to reach after it didn't have to strength to finish 10 Murphy at the line right now with a chance to cut it to single digits here in the fourth quarter against the Sacramento Kings I'm Andrew Lopez this is your SeatGeek sideline report one reason your PS are still in this game Zion Williamson let's take a look at Zion's shot chart for tonight right now he's got 14 of 18 and you see everything where he's getting his shots he's won off his season High guys and tied for the most field goals he's had in any game this season and that's in 24 minutes 24 minutes 33 points in 24 minutes Murphy is up to 20 now he's already in a role where I mentioned earlier he's had a career high four straight with 25 or more and monk denied Good Help by Yves but aonis and good Miss for the pels nine-point game now you have to find a way to generate some offense without Zion collapsing that defense Jose back in there with Yves going to the hole didn't get the roll inside of eight to play Bell shooting 46% compared to 47% now monk feeling pretty good about himself and the long rebound good job Murphy otherwise sabonis thought it was his off the rub Murphy good set up Antonio reeds got it okay Huggy six-point game 7 and2 to play Antonio's first bucket Joe you said this earlier you expect the team at home to go on a run you just have to be able to counter that run and it's a 12 to nothing run it stays that way on the flat one from DeMar Derozan Pace to the race CJ looking for early offense Marie there Jose the floater yes PS back within four seven to play in Sacramento the Run continues at 14 unanswered and these non these non Zion minutes are so important what a pass man was it a travel they wanted to walk they're not going to get it it'll be a foul and a couple of free throws for sabonis good job by Murphy collapsing that defense Huggy Reed being shot ready I talked to Jose about this at halftime sometimes when you get in there you got to be a scoring threat right as a guard you have to have a giant killer once you get in there everybody's going to make you score sometime you have to be a threat nice floater right inside that foul line by Jose his second Pucket of the game to go along with eight assists sa bonis not been that proficient to the line but he's now five of nine with that mate up to 23 and 11 so Bon is now in his ninth season averages 20 a game he comes into the game leading the league in rebounding at 14 a contest there's also nin field goal percentage plays to his strengths knows what he does well yep six-point lead after the two free throws for sabonis so he's got another double double he waits back to e can he finish yes that's extension that's length you can't teach that Zach LaVine up against CJ good deflection they want to go over the top to sabonis M instead you can see him hesitant to let that let that three-point shot go too good to look D Roan the fou on Yves loose ball foul is the fourth team foul on the bells how about this finish that's tough that's tough man he's long enough I tell you Murphy's doing getting a a a much better feel of when to deliver these basketballs out of pick and roll situation pocket passes skip passes right there excellent deliver to Yves diving out the middle of the floor so now both team out of fouls for the rest of regulation sabonis on the short shot clock on the inbounds goes to the right guy LaVine and taken away by Murphy CJ popping up a triple tough just a little bit short right on line got to stop the basketball we know where he wants to go to the strong side good job by Yves line tied up taken away by CJ can you capitalize now now he's held up the floater it goes nice two-point game five and a half to play CJ got it done at both ends of the floor got quiet in here didn't it you want to keep it that way if it's quiet it means you're doing something right demar Derozan's mid-range she's had that forever in a day that's only his second bucket of the game he's got seven points six boards and four assists just two of seven overall that hurts try and gives it away Keon Ellis saw it again on that long diagonal and gets the layup points off turnovers to the difference B are down 27 to4 and points off mistakes that that's the that's the biggest thing we've talked about Joel with the New Orleans Pelicans when they value and take care of that basketball offensively they're potent when they turn it over they give the opponent the four game trip it wraps up on Monday night against the team with the best record the number one team in the West Oklahoma City and Chay gilis Alexander it's a shame those guys do don't have any depth man on the Orland man right right hartenstein and Chad on the floor together good talent and J Williams playing like he is all NBA inside a five to play Big out of the timeout for the P six point lead Sacramento nice crossover CJ and he was hit again he was hit on his way by you look at the Baseline official four and a half to play caught Zach LaVine peeking peeking at that screen CJ on the make up to 27 and almost lost by D Roan he sizing it up can to his mid-range by C CJ on the steel again he'll P up for the three Christi J Mame thank you CJ to 30 both ends of the floor though Joe so CJ now six of 11 on his triples Derozan mid-range over Yves got it three-point lead we've seen some entertaining games on this road trip it's wild 345 and cting Murphy off the rub ke looking for help it's Murphy on the take and on the foul didn't get the whistle he thought there was a reach easy and it's funny because by coach green was telling them why they were coming out he was thinking about telling them to go ahead and foul to stop the break right to prevent that right there the floor was out of balance excellent read by Zach Laine and the Sacramento Kings so the kings in transition once again pass break points they go up by five the pro the vet has put the PS in a position to potentially succeed tonight so we talked about Zion getting it his way and he's going to come back into the game now for the final 326 but it's been CJ Mccollum calm under chaos right remains calm under chaos he's been here too many times you don't average 20 points per game for your career by accident talk about Demar D roza and Zach LaVine being a professional scorer Christian James Mccollum is a professional score in his own right but Joel it's great to see him do it on this end of the floor he's had a couple of takeaways and oh by the way he has not been to the free throw line he's four or four at the strike but he's been talking to the officials because he has not ched away he's been attacking we saw the triple but we also saw him go inside now out of the timeout Zion CJ being held up Zion on the spin and the fou on Ellis he'll shoot two Ellis came into the equation late and he's trying Zion tell him I didn't blow I didn't blow the whistle but I like I like that I like that conversation right you saw that the look onon 's face yeah it's not it's not trash talk you're simply discussing it and is it going to be a challenge yeah okay here comes the Challenge from Doug Christie with 310 to play we'll take a look at it when we return to Sacramento so a huge sequence coming up and will it be successful for the king as you saw it was it Keon was telling him not to challenge that's what it looked like Keon Ellis was telling right there he went across the wrist to get to the ball it seems you be the judge I I I don't know about that Joe yeah that's tough that's tough cuz that's a lot of ball but did he go up the arm cuz it looked like it started on the wrist but they've got a better look in SAS as they can break it down and they will frame by frame basically so he definitely the ball came out and he but did he go up the wrist to get to the ball and this is what matters did he get the ball first because after we if he gets the ball first after that it's but is he on the wrist right there as they break it down and and and the thing is Joe there's a difference between the wrist and the Hand without a doubt right because the hand is okay the wrist isn't right hand's part of the ball correct and right there it looks like he hit the wrist before he got to the ball over the top so it's a real tough call especially in a close game with so little time left the points off turnovers though it's a minus 15 for the pals see that's where I thought he went up across the wrist right there and now they're looking at the clock so maybe they feel like it was a successful challenge yeah right there yeah that's where I thought he got him yeah okay I'm with you there Joe it does look like he gets him right across his right arm right there but it's taking a long time it is and that's alwayss that that that can be problematic and then when John Goble the crew chief looked up at the clock like do we put time back on right yeah and we're not going anywhere we not at all right we got plenty of time Oklahoma City can wait for us John Goble to the mic after review Ellis reaches in and makes illegal contact across Williamson's forearm therefore the foul stands the challenge is unsuccessful Williamson will shoot two free thrs thank you John good call Joe good call yeah I thought it was the risk those are great I love interactions like that I do because you use set it not trash talking it's like but then Ellis he did this and then when he saw the timeout it was almost like he was telling them you know what don't challenge it so two big free throws coming up for Zion where he's five of eight at the stri he's already got 33 points on 18 shots so he's got nine and 10 free throw attempts which is good to see Lou of Tod left good AR and he he's put pressure on that Rim all night whoever's been in front of him sabonis Jonas Valanciunas Lyles Keegan Murray he has put pressure on whoever is in front of him the entire night yeah he's been downhill all night and comes through two free throws three-point game three to play as I said they're playing hard they're playing with energy and when they fell down and don't forget they were down by 18 after taking a 20 point Le moving Pi that's offensive moving pick we never see those the thing is that's on the guard though right that's on Zach LaVine cuz he has to actually wait for sabonis to come to a stop but what you're thinking is I'm trying to beat Jose before he can get in a ice position to force me down to that corner so Jose with a big play at that end of the floor now wanted to go to Zion and the ja clock good pass Zion on the Finish Jose on the dime Jose's ninth assist for the game Zion is up to 37 two and a half to play Derozan they get the switch and that was a great job but you got to box out and that's the thing is when e goes to block shots somebody has to be able to crack back and take his guy out and that's easier said than done when you playing from the outside against the League's leading rebounder at 14 a game Deon sabonis puts him up by three two to play CJ midrange coming up short sabonis picks up his 15th board with 27 points LaVine and they're going to call a foul on Zion Zach LaVine going to the free throw line so they have the right guy going to the strike LaVine is five of five at the line is it be's done this all night he done this here all night as well yeah he's been downhill he's attacked he sees a crack or a crease in that defense and angle he's trying to take advantage of it 29y old and here he is it's like Demar Derozan I talked to Demar he's less than an hour from La where he's from Zach lavine's a Seattle guy Kent Washington and he said before the game he's when he came over we saw him I'm less than an hour from back Seattle the flight and he comes through fiveo game Bo they got a real talent Zach Lavine they had to take this last two years of his contract too that's why he's been in Chicago so long go to work yeah and lost ah hand but e is there Murphy let's see if Zion into the r and blocked Away by bonus and EV after sabonis hits it deck and keeps it alive 90 seconds left at the five-point lead for Sacramento we know where's lavine's going and almost taken away it is taken away now on the Run K tray LaVine took away the Baseline it'll be Jose out a three coming up short cleared away stays in five with a minute 10 to play if had their opportunities haven't they yes they had time out Doug Christie they started hot under Doug Christie when they took over for Mike Brown but they have dropped eight of their last 10it games it's kind of the law of averages this is a team that seems like they're still trying to find their Rhythm and I minute 6 seconds left Sacramento with it they'll bring it in as they try to take the first two games of the season series after the bells have beaten them five consecutive times and into their season don't forget last year the year before they entered a 16-year drought without going to the postseason differ Nows now you're talking about two completely differently constructed basketball teams Demar Derozan he's done that his entire career 156 ft away classic Demar de ro had high advantage over Jose Alvarado took his time with patient got to his spot Zion in a hurry and counting continuation it don't matter who's in front of him right now it really especially when the floor is spaced out right when they get an opportunity to condense that floor is different but when they give him space an opportunity like this look at the amount of space that he has this becomes a one-on-one game between Domantas sabonis and Zion Williamson go ahead take take take Zion and he's just fouled out of the game but how nice is it for them to bring in Jonas Valanciunas when you lose your Pig and the League's leading rebounder and you think wait I I don't know if I can recover in a close game and now Jonas comes in that's why you go get it gets another free throw in clutch time got 40 Joe man oh man 40 on 21 shots in less than 28 minutes LaVine using the clock with d roen this is this is a this is a tough match up and he gets the switch mid-range long to Jose here you go 18 seconds left and it's fouled monk with the foul as he tried to block it and they're on of challenges they lost their challenge it'll be two free throws on the quick take by CJ now you got to go quick yep you have to right you got to go quick and you got to make your free throws they can move but there's contact right there right there there's contact once he takes flight clean up top dirty down low succinctly put 15.2 to play now could he make it a one possession game because you got to make the fou you got to foul if you don't steal right away CJ's first Miss of the strike he's four5 with 30 points and and he's the reason here in the fourth quarter that the PS are back where they are right now after trailing by as many as 18 so 90 points from Murphy Zion and he gets that and CJ they have a timeout remaining but they're not going to advance it in a one possession game so Zion will guard the inbound both teams with one timeout remaining and almost beat him the punch now you got a foul from behind Jonas he'll go to the line 8.3 we used to talk about this last year the benefit of having the big soft touch that can hit free throws Jas Off the Bench tonight he's already hit two free throws he's got five boards Four Points in 14 minutes of play and now trying to bury his old team with at least one been there done that haven't we we've seen him at the end of games come through the pressure on they're going to love them here in Sacramento they're right now the 10 seed in the west if they win tonight it'll put up the 500 Mark they'll be even a 26 and 26 in the game over 500 at home and with the the V they brought in you don't want to see him in the play in game either he'll get both and a time out for willing and the BS to Advan it so Jonas most likely has sealed the deal for DG Christie and the King Pell's called the timeout use their final timeout with 8.3 to play so they're out of timeouts both teams have been on a foul for a half hour I no right know right lot of free throws 33 for Sacramento 25 for the bells Yves is supposed to scream he missed he missed the screen he was supposed to screen for Murphy Murphy Al take the 30-footer and now it's official Sacramento wins and they come from behind to beat the pells 5 five tough finish I I tell you we we talk about this all the time Joel how you lose matters right how you it's not losing it's how you lose that matters and you go out compete you play hard and you leave it all on the floor like you can live with this yeah because you gave them everything you emptied your tank right here's the the determining factor to me and it's not the mree throws it's not the attempts it's you you had two fewer turnovers than they did they had 18 you had 16 and they outscored you off
