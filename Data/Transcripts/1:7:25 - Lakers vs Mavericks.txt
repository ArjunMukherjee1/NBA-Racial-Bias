 there Marshall now starts Washington is especially in that starting lineup our officials tonight the crew chief in game number 21 Brandon Schwab and away we go in Dallas with LeBron James playing some outstanding basketball of late Chrstie has now been putting the starting lineup at his help and Reaves has been shooting and scoring well with a triple right there well not only shooting score but how about his playmaking his third an assist over his last 10 ball games that's only behind Trey and the jer's play just last night with a whistle and a foul and it's down low games to illness last year on their March to the Western Conference finals and the championship only one game lost to illness it's an outside shot here which will not drop Marshall K hit Davis with the board and LeBron the Reaves another three from him a rebound by the Mavericks who come in 20 and 16 which is almost identical to the record at this time a season too it's Klay Thompson Maneuvers and a runner and another rebound for Anthony Davis the Lakers especially with no Kyrie or Luka for the Mavs pace is going to be huge tonight good defense and try to run as much as possible here James with four 30 plus point games in the last seven goes outside to Davis three is not there he is on a record Pace by the way Anthony Davis in three-point attempts Here Comes Washington we gotten him in a trade about this time last year and he Scoops him home washingon going to be one of those guys without those two main guys in the lineup for Dallas who could benefit more fil go to 10 more offensive opportunities nice move there by Washington it's Christie inside driving hard with Dinwiddie in control for the Mavericks they had n Marshall is the main ball handler last night in Memphis and D Scoops it home yeah that's a tall order if you're asking Anthony Davis to guard one of these guards 25 ft away from the hoop James WS himself inside but cannot hit on the doorstep m the other way home record a 10 and six for Dallas with the number five offense of course with didn't hitting a three right there you can see why he normally comes off the bench tonight in the starting role yeah Spencer has not had a 10 plus game since December 30th when he had 30 points versus Sacramento so this is a good start if you're Jason kid for Spencer Dinwiddie turn over for the Lakers and out of bounds it goes LA's ball so the Lakers last played Sunday Reggie they lost by four out of balance play that b Turn For What A Move by Rui hot comes in and puts it through he's had two consecutive 13-point games re watching Washington I like it right there DJ Washington using his size and weight advantage against the smaller Austin Reaves Lakers offense with the rating of number 11 they're 14th in scoring Davis thought three Lively comes out on him and James with the switch Lively on him kicks it on the side Rui with a three back out to LeBron with a fake and a feed Reaves shot clock at eight plenty of time nice rotation Haim marai three rebound hustling is Christie to The Cutting James with the with the left hand and he makes the steal it it oh my goodness Wes three no and picked up by D witty James went in with an off hand andad oh my goodness Dinwiddie down low it's picked up on a turnover by the MS James now leading the break it's off the foot Ricochet is out of bounds it's off of Dallas have a yoke on someone like that are you kidding me you just cannot believe what you see in this game unbelievable Davis Lively on him doubled by Washington as they try to tighten their defense and across the lane Reaves rely got a hand on it and T witty the other way he played for the Lakers last year 28 games niji Marshall Washington Corner play he'll sit he'll shoot he'll miss the open triple trying to get it it's Reaves and he gets tangled up with wely going to pick up the foul please appreciate what you are watching because we are not going to see this forever we think we are you 22 age I didn't put that in my open wow no one at this age has ever done this in the NBA no and we may never see it again here is James on top to Reaves the rotation ends up to Hachimura shot clock at four now Reaves over Thompson and he hits a second three-point shot here in the first that was great team defense by Dallas just a better individual shot there by Reaves Reaves is coming off a 21-point game in Houston on Sunday as Washington drives into Davis bounced off him and can't hit the J and it's picked up by LeBron James accelerates into the Washington and Scoops it home in on the left side up with the right hand and two more for LeBron and James with an early Four Points with caugh by Thomson good feed by Maxi Kleber so you see the early substitution bringing Maxi Kleber on the floor here now you get more spreaded out shooting with maxi on the floor instead of lively Christie three it'll Sail Out of Bounds Hardy and GR come off the bench joining Marshall and Dinwiddie he out there for Dallas a throw away inside a turnover Reaves has it four turnovers by the Mavs it's Chrstie down low Davis has it we'll Glide right to the rack and try twice CBA comes up with it LeBron is out Dorian Finney-Smith has taken his place for the Los Angeles Lakers and here comes Hardy this could be a game where Hardy goes absolutely crazy czy without Kyrie or Luka playing Hachimura and ch's defense breaks up that pass and here comes Reaves the other way leading the Lakers with six Corner three and Dorian vny Smith can't get it he played for the Mavs for six and a half Seasons Dinwiddie nice screen by Kleber they switch up the defense and Davis goes on Dinwiddie step back three here Alice a started five of nine Hardy with the long shot batted away Davis has got it Lakers come the other way five of 10 into Hachimura got position and a beautiful feed by Anthony Davis well how about Anthony Davis recognizing that there was no way that Hardy was going to be able to defend Hachimura down low so just throw it high throw it to the backboard and let Haim Mo do the rest a just played last night in Memphis and lost by 15 U driving down the lane will they count it yes they will figure points here already with eight Reggie this is the seventh game he has started this season and when he starts averages 15 points and five assists a game as a starter look if you're Jason kid yes you would love to have your two guns in there but this is a great opportunity for some of these guys going forward to find out who's going to be the third andore a a double team two get to the line a l eight and nine it's the Mavs with Hardy Kleber Deens is coming the game now for La Grimes has the ball had a good game the other night against Cleveland what a great series of moves three to five Marshal three now rebound by Anthony Davis he's got five rebounds already we are see some outstanding play Here by both of these teams in this first quarter Davis accelerates into three and Davis is playing with a bad ankle with a word from FanDuel hey Chuck Mr Barkley yeah and nothing's going to fall from the CE kind of I did not know he was a cook it's good to see Dave Vincent on the floor here for the Lakers had missed a few games with that oblique injury and they they're going to need his shooting and his ability to space the floor he missed four games in a row gr's got it inside rely with a nice feed well that's twice we've seen excellent back Cuts here by the Mavericks one by Klay Thompson and that one there by Quentin Grimes Knecht the rookie out of Tennessee in for the Lakers diving is Davis again he gets another two a lot of his work inside give him six with the Mavs in control Lakers on defense have a number 21 rating but they feeli they got with Smith the G they go inside they convert Hardy got it well these plays only work when you have a center who's able to deliver passes like that you saw one by Maxi Kleber and two there by Lively that'll trickle in Davis now with eight and he averages 26 and coming off a 30-point game Sunday driving inside hard Grimes the former Nick Reaves is taken a seat CBA is in for Washington Grimes who began at Kansas and finished at Houston he's from that area from Texas last year with the Pistons Davis and he hands off to Vincent who gives the LeBron and back to who takes it in and on the doorstep he cannot convert that is two bunnies that Anthony Davis has missed fighting fighs inside with a pretty play flingers had won three in a row on the road until they're lost to Houston on Sunday and that is not a good matchup for them but they came back and they only lost by four it's Vincent the former Heat player in 0 three rebound by Grimes trying to make the most these minutes now available with Doncic and Kyrie out grindes on top Marshall free to fire a three with a rebound by Dorian vny Smith like the bigger lineup out here having Maxi and Lively on the floor at the same time tried doing this last night in Memphis it worked for a quarter then they struggled in the second it's James what a feed what a pass diving is Davis and a foul contact then Anthony Davis has taken not only years and really same with LeBron has been one of the major stories for the Lakers as they stand where they are the Freights are in vote today and every day on nba.com or the NBA app to ensure your favorite players make it to the bay and you know to expand on your point know think about the last few years for Anthony Davis that he's been healthy we''re seing some of the best basketball out of him because he's been able to be on the floor 3 or four years ago he was missing so much time to those little nitpicking injuries he's found a way to be on the floor and play through injuries and he's having an MVP caliber season it's Grimes trying to shake the rookie Knecht and takes it with a floater LeBron got a hand on it Hardy saved it m control cross SC Corner three gr Hustle the hustle there by Jaden Hardy which allowed Quentin Grimes again Off the Bench here putting up numbers Knecht with a three and picked up on the offensive rebound so we got 24 seconds to go in the quarter shot clock is down to five LeBron against Lively and the fade away three is sweet third best season of knocking down threes almost 39% this season Lakers are fouled to give three-point lead Hardy it's Marshall won to LeBron with the crossover knocked away inside Davis it's Vincent long shot no and the quarter no Kyrie what's the team mindset defensively in this one yeah well they still we have we have to have the appropriate level of Fe for that team they got a lot of guys off the bench and they got a deep roster for sure they got a lot of guys thank you Max yeah thank you guys now they put him in the starting lineup couple weeks ago and it's paid off Cleveland o triple so Prosper has come in Olivier Maxon Prosper has come in for Dallas joining Dinwiddie Kleber the three Klay Thompson back in Grimes is in there here inside Jaxon A's triple team grabs the offensive board and here comes Knecht with the mid-range shot and he does pretty good with those he's 63% one of the best uh mid-range Shooters right now in the league and the other way come the Mavs without Luc without Kyrie Irving and without the starting center dord c not no not KN for putting the ball on the the game three starters out and that's what they're going to have to go with at least for a while ankle strain for Gafford it was last night in Memphis so they're still trying to get a feel on that Kleber again driving knocked Away by Hayes and LeBron the other way after the defensive play by Jaxon Hayes that's going to be the thing can the Mavs generate enough offense with those 60 plus points out of the rotation for the foreseeable future those are your first words out in our meeting this morning how are they going to score well so far they've gotten D we need to go three of three he's got it here nice passing crimes a three missed it all Lebron early release Vincent Kleber there the dive the layup no and he's coming back as reg as s from a left oblique injury which is all about pain tolerance driving Prosper look like he blew a tire on his way up there too he was going up to absolutely just and was absolutely he's athletic yeah fantastic for Jason kid in The Mask all right tonight from Dallas the NBA on TNT is brought to you by New Balance if an English teacher heard that they said we've got now can I say I don't know if I can even say that you can say whatever you want I guess so yeah Hardware all right you broadcaster of the year you can say whatever you want partner tied to 29 biggest lead Lakers four Mavericks have led by four get up first meeting this season between these two Reaves three Prosper right there very active lot of engine in that kid and they go the other way with a drive by Dinwiddie and then here is Grimes he'll put up a triple Grimes has been fantastic here Off the Bench double figures with 11 he's shooting a career high from three and overall shooting on the season Dorian Finney-Smith they just got him in a trade play Four game for the Lakers LeBron step back triple Thompson is there it's picked up with Gres the other way working on kette rebound James Outlet Vincent watching kette and it is a the defender get the ball but then while the off play still in contact with the ball had the ball he slid down to the arm that's a foul and therefore it's an unsuccessful challenge they'll be charging timeout and will not CH sub plays his first bton Knecht an 80% free throw shooter puts it up and in he didn't have any points at Houston on averaging 10 a game and I saw him had a 36 point pre-season game and Phoenix scored 20 straight if I remember right in there phenomenal Phoenix game so during that drive as I was saying Vincent was taken out and they got James out there with Hachimura on the four Reaves is in the game Dinwiddie he tries to pierce Prosper will take it across the lane and dive and hit the deck can work on Jaxon Hayes and a foul is third Olivier moens uh Prosper at the free throw line he's only 62% this season every he was a first round draft choice by Sacramento his right traded to Dallas he's only in his second season Reggie hinted to it they love his athleticism Here Comes Reaves picking up full court here it's Hachimura Thompson is on him it's a Knecht three rebound by Washington Mavericks come in losing five consecutive games washingon doubled up and off and a foul there by PJ Washington can they make free throws yeah Washington at the line averaging 12 75 % free throw shooter and now Austin Reaves think about this Dallas is in the bonus now you have eight minutes of bonus here in this second quarter it's James Nai Marshall has checked in Reaves will put up a three great butter here by Reaves his third three in this first half Lakers have won two of three overall three of five they've won seven of their last 10 step inside Washington with James in the way and he gets it to go and give him seven Stutter Step James accelerates drives another left-handed shot and a foul he was going up he's coming off a game at Houston on Sunday 2 not only that he's shot 50% or better in seven straight games and again that's why I keep telling people fine wine it's Dinwiddie and Reaves now in double figures we told you as a starter he averages 15 a game and against his former team tonight in what he used to play for the Dallas Mavericks so he's played for both these teams Dorian Finney-Smith with the left hand and CBA was in the way and a foul called to Maxi Kleber well speaking of playing against your former team remember Dorian when I talked to Dorian he said oh I used to talk big engine uh you know just a lot of those things Ready's gritty he loves rebounding he can play both sides of the ball and people don't talk about that enough but when you can get a three and D guy that's reliable on both ends that really helps not only during the season but come postseason time brings a great spirit alley thanks across the lane Washington Davis took a serious it is and is a longterm he says it is not long term we're working on it we're positive the results will be good offensive rebound on the Miss by Dinwiddie inside Lively and a Davis contested the three as Lively went straight to the offens of class because the Lakers in the game but this has got to give hope and opportunity to some of the guys that now are put in different roles with more minutes look you don't get to the NBA finals a season to go without having some DCH right and understanding they went through challenges last year and found a way to get to the top of the Mountaintop by winning the West so you're right it's a great opportunity feed by Davis again another pass the big men passing well for La tied to 39 gries one of the beneficiaries of the injuries to the guards nji Marshall another one he played at New Orleans now he's a first year man oh great defense there by Christie Chris's got length and he've gone down to number six so he's improving 14 points in five of his last seven games while shooting 52 times there especially in the fourth quarter defense he's very quick on the perimeter he can shoot there he is right here trying to Slither inside it's D Grimes three with the rebound by Anthony Davis is collected seven rebound by Grimes looking at the Lakers this is the best defensive unit they probably have on their team on the floor look at this everyone is extending look to recruit hardan for Dinwiddie Grimes look at that leg Davis got a hand on it ricocheted the ball away but Dallas comes up with it Finney-Smith is on Washington shot clock at two rively got a hand on it Marsh retrieves it Hardy will put up a three rebound Davis number eight inside offensive foul down low Dory anden Smith Dinwiddieing gries Washington yeah they're on a string you can just see they so Knechted defensively there's a great play by Vincent you it's the Optics are right there this is their best defensive lineup by far Dallas is shooting 42 2% and there's a foul to get that added rest that's a big bonus Davis on top Lively will meet him lost it foul it's a foul on the M un Lively look like he was holding the come on we need more of that stuff four and a half to go Davis at the line watch a little bit scratch a little bit claw a little bit Davis yeah they traded D'Angelo Russell back on December 29th to Brooklyn and in place of him they got Dorian Finney-Smith who fits right in he's now defending bries shot good by Quentin Gres right now the Mavericks leading score with 14 Off the Bench here for Quentin gri Off the Bench as you say at 26 the other night here against Cleveland driving is Christie Lakers by one B four to play in the first half Lakers have led by four Mavs have led by four six ties six lead changes in the first meeting this season between the two Bri sizing up Davis likes the match up and takes it to the hole toian Vinny Smith was there with the rebound nice defense by La it's Davis in the corner Hachimura Christie aims fires got it a triple yeah they trust this young player at it Lakers have been six games over 500 twice coming in tonight with a record of 20 and 15 Kleber grindes Haim Mur will defend cutting the broken up on the play by Christine to the already pretty deep team that Dallas has with the Dinwiddie three and a rebound by James yeah Jason kid looking for that third and fourth scoring option with a pass by LeBron LeBron with another assist and with the beautiful delivery now we're into three to go here in the second quarter Klay Thompson quiet launches a three need it nice out of timeout play right there to kind of let's see if we they can get Klay Thompson going a little bit his first three of the evening number five all time in three-point shots made are you trying to rub it in huh he didn't let me finish ahead of the great Shooters of today's game and think about this he's passing me with two years basically not playing because of the injuries right think about if he never would have been injured he'd be right behind Stephen Curry I think of you in this era of the NBA what you would have done three-point shooting and it's off of Kleber on him approaching two to play in the first half got the switch you want it with Hardy trying to guard LeBron you got a thin help James has nine Chrstie Corner three rebound Davis shoved out of the way by Washington Maverick's defensive rating in number 12 they score the eighth most points in the NBA their numbers basically are the same as last year three Thompson good two in a row Quay trains it terrible communication on that highest screening roll that's got to be a switch you can't allow Klay Thompson to set a brush screen and get a wide open three Chrstie trying to set a screen for Davis Reaves is on the wing Reaves has got nine Davis will make a move with 12 he's defended by Washington and bulldozers his way inside nice defense by Dallas Hardy on the Fly Christie in the way kicks it in the corner Klay three Klay Thompson with the hat trick right here here three straight threes out of that timeout for Thompson nine nothing Dallas Ron Thompson run will'll call it there you go Reaves three at the other end won't go under a minute to go Dinwiddie the other way better find 31 he's got the hot ham that's for sure he's got it and quickly they Converge on him Hardy open Klay deflected by Hachimura in the corner D withy fre no it's James was looking at a possible two for one but now he's going to go for the best available shot here CH he's got it shot clock at seven Davis has it shot clock at five across the lane to the hole they got time here final sh that Anthony Davis has missed here in this first half and they were falling early in the game for him danced in with he James the bump to the W with impunity that aggressiveness that we showed in the first half but that is the goal for the second half he said we caught the ball at the elbow we caught him on back door Cuts Klay's constantly cutting working hitting shots he said we're getting out in transition and rebounding defensively they want to keep doubling Anthony Davis to get him out of the post as much as possible he said if we can maintain this effort we'll be happy with the result that thank you it's LeBron James with the beautiful Fade Away making it a five-point game this game has had seven ties seven lead changes no lead bigger than six double figures once again for LeBron on that shot Thompson in the corner n Marshall with a Davis rebound he's got 10 and the double double another one for Anthony Davis five straight double doubles for in the corner Chrstie three Rebound in witty Thompson had those nine points in that second for Dallas nice three right there by Nigi Marshall and that's his first field goal this is a guy that was averaging 11 points on the season it's his first field goal in transition three there by Naji they go inside it's away and a foul you were down 22 in the first half at some point versus Houston on Sunday you you win tonight you got a chance to get one of the top four seeds here and I know it's early a lot of basketball to be played but you got to be looking at the big picture here for the Lakers Lakers come in the number five seed in the Western Conference Mavs at number six Dinwiddie finagles his way to the defensive Reaves 18 to five run now by Dallas Reaves making work on that Baseline out to James rebound 10 he's got five so his numbers matching what he does when he starts for this Dallas team J Washington Reaves got it in the face and the open shot he'll drain a triple timeout been playing with their food James he'll punctuate that with see if this can get the Lakers going here it's a step back three tingy rebound Davis fly Christi on the cut twirling into Thompson got it foul with 11 and a little 5 run here how about Christie last season averaged two points two rebounds he coming off a 14-point game at Houston over the last seven he's averaged 15 and Christie tonight has got 12 five of nine and his defense has been a part of the Lakers performance didn't crosscourt and out of bounds 4 10 of 22 from three really on the mark 45% two to fire tin witty long free now and a rebound by James it's LeBron down the middle there forces the issue foul called on Dallas's D2 tonight 21 points 30 38 23 and 30 the last 10 games that the Mavericks have played Without Doncic and Irving they've gone 0 and 10 trying to Buck that Trend tonight and they've got a lead by as many as 12 and now by six Klay Thompson got out late in the D witty has put together a solid scoring night and he's got 14 twirling into Reaves Kleber tries to get it Taps it off to Marshall Thompson by LeBron picked up by Reaves good defle in hands there by Reaves looking for a trailer has Davis it's picked up by Marshall four years a pelican Thompson his three no good offensive rebound Marshall and a nice hesitation and two by Washington pretty play give him 12 James on the side Christie wikon was 50 and 32 and finished with the fifth seed in the Western Conference before winning it and eventually going to the NBA finals against Dallas there are the defending western conference champions playing tonight Washington down the lane another terrific play by PJ Washington who had 17 last night with 10 rebounds in Memphis how about the aggressive nature though by PJ watching this is what Jason kid is looking for who can step up to be that third option when his guns are about James Corner three Finney-Smith and Dorian Finney-Smith puts it in give him five all his fans are used to seeing that for Dorian 31 years of age he's on defense now that's where he thrives versatile player switch Reaves will watch Dinwiddie Dinwiddie gets his own Miss and twis it up and in pretty play Spencer Dinwiddie 16 now from him James and Kleber Davis inside with Washington defending see if you're JJ reic this is something that you're going to have to think about going forward in this game Anthony Davis they are switching every time with that high screening roll with LeBron he is getting the smaller Defender he can score at will in the post and they've been running a lot more screen roll rejected by Christie crank defense by Max Christie the other way comes LeBron behind the back and off to Davis wow and a half in the third Zone here for the Lakers it's tin wiy trying to penetrate and kicks it outside that's a three-point shot and it's good by the newly instated Jaden Hardy coming off a 15-point game last night in Memphis had three threes Christi on top Reaves and Hardy Davis a screen and Reaves from 14 grindes The Rebound let's go it's Hardy late close Christie another three oh he's knocked down two babies two threes outside Irving injured and changing his role tonight to cheerleader as opposed to player it's Davis inside slices in for the two and give him 18 thank giving oh nice move there by Anthony Davis and withi and Reaves Dallas is shooting 49% Hardy three three for three is jayon Hardy well it was Klay Thompson the end of that second quarter with three straight threes now it's Hardy here with three straight Dallas has their biggest lead of 12 Davis will try to work his muscle inside with a shot on the doorstep it's a rebound by Grimes he's got four sets up a three another one four in a row timeout Lakers overall and 50% from free 14- 28 Finney-Smith and he gets it off to Davis who's picked up by C nice move move 20 all right well now it's going to have to be done at the defensive end for the Lakers but how about a fabulous job here by Dallas ball movement and timely shots here it's grindes he six of 11 finds Cleveland now everything clicking cuz D dribble penetration because of those threes the Lakers overh helping now Washington out Marshall in Chrstie out James is in it's LeBron and Reaves here's got 10 got his screen got some space burries the train it's fourth of the evening 16 points now for Reaves three point shooting tonight forious here in the second two and a half to play in the third deflected and stolen stolen by gr he's got a trailer and that is Marshall love the unselfish play there by Quentin Grimes he knew that Anthony it's James thinking three popping a three Grimes has got it BR Grimes on the move and Dorian fin Smith will be on him re will watch Dinwiddie in the corner it's a three Marshall rebound Davis off to LeBron chains with 148 and six g v it for three if you want it on Reaves for three Clos Kleber rebound Marshall foul called foul on Hardy holding door bigger than a basketball game in the out of the Lakers tonight here in Dallas yeah the Pacific fire is absolutely ravishing a lot of the Southern Cal area go to my home as well down in Malibu same thing we went through about 3 weeks ago in the Franklin fire the lakes are even thinking that they sister had to be evacuated from the Pacific palisad Pacific Palisades area over 30,000 people evacuated thus far driving inside Jaden has had himself some kind of third quarter he's got 11 points and 13 for the game almost a steal there by Marshall on LeBron Hardy feeling it to James no call dropped by Christie numbers the other way grindes the trailers up and off Marshall collects and outside to Hardy under a minute to go in the third Mavericks have taken this game by the throw and squeeze they got to go shot clock at two Hardy puts up a desperation caught by Hayes off to LeBron here goes Dorian Finney-Smith fre they Dallas you would assume you're playing for one here can't leave too much time left here on the clock Lakers will get it a little less than 4 seconds left FL 18 points shooting from three to9 for Dallas inside Hardy lot of traffic knocked away seconds remain James in the thicket of Defenders Spencer Dinwiddie who played high school basketball in California then college ball at Colorado handful of teams back in Dallas James with the ball Corner Gabe Vincent three rebound Lively he's got six starting for the injured Gafford tonight Gafford with an ankle sprain last night and Memphis for the maves who lost to the Grizzlies fourth quarter is underway in the bench scoring category tonight huge Advantage for Dallas 381 clock at two driving Marshall bumping into hay who knocked it away and that's nice defense by one right there being number four this is what JJ told us you know without Luka and Kyrie this team is much more dangerous because the ball and the flow and the pace everyone is a live threat for the MTH Knecht Knecht 15-footer just into the fourth let's see the Lakers could put a string of stops together Dallas has lost five in a row Mavericks have lost six of their last seven without their two biggest stars tonight in their starting center down three starters nice move by Hardy to get free rley parachutes in there all the little things you don't call a single play for him Dorian Finney-Smith mm they are going to love him in Laker land I think they already do oh his toughness and his ability to make big shots too fifth game with the Lakers after the trade D'Angelo Russell going to Brooklyn Lively on time Hardy with the ball Vincent gets screen shot clock at five Hardy at their shots and almost half their threes ball on the floor as is James Knecht the triple all right here's another thing how could the G for that loose ball ke think seen it all and then he does something every game to change your mind or enhance it Klay Thompson with a sweet Fade Away how about the footwork there by Klay yes it's all about footwork huh 13 for Thompson James against Klay Thompson both Bound for Springfield someday James putting that in Lebron 16 points makers just hanging around but they're going to have to find ways to get stops because Dallas they have life here Washington three overh too easy too easy BJ Washington had a double double last night with 17 and 10 rebounds tonight 17 points and five rebounds James Hayes in stride climbs over the defender and a foul it's going to be on Hardy was he inside the restrictive area there back and allly I think they feel like I think the quote if I saw correctly from JJ he has now advance to full court activities with contact so he will be going five on five very soon there it's a promising update from the Lakers and also they hope to get Christian Wood back later in January as well so two upcoming new additions to add a little depth so they can get the chemistry going yeah wood had some knee surgery Ali thank you and wood is actually on the bench in the the corner Knecht with a triple so now yeah that's exactly look spry on offense now and he makes the correct play but what the Mavericks have done tonight short-handed without three starters has really been something Lively into a nest of Defenders and outside Thompson with a three picked up with a nice aggressive rebound by Grimes Thompson High Lively up high down hard and once again coming to bite the Lakers here James 16 n and seven with 1 three they'll drive in on lively jorian Finney-Smith knocked away Klay Thompson with the quick hands but he throws it away Hayes change of possession they didn't change the clock should have been they didn't change the shot clock widely is on James LeBron sizing him up just cross the seven-minute mark no Drive gets by him doubled up and off and a foul pass Dirk nitzky for the fourth most games played in in the same night pass guys what an honor to watch him play on a nightly basis oh my goodness absolutely the NBA's alltime leading score LeBron James so Lively picked up his fifth foul Kleber has come in under seven to go d e defended by the rookie conect and he puts it understanding angles kind of an underrated part but certainly part of the manual isn't it fundamentals footwork and knowing angles you can go and play a long time in this league if you know those three things it's a Knecht three and a Ricochet is out of bounds so what you're saying got to know some geometry they talked many of classes at Kansas stop that yeah they did I could start to Rattle off my curriculum right now but I'll hold off here we go it's Dinwiddie Knecht he'll accelerate and feed in the corner shot clock at three Reaves all over Grimes and that defense showed and it's picked up by La that wasn't a dead ball it hit the side that c that's holding the shot nice pass by James into Knecht 13 for Knecht and he's gotten 10 here in the fourth and theyve needed them both coming off a scoreless game a couple nights ago in Houston crimes corner wide open three how many times that shot by PJ Washington last year on his run to the finals from Luka from Kyrie what a pickup a season ago PJ Washington delivering once again I yeah Dr J would have played I was thinking about some of the famous players he used to play in that building late I guess he would to 25 you played reion get my right or no yeah anytime sign up at nba.com leag pass to start streaming today okay here's the story of the game you mentioned it plus 15 Advantage for the mads and beninge points plus 15 Advantage from that three-point line and a strength of the Lakers all season long points in the paint it's a plus eight Advantage for Dallas in the corner Washington aim will defend Grimes clle faking driving feeding grindes three he's got a plus 18 now some three-point L Reaves will reel in for two now Reaves 15 has got 15 points first two of the fourth quarter with four and a half to go as Dallas tries to break a five game losing streak without three of starters and two all starters in that three they're going to trap Dinwiddie Kleber with the shot clock down to four Grimes three rebound it's picked up by Reaves the Lakers are going to make a run it's got to start now James on the bench aim to Reaves yeah you're right block is ticking divis double FR rebound Mavericks the season best nine games over 500 twice in December there were two games under 500 mid November then won 15 of 19 games to get back where they are right now and a seven game win streak was included in that 19 game span they W 15 to the 19 and seven straight at one point oh nice Washington the Grimes with a great feed the second those are close the two teams with the two best records in East and W both are undefeated OKC undefeated versus the East and Cleveland undefeated versus the West what a showdown tomorrow Davis throws it away now we're at about three minutes to play James is back in for La one final push Klay Thompson out James the rebound it was Klay's three-point shooting late first half which kind of Uncorked this Dallas oh re behind the back Davis couldn't find it and Davis has lost it two times in a row now you got to run some time off and get a quality look here for Dallas don't need to go early here it's amazing isn't it even when you don't have your signature players Reggie it shows you the skill in this league the players that are not headliners Allstar can perform Like It On Any Given night that's a three and it's a shot clock violation too much time but here are players that are most all coming to the four contributing as a team and really making a difference and and even more sold in skill it shows you the depth of our league right yes but think about this for this Dallas these are guys that went to the NBA finals as re misses a three but Washington went to the finals you got a four-time champion in Klay Thompson actually CL was on this Dallas team that went to the finals so they understand what it takes and there's a lot of Pride on the floor as well aside from Thompson being a five time all starts a group that has played well made the lead climb to three and strokes at home 6 May three now Doncic and Irving and Gafford they come up big three-point shot no by Davis Lakers going to lose her second consecutive game and they're going to drop the Lakers are to 20 and 16 and Dallas is going to go to 21 and six up next game two of our double headers Celtics will be in Denver it's a freepoint shot which gries can't hit it's retrieving Z proser flying in Brandon Williams it's Christie C got a hand on it Knecht in the corner G Vincent three rebound Dallas under a minute to go and the five game losing streak for the Dallas Mavericks will come to a close and they're basically at the same position Reggie they were a season ago record wi but somewhat of a healthy luuka and three now they're going to have to go the rest of this month without those two can they continue to have performances like we saw here starting with the last two minutes of that second quarter in this whole second half Jaxon Hayes had it knocked away at home the Mavericks will go to 11 and six Dallas on the road right at 10 and 10 Lakers with the loss will drop to 8 and 10 away from LA but the the Lakers when they eventually get home we'll have eight consecutive games in Los Angeles seven downtown and one at the brand new Clippers Arena but that's eight games in Los Angeles in a row BRS at six threes
