 this team and it starts with the front office Kevin mchale was tremendous in terms of building that team but Tim Connelly and his staff is on a great job getting Anthony resigned here and extending his contract he and Jalen both getting Naz reid back into the fold Michael was huge and getting all of this business done right before game one so getting Jalen signed he's got peace of mind right now getting Mike con last year and also you think about getting Kyle Anderson but signing and getting somebody like Shake Milton and Troy Brown Jor into the fold these guy guys give Minnesota tremendous depth and the front offic deserves a lot of credit Tim Conelly is in Step Matt Lloyd John Wallace all of the guys SAA gup and Manny Rohan did a great job and this is one of the most talented teams we've had in Timber's history and there's a trickle down effect you talk about the front office how about the coaching staff Chris Finch is back some changes on the coaching staff but continuity so important with that group well that that's really one of the calling cards of this team is going to be the continuity so this coaching staff is really really good and Mike Nory who knows a lot about this Toronto Raptors franchise ston Turner the defensive coordinator from Minnesota he's got a lot of experience Kevin Hansen a really talented coach who goes back to New Orleans with Chris Finch so this is a really really talented stat that gets deeper now with corus Williamson his six years of NBA coaching experience on top of a great pro career he's going to add a lot of Veteran leadership to these guys and he knows how to talk to these players will be a great mentor for Karl Anthony-Towns and all the post players on this team orless has had a big impact already okay final thing we want to point out the depth chart we've said it over and over and over again over the past few weeks since we started training camp one of the deepest rosters in franchise history they've got great positional size this is a very deep team it's a big team and so look at the veteran leadership in this an all NBA Allstar type of players too Mike Conley veteran leadership Anthony Edwards rise in Star a great defensive combination and two incredibly big talented bigs in Rudy Gobert and Karl Anthony-Towns the dep in the second unit that second unit could be a starting five in and of themselves and you add Jordan mlin who now is back to the jmo the cast Train's gone the town's there he's shooting the ball great it's going to be a fun year almost ready for this one when we come back our ctiy storm goes one-on-one with Wolves Ed Menards on all your home improvement needs and Toyota see where Toyota takes you test drive one it's your Toyota dealer Toyota Let's Go Places the Tiber wolves on the road to

of tip off tonight coach good to have you with us it's a new season same high expectations preseason was so strong from your squad going undefeated now what kind of momentum do you guys feel like you have coming in game one well that's just the key we got to do the same things that we did in the preseason obviously we know it's going to be another level the regular season starting always is another level of intensity and execution and game planning but coming into the preseason we had a few objectives you know trying to find an identity work on our spacing get some physicality back to our defense um and we were able to accomplish those but tonight um you know it's going to be put to the test and a lot of your uh players have talked about the strong chemistry and cohesion of the group this year just with all the familiar faces that you had turning from your Vantage Point what kind of difference do you feel like the chemistry is coming into this season yeah you know we've had a great C Camp guys really uh have gone to work been very businesslike uh throughout practices you know I can't really think of one practice where I left just being like man I wish I had that day back um it's been a pleasure to coach you know with everyone coming back we we knew we knew who they were we just had to figure out who we wanted to be as a team um and they set right to work to do that an important game tonight the timber 7 won in this building in 19 years I know you haven't been here for a majority of that streak but how big would a win be in this kind of environment to kick off the new te yeah it's always been a tough place to play you know no matter what team I've been on they got great fans here they play super hard all the time on a home on a road they're going to be just as excited to open up at home um you know but getting off on the right foot with the win uh in the win column would be important for us coach good luck tonight appreciate you joining us no problem thank you tip off coming up shortly the Timberwolves getting set to kick off the 2023 24 season Michael and Jim back after this here on Valley sports Twin City's locations white bear in Bloomington last season for the Minnesota Timberwolves was an exercise and perseverance high expectations paired with a slow start injuries and the emergence of a budding Superstar Edwards Look Out Below led to a season with remarkable highs and unpleasant lows Minnesota comes up short their season comes to an end culminating with the first round playoff exit at the hands of the eventual NBA champions but now a new season is upon us look in the mirror and tell me what you see once again with high expectations stemming from one of the deepest rosters in franchise history A Renewed focus and a killer instinct is feeding a spirit of Unfinished Business not we success we expect to be really good in the in the west and quite frankly the the whole league we're loaded with Talent like we just got to be disciplined I'm confident I'm ready to start really I mean we think we can be really good but we can think all we want can talk all we want we got to we got to go out there and play and I'm ready to play a new season of Timberwolves basketball starts now and welcome back inside Scotia Bank Arena the excitement of opening night this place is rocking timber wolves with high hopes for this upcoming season and it all starts north of the Border let's get to our Chevrolet starting lineups no Jayden McDaniels just ink that new deal but still nursing a sore left Cal it's Mike Conley Anthony Edwards Nickeil Alexander-Walker returning home to Toronto Karl Anthony-Towns and Rudy Gobert as for the Raptors there's a new point guard in Toronto it's Dennis Schroder followed by Scottie Barnes OG Anunoby Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poetl Michael Gradey Jim Peterson Katie storm and Jim Pete you called a number of season openers you played in a number of season openers how would you describe the anticipation level before that first game this is big I mean we've had some others in the past and obviously when Minnesota first was able to acquire Andrew Wiggins Zack LaVine and then Karl Anthony-Towns after that those seasons and then the Jimmy Butler season to just recent history but the sun moon and stars have come into alignment here this is um as as excited as I've been since 034 and we know how that season ended for Minnesota the best season in t WS history and I think that the front office the coaching staff the players on the floor this is going to be a great season for Minnesota and hopefully it can pass 2003 2004 Michael wouldn't that be special it would and it all starts right now Raptors win the opening tip the 2324 NBA season underway for the Timberwolves so it's all going to be about matchups coming into this game so you see Nickeil Alexander-Walker on shooter early Karl Anthony-Towns matching up with Scottie bars Minnesota's got a rebound it's been one of the key things for them over the past few years and it leads to Second Chance points here for Toronto something that they don't need any help with Michael they were one of the best in the NBA last year in terms of all those intangible stats at last Touch by Anthony Edwards I mean Toronto last year first and points off turnovers second and second chance points third in fast break point so they turn you over and they turn defense into offense and you you can not feed that for them so Minnesota has to rebound towns a typical match up with Scottie Barnes Raptors turn it over Conley running now the Wolves will slow it up looking for their first field goal of the ball game m in the house towns the step through missing go trying to keep it alive and it's last touched by towns and out of bounds conversely not just defensive of rebounding an issue for Minnesota last year because they were 26th in defensive rebound percentage they were 26th in the NBA in offensive rebound percentage as well so something that they did so well the season before that two two seasons ago they killed teams on the offensive glass remember Jared Vanderbilt for what he was able to do Siakam no P the follow Jakob Poetl in the middle of his second stint with the Raptors we acquired last season Alexander-Walker will take a three Off the Mark hurdle and a crowd and he's fouled inside and it's on Mike Conley bulls have started this game 0 for three and Trail five zip with Poetl headed to the free throw line so towns getting back getting matched up with Scottie Barnes Jakob Poetl has hurt Minnesota in the past both as a San Antonio Spur and as a Toronto Raptor we played here in Toronto last year game 72 and that was a game that was characterized by a lot of Toronto Raptors having great nights including Gary Trent Jr Off the Bench it was a lot of double figure scores Minnesota was short-handed in both of the games really but that game 72 that was the game that Rudy Gobert was able to play he did not play in the game at Target Center neither Karl Anthony-Towns but you see Gary Trent Jr there no Anthony Edwards in that game no turned his ankle the night before in Chicago yeah coose no Karl Anthony-Towns either free throws foran Poetl in his eighth year out of Utah again began his career in Toronto was ated to San Antonio in the deal that brought kawhi Leonard to Canada that of course led to a championship here and then Poetl reacquired before the trade deadline last season one of two at the line Edwards the rebound wolves again starting 0 for three looking for their first field goal towns Conley on the Move Alexander-Walker in the corner no out of bounds Raptor's basketball you'd like to get out to a good start if you're Chris Finch Nickeil Alexander-Walker's got a good good couple three-point looks from the corner has not been able to knock him down and Alexander-Walker in the starting lineup for Jalen McDaniels who's day-to-day with the calf injury Scottie Barnes attacking left hand no battle for the board in the hands of Conley good defense by towns Conley the kick out extra pass Edwards in the lane and he'll go to the free throw line that's how you attack the close out that time Minnesota the pass pass combination which they work on so much in practice you know the kick out by Conley into the corner two passes back to Anthony who attacks the close out right here of Scottie Barnes gets him to the teeth of the defense Rudy Gobert in the dunker spot occupying the defense as well giving Anthony a lane to the basket it's one of the things that they want to work on a bunch and ask Chris Finch before the game what's something that he seen in training camp and in the preseason that he wants to see translate into tonight's ball game and he said the ball bom he said for what it's worth in the preseason they leted the league and assist and would love to see that translate once again in tonight's ball game they work on it all the time the the the pass pass combination so driving it passing it out and then moving it twice to the open player who then can either shoot it or attack the close out shooter gets that little mid-range jumper to go West Summer he had for Germany in the world cup one gold and was MVP Edwards outstanding in the Philippines as well and that is number 600 career three-pointer number 600 for Anthony Edwards the youngest to 600 in NBA history Scher the fake drawing contact with Gobert and turtle will head back to the free throw line of all the things that Edwards is good at three-point shooting might not be first off your lips but he's the youngest in NBA history to 600 threes Jim P well he's certainly in the top 20 confident wise I mean confidence wise I mean he's A1 from day one I mean that that first interview that he did with Marty gilner tells you all you need to know about Anthony Edwards in his confidence level and even though it's not number one of his skill sets he shoots it confidently and he continues to work at he's got the work ethic to match the confidence this game he shot 57% from the charity stride last season Edwards the pull up too strong Siakam the rebound and Anunoby want to rely on him more offensively this season missing that turnar around Alexander-Walker the rebound Conley over to towns deep three no and a loose ball foul Alexander-Walker activity inside drawing the a foul in the paint you love it when guards get down there crashing the glass that time Minnesota wants to crash and Toronto certainly does but when Karl Anthony-Towns loads it up and Rudy Gobert's in the perimeter somebody needs to crash the glass and pull up three switch beautiful you know one of the things they do every day is they have many breakdowns the beginning of practice where they work on Player Development and Anthony Edwards and Rudy Gobert a lot of time together in their Player Development before practice and we saw the hook pass in Chicago Michael unreal one of the best passes we've seen since that combination played together in Anthony again Heen up Anthony Edwards in double figures and after a slow start the Timberwolves have taken the lead it's a 102 Minnesota run Edwards three bow pull up Jay he has all 10 of Minnesota's point back here at Scotia Bank Arena it's Anthony Edwards 10 the Raptors eight wolves leading to exercise some demons in Toronto longest active winning streaks versus opponents by Arena the Wolves 18 straight losses here at Scotia Bank Arena that's had different names in the time that this streak has been going on the Wolves also second on this list 16 game losing streak at TD Bank Arena in Boston Wes did get a a win a road win against the Toronto Raptors but it was in Tampa Florida didn't doesn't count does not count does not count the aam driving Baseline Stripped by Edwards it's not a foul call it's just out of bounds 10 on the shot clock for the Raptors Toronto 4-0 in the preseason they're playing with the chip on their shoulder as well this season not a lot of prognosticators giving them much hope in the Eastern Conference this season they're in that playing bubble range there's a lot of competition in both conferences Schroder good look at a three left it short Edwards com out of there with the board he's been on fire in these first 5 minutes behind the back pull up Jay left it short Alexander-Walker over to Conley Fresh 14 Conley for three no nice Bat Out by Gobert battle for the loose ball and Anunoby gets it to shrer Scher inside Siakam extra pass and Anunoby can't hit another rebound C OG is so good from the corners not nearly as efficient offensively shooting in three from the slots great pass beautiful pass Gobert air and one and there's that man again I'm telling you aunt and Rudy watching them in their mini session at the beginning of practice and how they go about their business and and the effort and energy they put into those drills has been amazing and it's paying dividence Jim they wolves social media team posted a video of Edwards throwing an alleyoop to Gobert in the summer wolves fans went wild they know that there's a lot of meat on those bones in terms of that connection yeah I we we know that Kyle was the best working with Rudy in terms of finding him Karl really made an effort at the beginning of last season to get Rudy involved offensively but Anthony Edwards it was it was never really clicking and they made an effort this summer to make that happen and it's been fun to watch gr by the way that was a great catch and finish by Gobert andic three ball from Anunoby is good snaps a drought for Toronto now that Fred B ble is gone OG is is probably their best three-point shooter along with Gary Trent Jr which for Toronto may not be saying much he shot about 38% last season and that led the team to your point great B Karl Anthony-Towns to Gobert Big Man connection yeah man Rudy stand along that Baseline creating spacing situations for towns and Anthony but he's been really good at flashing showing hands at The Rim Schroder left the layup short quickly ahead Alexander-Walker challenging ad noi blocked great Hustle by Gobert and a great save by Poetl Raptors running but they don't have numbers it's three on five Siakam gives it to Anunoby who finally crossed the timeline in a kick off the leg of Alexander-Walker so Edwards drives to Baseline throws it out to towns in the slot who fires it down to Rudy who had been down low great ball movement so between the ball movement and the rebounding the other thing that they've really worked on a bunch and this is every single day in you and I we're just talking about this before the game is the defensive transition that that's been yeah it's been a huge emphasis for them and and they really done a nice job here kind of evening things out getting back in transition early on BR sucha on the floor for the Raptors to kick out to Anunoby who missed it out of bounds and it will stay with Toronto first game in a wolves uniform regular season game that is for shake Milton five years in Philadelphia first season with the Timberwolves and played well off the bench for the the 76ers bar Tren Jr missing everything Edwards down the lane a lot of contact and a blocking foul called on OG Anunoby the thing that strikes me since I've been coming to practice is all the talent on the floor and the shot making that they're able to do and ants handle has been one of the things that's been pretty interesting to watch to him being able to dribble in tight spaces and then also playmake off of the handle as well it's been really fun to watch I asked Mike Conley earlier today what he's seen from Anthony Edwards because the narrative coming out of the fever World Cup was that this is a different Anthony Edwards and so I asked Conley his honest opinion and he said just from his experience with Edwards a season ago better help defender on the defense how about climbing the ladder and completing the Oak from Pascal Siakam Gobert push shot just inside the free throw line no the athleticism for this Raptor's team is just awesome outside look rolls out 420 to go in this opening quarter it's been an entertaining one Edwards it's played so well the defense from Siakam six on the shot clock for shank Milton this a tough offensive possession leads to a turnover Siakam back to a two off with the throw down and Chris bench has seen enough it was a 153 run by the Timberwolves and two highlight dunks from the Raptors leads to the timeout under four minutes to go in the first quarter the wolves in front two points over the Raptors with four minutes left in this first quarter welcome back to Scotia Bank Arena well a big week for Jalen McDaniels who is fresh off of banking a contract extension with the Timberwolves excited and happy were two words used plenty in his media presser this morning when talking about the new contract he's grateful to Tim Connelly and the owners the entire organization for believing him he also talked about Anthony Edwards and Naz reid guys he came in with and has grown with over the years shared how great it is to be able to continue playing alongside them he believes their Trio along with this team is capable of many big things also you guys you might be wondering what a 23-year-old does to celebrate this kind of thing Jalen McDaniels went to Olive Garden and yes he crushed an entire basket of bread sticks because that's what you're supposed to do Katie you go to Olive Garden you crushed the bread sticks I love that salad and the salad very few places open late Jim Pete so Olive Garden was the move near still for Edwards Schroder missing the layup and here comes the wolves the other way Karl Anthony-Towns got a nice tough basket on the previous possession out of the timeout Edwards backing down Schroder towns deep three no good and it's Jalen Mcdaniels first season in Toronto Siakam outside three Trent Jr pulls the Raptors to within one cap help that time by Shake Milton came off to help on the triple penetration by Siakam there left wide open in the slot to Gary trent Jr towns once again going at Siakam that right hand good backto back buckets for Karl Anthony-Towns 218 had the quick bucket right out of the timeout and then gets that left bux postup opportunity and gets the rightand jump hook to go he's had a couple good looks from the top of the Circle has not been able to knock him down Siakam short and a rebound Inside by slowmo Naz re spinning couldn't get the layup got to get back in the hands of Trent Jr Corner three no good Tap Out Schroder has it under two minutes to go on the first Siakam the kick out four on the shot clock Schroder foul slow start for Dennis Schroder one for five but free throws coming I I know there's you want ball pressure on the perimeter you want that and you can do that with active hands but when you press up on Dennis Schroder you're giving him the dribble Drive penetration and that's what he wants to do it seems like you know kind of making him be a shooter would be more advantageous than giving him a drib penetration let's get a quick word from ericon Ericson products are so simple smart and easy to use you'll ask yourself why didn't I think of that Erikson tie it tow it load it when they go through their scouting reports if think you know this one of the things that is is a key for them against the torona Raptors is that this team is a very it's a directional team so understanding where you want to send their key players either right or left is important pounds knocks down the triple straight on finally gets that third one to go so he's got seven points all of a sudden Gobert with five Anthony with 12 Anthony had 10 right out of the box which is 10 straight to start a game doesn't happen very often McDaniels now it's AA solid defense McDaniels can't get the three towns the board Anderson all day three ball no good Barnes he's been quiet so far Trent lost the handle the kick out Schroder for three good they averaged 18 points seven assists during the F World Cup in MVP of the tournament leading team Germany to goal towns blocked 14 on the shot clock Scot Barnes with the rejection coach dark oh and Dennis Schroder go back to their OKC days it's one of the things that you like about Dennis shooter is that he's competitor you know he's got that competive a flare he's always had it since he's coming in the league liked him when he was in Atlanta my goodness Shake Milton helped up by his head coach Chris Finch G Trent Jr comes in there like a battering ram knocks Malachi Flynn over too unnecessarily wise for the Raptors they're in the penalty it'll be free throws for shake Milton looking for his first points and a temp W's uniform and you said this in our in our open v p he's going to be a fan favorite be around here with the way he plays there's no doubt he wasn't filling he'd get swaths of time with Philadelphia where he wouldn't play or be out of the rotation and then all of a sudden he get significant rotational playing time and even get starts and we played against Philadelphia a number of times where Shake Milton got starter minutes and he played well almost liked his game I've always enjoyed and admired players who stay game ready when they don't play and get a chance to and then take advantage of the opportunity that's what Naz re did a lot for sure it's been a menace in the paint so far 5 Seconds Milton going to have to put it up takes the three and left it short start of a brand new NBA season 12 points in the first for Anthony Edwards we're all tied up at 25 Toyota gets he caught up and talking about the start of this game the Raptors got out quick but then Anthony Edwards the gong went off and he got things started efficient three of five for Anthony from the floor couple three-point shots got a mid-range shot to go went to the free throw line and knocked down for of them and got the assist to Rudy Gobert nice job started the game and scored Minnesota's first 10 and so I was talking to you Michael about Minnesota Timberwolves since 2002 2003 who's had the most points to start a game Karl Anthony-Towns has the top two he had 12 straight and 11 straight in two different games that should be a good basket by Kyle Anderson Brent Manel is saying no saying he still had in his hand on the continuation so Town's at 12 against OKC and then 11 against Milwaukee Kevin Love had 11 straight Naz reid had 10 straight to start a game for Minnesota how about this one Troy Hudson had 10 straight back in the day as well back in 2005 so he was one of those guys that we enjoyed too back in the Kevin Garnett era too talented guard good Shooter had a lot of stuff in his game fun guy to play fun guy to call games for Anderson split in a pair at the free throw line tber wolves are seven for 10 early in this ball game from the charity strike Malachi PL the kick out it's an offensive foul mazri giving up the body that time malikai making the right play putting the ball on the deck getting into the paint trying to draw and kick the defense but NZ reid making a better one watch this he's going to get outside the restricted area passing crash you know I'm not a fan of passing crash but when NZ reid does it I am bucket and the foul off the feed from Anderson Towns now a free throw away from reaching double figures in this first half Scottie Barnes a low man has to release towns and come over and help on the dribble Drive penetration by Kyle Kyle Anderson the human Change Up Scottie Barnes mtim the jump because he couldn't couldn't judge the couldn't time him up man telling you and then towns with the beautiful pump fake hey he this is is a deep Toronto Raptors team by the way I mean they've got they've got veteran players that are going to have a hard time getting in the game Darko rakovich first year head coach for Toronto says he'll go 10 Deep B go go deeper than that yes you and I were talking about Garrett Temple before the game he's a Pros Pro I've always enjoyed Garrett Temple as much as he's been around the lead Shroder’s had some nice dunks missing on a three there one minute gone by in the second quarter towns wants three no bodies flying and Naz reid competing inside and it's a foul on precious Achiuwa that's going to be his first as we check in with our ktie storm who was in The Wolves huddle during the quarter break yeah Michael and Jim of course Raptors is getting a lot of action in the paint we've seen that already in this game in the Huddle going into this second quarter there's a focus to keep them out of the middle they're trying to push that ball to the side so keep an eye on that for uh to happen here defensively thank you Katie towns PL on the move an Anunoby falling down and they're calling a foul looks like it'll be on Shake Milton and that'll be Milton's if it's his second last season Minnesota was 10th defensive rating in the NBA Toronto was 11th but they turned you over and one of the ways they do it is they collapse the paint they take away your driver lanes and they make it difficult for you to find open players just watch all the red jerseys whenever there's penetration they are taking away those driving lanes and then they fan back out and take away the passing Lane as well outside look Milton short Raptors running FL catching up with it back to Barnes layup plus the foul they're giving you really good energy here the Raptors are they've turned up the heat defensively great contest that time by Malachi Flynn so creates the short shot and they get the ball up the floor quickly they turn defense into offense so fast good shovel pass that time by Malachi Flynn trying to figure it out too you know he's one of those Seattle guys as well from Tacoma area he knows McDaniel's boys really really well Malachi Flynn does but he's not really caught on he was at San Diego State playing for Brian Dutcher and they thought they found something with Malachi Flynn but he's still trying to figure it out Conley off the window for two good take so good with that right hand jimble wolves up three three minutes right now without Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony-Towns the leading scores as Anunoby ties up the ball game both of OG's three-point makes have come above a break kind of known for three-point shooting out of the corners good Follow That Time by Rudy Rudy no hle comes out of there with it Chris Finch upset out a no call inside an Anunoby is the try to regain the lead pass stolen slowmo over to reid fouled goes down and hits the cameraman and here's that drama with cameraman in N but if looks could kill Malachi Flynn would be the late great right now because n shot him a glare and he's still talking look look at him right now showing the replay but Naz reid and Malachi Flynn squared up before I don't know if we could have gotten that but yeah re and Scottie Barnes I'm just telling you that is not happy it's the first wolves fans spend Saturday night with the Wolves when they tip off the season against the Miami Heat on Saturday all fans will score a wolves back t-shirt at the game get TI tickets at Timber wolf.com tickets big Ovation right now as the rookie out of Kansas Gradey dick making his NBA debut fan favored I see a lot of gry blow up heads in the crowd they're excited about the young fella off the window Barnes can't get the shot to fall wolves by two LOB Out Of Reach for Gobert who gets it back but turns it over fourth turn over for Minnesota the love and noi the finish off the great feed from Malachi roles quickly the other way Conley getting past grd dick but a foul is called and it is on Gradey dick that's going to be his first and that's already the f 15 foul on Toronto feel like when you're running and transition get into the body of somebody that's running away when these guys when these Raptors are filling the lane and you're getting back in transition you should put a body on them try to angle them off and so I know it's easier set than done but we'll have three white jerseys back there got to quit turning and over too that's that's been the killer but you got to credit Toronto and their defensive pressure too right they they've turned up the heat here in this second quarter we know how talented they are defensively as Anthony Edwards checks back into the ball game Raptors having trouble defending without fouling they're already in the penalty with 827 to go in this second quarter conin solid career free throw shooter cans both wolves back up by two wolves not really shooting the three with the same Vigor that they were shooting in the exhibition season only 12 attempts right now three of 12 Toronto winning the three-point battles early on not that much but they are Brady dick the reverse no good rebound go be pass inside go in the weeds fouled by Malachi Flynn it'll be free throws for Gobert Kyle Anderson he right down the shoot that time Rudy Gobert had Poetl sealed and Dick came from the Baseline side left Mike Conley in the corner to come help it as the low man really did a good job of drawing the foul tell you what I I've just been coming to practice the past week or so you've been there the whole season but one thing that I've noticed about Rudy Gobert is that he's in great shape he's been he's been athletic in practice and it's it's been fun to watch you know that see everybody the work that they're putting in but but Rudy Gobert has impressed me with his athleticism and the way that he's flying around and again we've talked about this comparing this to a season ago where Anthony Edwards immediately came in not in the best shape Karl Anthony town was sick that's a great SWAT by Rudy Gobert who had a knee injury at the start of training camp last season and then you compare that to this year where so many key players played in the FEA World Cup in tiptop shape playing at a high level and it really carried over the training camp Kyle Anderson Anthony Edwards more mention go Anthony-Towns bars for three talking to the Toronto broadcasters before the game they were all saying Scottie Barnes has worked on his three-point shot everybody says that but we'll see if it transpires Edwards driving can't hit Gobert staying with it and Edwards gets it back stripped off his leg out of bounds there's that defense from Toronto active hands one of the calling cards of his Toronto Raptors team is the Octon hands Trent Jor hand handle it loses it out of bounds as another player who played well in the fever World Cup Nel Alexander-Walker who started tonight helped Team Canada win their first ever medal in international competition a bronze leading Team USA in OT listening to Chris Finch before the game they were talking about Nickeil they were asking about his maturation process and VCH was talking about his time as Mike Conley loads up the three can't get it to go his time in New Orleans as a rookie fin was there with him and like a lot of young players when they come into the league they want to show you everything all at once and and so Nickeil finally is coming into his own right now as a player just under seven minutes to go in the first half wolves hanging on to a one-point lead the Wolves leading by one trying to do something Jim Pete that they haven't done in nearly 20 years let's flash back January 21st 2004 number one overall pick in the June draft Victor wiama was 20 days old also on January 21st 2004 the Minnesota Wilds set a then NHL record for the two fastest goals in league history just 3 seconds that record has since been broken but that was also the day the Timberwolves last beat the Raptors in Toronto Wild on a night where Latrell sprw well Sam Cassell and Kevin Garnett combined for 82 of the team's 108 points is Purtle out of the timeout gets the lay in Montreal Canadians broke that record by by the way by scoring two goals in two seconds unreal how s 2018 Conley around to go be screen Alexander-Walker the fake the pull up off window for two first field goal for Alexander-Walker wolves back up by one read the Reb down Edwards he just joining us fantastic in that opening quarter at the first 10 points for the Wolves reid missing Gobert hits it off the pause of Gary Tren Jr that was a smart play by Rudy that just kept it alive doing the Rodman kind of tipping up tipping it up and then throws it right off of him smart play volleyball game working well for Rudy in this first half Karl Anthony-Towns checks in for Naz reid Jakob Poetl takes a seat presses a cheer who's played well for Toronto checks back in for the wraps Edwards trying to get past Anunoby floats it up and off an anovi all defensive second team a season ago on the attack this time and gets the lay in squeezing past Alexander-Walker for the deuce OG's been dynamic in this game go good position and he's fouled by Pascal Siakam with the incredulous look after the whistle double drag action and so when they set those two screens for Mike Conley and transition like that Karl Anthony-Towns and then Rudy Karl Anthony-Towns pops Rudy Dives to the front of the rim high low action after that trying to get Rudy Gobert involved intentionally so Conley can turn the corner and make a play but rules a lot of times get that high low action let's hear from Grand Casino so we set out to see the Harvest Moon and we see it over Grand Casino a sign right we played until the sum was up and so were we up $1,500 Gobert 0 for two at the free throw line there he was perfect before that one three or five and Anunoby good look at a deep shot knocks it down been their best player and he shot just under 39% from three last season he's now three for five in this first half 5 minutes to go second quarter 10-2 Toronto run Alexander-Walker over to towns Town firing in and out go the putback Schroder tries to lob it to AA Schroder and they call a foul on Alexander-Walker aggressive along the Baseline that's going to be his second foul fourth foul on the walls handoff action towns was going to go under again a Achiuwa was setting a screen towns was going to go under did not press up and get over the top just a little spot shot but then Rudy Gobert on the the towns miss opportunistic doing what he does we average three offensive rebounds game last year you know he did his part didn't always was convert zaka no the strong rebound and the flush that's that's a rebound that has to come up with he just got manhandled that time Wes trying to final Rhythm offensively shooting just 32% Gobert over to towns contact inside no call Active hands Again by Toronto something that Chris Finch is going to want to talk about Schroder hits the three Chris Fitch needs time you got to protect the basketball Bo how many deflections as Toronto had in this game Michael 15 to four run by the Raptors here who's got to regroup shooter three makes it a seven-point ball game window Concepts again left box post up for Anthony and he's trying to find Rudy Gobert but look at all the red jerseys and then tanthony DS is a cutter here it's just horrible spacing by Minnesota look at all the red jerseys but watch Siakam he's going to have active hands swipe at the ball and then Scottie Barnes is too and they get the possession and then they're Off to the Races I mean Siakam comes Sprint dribbling down the floor and they are on a 15 to4 run by doing just that it's been poor spacing at times Minnesota but it's been active hands a lot of deflections give Toronto credit here for what they've done here in the second quarter H Edwards headed to the free throw line as we welcome back arcadey storm yeah guys I was just in the Huddle and Chris Finch just doesn't like the way his team isn't finishing through contact they're getting the physicality on both ends from Toronto and they're not able to respond and something else to note in the preseason that Chris Finch defensively liked the physicality from his team he said that they were doing what big teams do and that's just not the case right now thank you so much Katie and we are Courtside here at Scotia Bank Arena and Karl Anthony-Towns walked by the scores table and said to us I'm going to the glass the rest of the quarter that'll be something to keep an eye on yeah I'm looking forward to it that's one of the things I'm curious about with this Timberwolves team saying this respectfully can they Embrace being the bully being a physical team they were a big team a season ago didn't play big can they do that this season swatted out of bounds by Karl Anthony-Towns 10 on the shot clock for Toronto towns with 10 points two rebounds so far four of 11 shooting and as a team the Timberwolves now under 32% shooting Trail by five Schroder and make it an eight-point game here comes Edwards the other way two points since that 12-point first quarter Edwards in the lane puts it up and off gets it back spins inside stripped and stolen shrer the other way Raptors running jayen McDaniels can't hit precious Achiuwa the put back no rebound to com his third getting a tunnel vision right now wolves with their sixth turnover and there's a foul that will put Toronto at the free throw line an trying to take control of the game since Minnesota's had trouble scoring here be Scottie Barnes at the free throw line our officials tonight are crew chief Kevin Scott alongside Brett nansel and Brandon schw Barnes with six points the all important third NBA season for Scottie Barnes set your compass due north Thursday nights on B Sports join host Travis Frank and Natalie Dylan as they share stories and Adventures of outdoor enthusiasts in the Upper Midwest du North Outdoors tomorrow at p.m. on Valley Sports Conley breaking three and getting the lay in nice pass from towns 49 45 approaching 230 to go in this first half back and forth Affair between the Raptors in the Wolves a CH lot of head fakes somehow kept his pivot out of bounds and it will stay with Toronto with 3.8 on the shot clock strong defense by Karl Anthony-Towns that time standing up precious Achiuwa at the point of attack in the painted area kind of got got away with maybe a little bit of a foul right there there was a lot happening there Naz reid andley sits Here Comes Edwards the kick out reid outside look towns inside the layup won't go but tips it in said he was going to the glass under two minutes to go in this first half both teams in the penalty Barnes Brandon Schwab with the call there Karl Anthony-Towns attacking the close out of precious Achiuwa can't get the initial layup attempt to go but gets the put back at the other end Scottie Barnes comes curling around that handoff action at towns and Karl looked like to me verticality that time he kind of just went straight up I like to see again yeah it was wasn't great angle was a little bit funky that time you can see why they called the foul you got to take the proper angle to get that call Barnes with nine points Alexander-Walker now it's Anderson on a Town screen slowmo downhill too strong Barnes rebound running bounce pass out of bounds and the Wolves arguing the call if s it's going to stay with Toronto Minnesota's bench scoring rather anemic here early on N got hand on it looked like it kind of maybe glanced off the guy an obi's foot but just four points for the bench from Minnesota Anderson with one Milton with one Naz reid has two points on two free throw tips Siakam no Downs the strong rebound that's the only way the bench has scored so far they have zero field goals in this game towns once again to the cup can't get the layup the ball Barnes once again leading in transition turns it over and miscommunication Alexander trying to get it up ahead to Edwards who wasn't looking missed opportunity with 64 seconds to go in this first half and the wolves have turned it over seven times shooting under 32% still only Trail by four an Anunoby trying to add to that deficit and cannot FL from Minnesota he had the ball everybody else was running Siakam draws the foul it's going to be on Kyle Anderson two coming two coming so it'll be two free throws for Pascal Siakam free throws have been Minnesota's friend in this game and got 20 attempts see get the Finish but then nobody was back just for all the issues in this first half the bench production hasn't been there so far the shooting percentage has been low turn over starting to add up in the second quarter you're still only down three points with one more free throw for Pascal Siakam correctable things as you approach the second half finishing through contact I've been talking about the deflections but you know it's it Katie was talking about Chris Finch talking about this during a timeout finishing through contact has been an issue for the wolves in the past so they they played so strong and so together in the exhibition season it it looked like there was going to be kind of a seamless transition there is something to be said and Chris fin said this before the game when the lights are on in the regular season starts it's been a little different in this first half Edwards He's been outstanding so far putting the moves on Anunoby off one leg no battle for the board Edwards gets it back two seconds off glass money 6 seconds Siakam driving lost it out of bounds and it should be Minnesota basketball and they make the correct call 2.9 on the game clock wol down two get down the floor use the long pass 2.9 plenty of time to score here what a bucket on that previous possession by Edwards love it re throws it down court and how about that off the hands of Anunoby so it'll be better position for the wolves with 1.7 on the game clock ill advised but it worked out really big time it did work out Jalen McDaniels checks in for Pascal Siakam Siakam taking the cidd has two fouls and it'll be Anderson to work it in gets it in Edwards tough turnar around left it short but what a first half for Anthony Edwards 18 points nine rebounds in the first half of play plenty to improve upon in the second half we shoot just 33% and they Trail the Raptors by two on Bal Sports it's Scotia Bank Arena I'm joined by Wolves assistant coach corus Williamson and Coach Toronto presenting a lot of physicality in that second quarter what's the plan to combat that down the stretch here we come out and just move the ball a little bit better we only have seven assist in the first half and that's not characteristic of how we move the basketball so we have to get off the ball a little more and try to create some open gaps well keep an eye on that good luck coach thank you coret Williams saying good to hear from him now time for the Menard second half Scout for that Jim Peterson we go over to you thank you very much Katie storm and I think when you look at how that second quarter kind of transpired you know they didn't finish through contact well it's something they were doing more of in that first quarter but Toronto really put the pressure on Minnesota Anthony Edwards has carried quite the heavy load here in the first half got a little bit ball conscious in terms of trying to take over the game a little bit it's a little bit of what corus was talking about in terms of ball movement the ball movement did stop a little bit in that second quarter so they got to pick that up and then the three-point battle has definitely gone into the category of the Toronto Raptors they shot the ball much better outside the arc than Minnesota to just three of 15 for the Timberwolves from three point range 8 of 21 for 38% for Toronto and OG Anunoby was excellent in that first half for Toronto from outside the arc he was three of six see the four factors Michael points off turnover even but ties always go to Minnesota Second Chance points tell you what Toronto had seven offensive rebounds they converted every one of them Minnesota actually had a better rebounding first half Tron did wolves actually had 32 rebounds in that first first half just 24 an had nine of them how about how about him rebounding the basketball at that rate that's great to see most by a wolves guard in a half since Cory Brewer 5 seconds on the shot clock Edwards tries to go off window no shrer missing the lay Gobert getting back to clear the board tell what man Rudy's been running the floor both ends too by the way he's been getting back on defense his defensive transition's been excellent been impressed with his ability to run the floor then can't finish on the pocket pass by Mike and Anunoby lining up a Trey can't hit another rebound for Gobert  he's now in double figures in rebounding nine points 10 rebounds for Goert Edwards driving and knocked out of bounds and this is what Chris Finch talked about you mentioned it a moment ago corus Williamson brought it up with arcade storm just seven assists in that first half and Chris Finch mentioned earlier that again they led the league an assist in the preseason he said that's not necessarily indicative of anything because the ball could get sticky when the bright lights are on and that's what we saw in the first half ounds ISO ball once again leading to a Miss shot Schroder it's pretty easy right there just come down to transition hit the open guy knock down a three-point shot an was trying to take Jakob Poetl in an ISO situation on a mismatch but Rudy was in the paint towns trying to take on two Defenders two on the Baseline last possession Alexander-Walker the kick out Conley wants three and answers back need that that's a great answer as you mentioned Mike now with nine points in the game terms of ball M but the Raptors have 15 assists on 19 field goals make that 20 field goals as Jakob Poetl gets to the rim he has seven points and six boards Walker driving the kick out Edwards steps into a two Rams out Karl Anthony-Towns too strong on the follow Siakam right down the lane and Chris fch calling time out 2 minutes and 32 seconds into the third quarter not liking what he's saying again transition D was a big focus in training camp in the preseason season and seum Little Resistance right to the rim Bronto a lot of hype headed into this season about the inaugural inseason tournament Timberwolves in group C with the Kings Warriors OKC and the San Antonio Spurs four inseason tournament games before you get to the single elimination tournament which will culminate with the final four in Las Vegas Jim yeah we get the San Antonio Spurs we going a long road trip in November on the 10th that's the first tournament game for Minnesota at San Antonio I then the two games at Golden State as Mike Conley knocks down the three the two games we played back to back at Golden State on the 12th and 14th that Tuesday game is another inseason tournament against in the open court and knocked out of bounds off of Scottie Barnes Still you got to like the activity for Rudy Gobert yeah Rudy's played good in this game he's got 10 rebounds on the game he's got the nine points and he's giving you some really good effort Conley to work it in back door Timberwolves trailing by four first game of the season high expectations Conley taking his time right hand floater no here come the Raptors the other way Siakam down the lane laying it in we've seen so much of that from Pascal Siakam when he gets off to the races like that he's so hard to stop momentum he's so slippery Edwards kicks it out towns the floater won't go Siakam another board Toronto a 26 advantage in Fast Break points Barnes eight seconds for Siakam mid-range P up no good rebound Alexander-Walker who along with Leonard Miller got a nice Ovation during that last timeout no bad pass Raptors four fast break points Ry was trying to seal the ball just sailed over the top in just making it difficult for themselves Michael this offensive efficiency has been fueling this fast break foron steady hands of Kyle Anderson will check in next dead ball largest lead of the game for Toronto there's a lob that's o with the double double 11 points 10 rebounds Alexander-Walker trying to contend with Siakam did a great job there secured the rebound Edwards free throw line pull up short Gobert was sealed Here Comes shrer Barnes wants three no good another opportunity to cut into this Toronto lead towns off the pump fake another lob and he had an open look in the lane shrer quickly the other way for two poor sequence for the wolves defense never committed they never came to towns to Karl had that Del layup he could have dunked it if he wanted to there's another huge flush from Rudy Gobert as poorly as Minnesota's played here they're just six points talented the game they've got to get a playing this ball game without their best perimeter defender in Jalen McDaniels who's day to-day with that calf injury con get it up the towns Edwards double team now ISO with anovi the kick out outside look won't go down Anunoby the board s driving scoring plus the foul largest lead for Toronto at 10 and the Wolves struggling to get back in transition's been taking it out of the net Toronto's been running off of miscues and Miss shots one Kyle 2 Scottie Barnes with 13 points six rebounds again a 26-6 Advantage for the Raptors in Fast Break points right now it's Shake Milton Rudy Gobert Anthony Edwards Mike Conley and Kyle Anderson with the basketball mil try to thread the needle knocked out of bounds eight on the shot clock timber wolves with Justice we talked a lot about how deep this roster is just four bench points in this game so far from Minnesota Conley to work it in eight on the shot clock Toronto's doing what you should do against the second unit not always great shooting Kyle gets the put back first hoop for somebody off the bench from Minnesota Tano's just been back in the paint a lot of pressure making Minnesota have to make tough plays inside the three-point shooting has not been there the volume's not been there for sure they've only got 17 attempts in the game and they've only made four turnover and goldar turns it over Gary TRent Jr the steal he was trying to get it to Kyle Anderson Trent Jr the kick out and Anunoby can't hit slow-mo the rebound eight-point game quickly inside Gobert laying it in they would have called a goal 10 but the basket went in six point game 420 to go an eternity in this third quarter and Toronto calls timeout 420 to go in this third quarter wolves hanging around lot plays with Karl Anthony-Towns and the difference between help defense when Jakob Poetl steps up and when he doesn't so if he doesn't step up and commit you got to take the basketball to the rim and throw it down on his head so that was the bad attempt but this is the good one though Jakob Poetl commits the towns that's when the lob dunk is going to be there and it's just a read like Karl knows better than that but Jakob Poetl if he's not going to commit you got to be confident and just throw it down right on his head like you're supposed to so that was a bad sequence right there there were a number of bad towns Gobert plays that they'll connect on later on they're just trying to figure it out right now and give Toronto a lot of credit for what they've done here defensively putting pressure on Minnesota but those are anomalies they're going to clean that up let's check in with arcad storm Katie what was said in the Wolves huddle yeah transition defense it's a big Focus just like you guys have been talking about already of course they have the fast break Advantage the Toronto Raptors do so coach Finch the biggest thing he wants out of this group the message just now was not getting frustrated on the offensive end and letting that translate over to defense getting back getting ready K let's also see if this advantage that the wolves on paper have with the second unit makes a difference here the rest of this third quarter Naz reid out there with Kyle Anderson Shake Milton the two starters still on the floor Edwards and Gobert Siakam working on Edwards blocked stifled Tower with the swap under four to go in the third Edwards down the lane high off window no and Gobert fouled on the much smaller Malachi Flyn Bo he really been active tonight Pascal Siakam backing down an and Rudy comes from the weak side Patty Cakes off the glass Minnesota's Off to the Races and then he gets the offensive rebound and because he's down there fighting Malakai fin follows him Naz reid go first field goal of the night for Naz reid R go changed in the tener of this game was once a 10-point lead for Toronto is now down to four G Trent Jr pull up over Gobert no Milton the rebound good switch by Rudy that time and covering pass ahead Gobert couldn't handle it out of bounds it's been quite the effort to get the ball to Gobert he's been Rim running in this game it's it's it's one of the ways if he's going to score because you know one of the things that Chris Finch loved about Rudy during the exhibition season he never complained about shot attempts but one way that he's going to get shot at is if he runs the rim and he's been doing it consistently in this game Flynn deep three go it's good for Mali Flynn fourth year all with Toronto 7366 it's a big shot for Toronto stopping the Minnesota run Anderson downhill off last no Gobert is going to get called for an offensive foul perhaps a push p in the back going to be the third on Rudy Gobert Kyle trying to angle off Gary Trent can see the little push that time by Rudy Rudy deserves a break Town's going to come back in let's see if top Karl can maybe get some of the prer jump shooter working for him you just want to buy from outside the AR because only Ben the line in an and one situation so we've got the one free throw outside look Jalen McDaniels no and Edwards bringing it up he's played all but about three or three minutes or so in this ball game something to keep an eye on Edwards energy level a lot of minutes tonight he's played well pull up three good and with the big three he's up to 21 in game one looking good in number five Barnes trying to answer off the heel Milton on the attack kick out reid penetrating flipping it up and in big jelly with the deuce I think Naz likes playing out of the corners Chris Finch did not want to do that to Karl Anthony town just having him be spotted up in the corners but Naz is good you put him in the right or left corner good three-point shooter from the corners but more than anything else he has the ability to attack Closeouts and drive it out of the corners so he creates spacing as a big On the Floor Michael and it's it's an excellent thing to see and it's funny now his confidence continuing to grow he's doing a solid job of moving without the basketball as well where last year his feet were kind of in cement he was asked about that after one of the training camp practices and he says well I was nervous I I I didn't want to mess up so I just stood so I just stayed put he's moving a lot better wolves F get the wolves on your schedule with the flex plan Flex plans let you pick the games and seats you want for below single game prices visit timberwolves.com SL Flex for more info nice response by the Wolves after going down 10 yeah I really I really like it too you come back and make it a two-point game you got momentum Rudy was a part of that but Minnesota now making things happen Anthony Edwards gets a tough hoop now as reid makes something happen here and all of a sudden Minnesota's benches coming alive a little bit a lot of vets on this roster but game number one on the road takes a little time especially against a feisty physical team like Toronto to find that Rhythm FL driver blocked by towns Edwards wol don't have numbers Edwards wisely slows it up under 90 seconds to go in this third quarter Edwards penetrating finds oh in the corner Milton hitting the three Kyle Anderson with a nice pass in traffic finding Milton and guess who's back on top AA gives it up to Flynn wolves temporarily quieting this scoa Bank Crow land the Miss slowmo the rebound under a minute to go in the third Anderson over to reid in the corner three ball no a big lineup on the floor from Minnesota SM Jun off the heel Anderson the rebound Kyle playing the three a play in one basically because shake milon what a block Shake Milton is also at 65 he's got great size we're going to call a block here Kevin Scott with the call on the Baseline Shake tried taking it shake Milton called for the foul had a foul to give and yes he was sliding one-point ball game things heated up in the end of this third quarter Hua lost it out of bounds ninth turnover of the game for Toronto and the Wolves can hold for the final shot of the period that was pretty physical defense by Karl Anthony-Towns I I like that they're letting him play Minnesota's not gotten to the line hear much last part of this third quarter they're still on 20 attempts Edwards seven on the game clock working on Jalen McDaniels pull up Edwards short and that's how the third quarter comes to a close 4 Toronto this was the bucket that gave the Wolves the lead they trailed by 10 at one point in the third they lead by one headed to the fourth Sports is brought to you by Lexus experience amazing at your twin City's Lexus dealer and by Mayo Clinic official medical provider of the Timberwolves and your source for medical answers oh timble wolves trailed by 10 at the 529 Mark of the third quarter lead by one as the fourth quarter underway McDaniels on the drive kick out Barnes over to Trent Jr momentarily lost the handle six on the shot clock Barnes pull up at the free throw line good tough bucket I'm telling you that was master class that Kyle Anderson just put on defensively with there containing Scottie Barnes and when he made that shot Kyle was like got him got him shook his head all you can do Milt gives it over to reid spinning inside puts it up rattles out pass up ahead and Anunoby oh bully ball two St Wrong by Anunoby that's an offensive foul yes sir and Anunoby looks at Conley as Sayre floing oh that's complete offensive fou I mean like just put his shoulder into Mike's chest that's not a flop so a four time sportsmanship Man of the Year Award winner right there do that time BS takes the three partially deflected by Barnes and towns gets it back and throws it down great dish by Naz reid Karl's been good next to Naz it's not been as successful playing alongside Gobert but Barnes can't get that to fall Al Anderson playing right now without his glasses that he's been wearing through the summer and through the preseason so far towns if that was a shot or a pass either way it's a Turnal McDaniels nice bounce pass trent Jr lays it in Raptors taking advantage of Timber Wolf's mistakes Toronto by one Milton deep three no good and an noi in the lane and he's fouled by Karl Anthony-Towns that's going to be his second first team foul on the Wolves it's just not good body control that time by Karl he got a little bit out of position on the other end when the shot went up he crashed the offensive glass now he's behind the play comes back to Hell Mike but the the shot block attempt was just unnecessarily awkward awkward and violent do you know what I mean like it's too much he didn't need to foul in that situation he could have easily just blocked the shot cuz OG was completely flat footed let's get a message from Tria Health Partners for some of our patience the goal is winning a national championship but you just want tocate for State at Trio Orthopedics we'll treat you risk and get you back on the ice Anunoby hitting both free throws those little things matter just here they really do matter I mean just you just gave him two free throws and really you could have almost tied him up more than anything else you didn't even need to do all that you did to try snuff that shot it's okay you can get it back right here another big block Scottie bar in there pass ahead and no highlight D for the Raptors and it's a fivepoint game that's Toronto Raptor basketball in a nutshell right there a new arrow with dark oh r first game is head coach of the Raptors 60 Toronto run towns no call on the contact on the shot attempt quickly ahead Trent Jr deep three no good towns the board and we'll see if Conley can calm things down and set up a good look for Minnesota three minutes gone by in the fourth get the ball keep the ball in Mike's hand and Kyle's hand let them handle Finley matched up with pearl five on the shot clock three three on the shot clock turns inside gets the roll used every bit of the 24 seconds there quickly ahead p with the catch in traffic and throws it out of bounds Rudy Gobert checking in for Karl Anthony-Towns great block by Scottie Barnes that time Jakob Poetl plugging protecting the rim but Scottie Barnes gets the block and ignites the break both wolves big men with the double double tonight Conley right hand floater too strong tried to keep it alive and how about that steal Mcdaniels threw it right to Conley Raptors upset they set the shot clock to 24 instead of 14 and there's a ball don't lie sequence traveling violation Mike initially with that second shot attempt was just trying to keep them from Fast breaking kind of knock it out of bounds but then he controlled the basketball was able to save it was quite the play 12 turnovers for Minnesota Raptors with 12 points off of those turnovers bars flips it up and off Milton comes out of there with it Anthony Edwards will check in next dead ball for the Timberwolves he has 21 tonight over to Conley on a good Gobert screen reid trying to post up Trent Jr spins lot of contact at Barnes Taps it out of bounds with 6/10 of a second on the shot clock as Anthony Edwards checks back in short clock play on the Baseline out of bounds you better have something good here spacing issues on that possession got to get something to the rim it's been a long rest for Dennis Schroder and Pascal Siakam who check back in still get a catch and shoot here 610 of a second Anderson over to Edwards Beat the Clock remember that play ladies and gentlemen he did a great job of shutting the defense that time shooter was getting into his body he just got rid of him one-point ball game Edwards with 23 Scher to Anunoby in the corner big time three ball Anunoby four three corner of the night Edwards fortunately Milton caught it Edwards gets it back this has been a good match up with Anon noin fare short Raptors trying to add to a four-point game great Hands by Milton Anderson driving puts it up and in big bucket slow-mo over Schroder how about The Possession by Milton though to get takeen away from Toronto nailbiter in Canada wolves haven't won in this building in 19 years Raptor's turnover re goes up foul free throws coming opportunity to tie this one up at the charity stripe Timeout on the floor mil nice pass ahead to ra will go to the well tonight's Grant casino story of the game is kind of A Tale of Two Tales here one from Minnesota is Anthony Edwards and the way that he's produced in this game really did a great job in the first quarter of getting Minnesota back into the game but right now Anthony Edwards has not been an efficient scoring night he's got 23 in the game on 22 shot attempts but the fast break points for Toronto has been off the charts they've got 32 fast break points in this game bat offense has led to a lot of igniting of of Fast Break opportunities for the Toronto Raptors they taken advantage but through all of that Michael Minnesota's been able to hang in here azri levels the game up here at 84 so you got to give the Wolves a lot of credit for fighting this Toronto Raptor team who has put up a big time fight themselves been quite the game Don was well played but energetic and tough shrer for three he's making quite the debut here isn't he in a Raptor's uniform he's got 20 in the game he and OG have been money from outside the arc I mean they're combined eight of 16 from outside the ark been a big point of emphasis for the Raptors three-point shooting as Edwards turns it over 13th turnover for Minnesota talking to Jack Armstrong one of the great analysts here Elvin Williams does a great job but they've got two Jack Armstrong was saying if they can just be an average three-point shooting team with their defense and energy they can really compete in the Eastern Conference they think they're going to be not only a deep team but a team that's going to be over 500 after going 41 and 41 last year Siakam oh Gobert caught it at the peak croud booing they thought it was a goal oh it's a block party near save Dennis Schroder trying to raptors have 10 blocks in this game Minnesota has eight the action has been great Man Hands of three Pascal Siakam there's 12 points tonight but a huge bucket both teams exerting a lot of energy and it's a six-point ball game after backto back threes from the Raptors don't

multiple times tonight came in January of 2004 when Sam casselle with trell Sprewell and Kevin Garnett was suiting up for the Timberwolves four 50 to get their first win trailing by six in 19 years Schroder did a great job of giving him a legs of Rudy G taking away the roll made Minnesota reset outside looks hwns can't hit Edwards has the rebound puts it up off Trent Jr clears missed opportunities for Minnesota as slow as the third quarter took to play this fourth quarter has flown by Siakam trying to find the angle AA in the corner three on the shot clock a two up no another rebound for Edwards the bullet there 23 points 12 boards for Edwards great footwork by precious aw out of the corner that time Downs driving and scoring Karl Anthony-Towns 16 points in chin rebounds Edwards Gobert Anthony-Towns each with a double double for the first time in a regular season game Raptors turn it over three and a half to go in regulation and Milton is fouled by Gary Trent Jr just a second team foul on Toronto C so good moving to his left when that ball swings from the right side of the floor and hits him on that left lane line he is so good at driving to his left and kiss kissing it off the glass Minnesota almost needs to be perfect here down the stretch it's a four-point game but they cannot have empty sloppy possessions here Mike Conley is going to check back in here during this timeout Kyle Anderson back to Michael 328 to go four-point ball game let's listen to a message from TSR injury law hey wolves fans if you've been injured you know what time it is call us now and thank us later 612 TSR time can't wait to get Jalen McDaniels back into the mix to see how he is going to look with this group you're talking about another Toronto Raptors type player too that length that Shake brings to the mix to the the lengthy athleticism his ability to play in transition his ability to stretch the floor and take people off the dribble as well so that's going to be a welcomed addition when he comes back told the media earlier his individual goal for this season is to be defensive player of the year and it's that caliber of player that you're missing in the lineup tonight again he's dayto day with a calf injury so Kyle in the mix here with Mike Conley back on the floor Towns over to Anderson driving puts up the shot can't hit a cha comes out of there with it Schroder has been great tonight over to Siakam taking the three and rattling it home Pascal Siakam coming up big when it counts the two-time allstar up to 15 points it's just you're not used to seeing it you're not used to seeing Minnesota get out shot from outside the ark like this it's 14-6 Advantage swi Edwards the answer 14 to7 that's very timely stay within shooting range here just a four-point game still a lot of time left 230 to go here in this fourth quarter Schroder spinning pass Edwards the kick out to Anunoby pass to shrer who scores great ball movement from the Raptors 26 assists on their 35 field goals six-point game Edwards another three rolls out now it's Anunoby to AA blocked by Gobert is staying with it and now now eight more clock seven on the shot clock for schrudder Siakam another three no good Edward sky in there for the rebound RS will have to act quickly Edwards in the lane the floater blocked by Anunoby they get it back BS for three no and another rebound for Suter it's been that kind of night offensively for Minnesota his Toronto crowd rising to its feet Schroder no and now 65 seconds for the wolves Anderson push side too strong got it back and scores 55.5 it's a four-point game fourpoint game oh my gosh you're going to look back at how many possessions you're going to kick yourself this is going to be a good film for Chris Finch to have a lot of lessons learned five on the shot clock Schroder weaving around traic air ball you'd like to learn those lessons by winning this ball game and pling clutch down the stretch and the Wolves turn it over at a critical moment and Barnes takes his time scores missed opportunities poor decisions and the Raptors taking advantage 97 91 with 19.2 to go and this is another one of those regrettable sequences spacing issues Karl trying to dump it down inside and another fast break opportunity for Toronto 34 fast break points is it's pretty astounding and then you Lop on top of that all the three-point shooting well the disparity 14-7 doubling Minnesota up from outside the ark those two areas huge tonight you mentioned 14 three-pointers for the Raptors and also the fast break points they just added to it with that dunk by Scottie Barnes the other thing too 34-2 advantage in Fast Break yeah the other thing too is that Toronto's completely cleaned up the fing situation Minnesota had 20 free throw attempts at halftime the bulls have only shot two freee throws here in the second half our American Family Insurance dream fearlessly player of the game Anthony Edwards 26 points 12 of those coming in the first quarter scor scored the first 10 points of the ball game 14 rebounds tonight 17th career double double for Anthony Edwards con gets it into towns Edwards look at a three in the corner missed everything towns battling for the board out of bounds it will stay with Minnesota 11.5 on the game clock and Chris Finch will call another timeout we'll keep it here after the ball game The Wolves will return home couple of days off before the home opener at Target Center against the Miami Heat which will be another big ball game again a season ago it was two games against San Antonio two games against the Spurs one game against the Jags relatively easy on SK on paper schedule this this one a little different yeah and the defending Eastern Conference Champion Miami Heat come to town on Saturday fly to Atlanta to take on the Hawks host the defending Champion Denver Nuggets on November 1st then it's the Utah and a team that possibly the favorite to come out of the Eastern Conference either them or Milwaukee the Boston Celtics on November 6th yeah I mean and it keeps going from there too by the way because you got the after that the Spurs of Wy after that you got the Warriors twice on the road the Suns after that so we can keep on going because there are no easy nights there are no easy nights in the NBA as you mentioned the film session will not be pretty tomorrow no after this one and this is a unique physical Toronto Raptors team we know what they bring defensively Scottie Barnes with the career high five blocks tonight just a lot of offensive blows and tough decision making in terms of taking care of the basketball Conley firing missing Gobert has it over to towns firing scoring 3/10 of a second left and it'll be too little too late tears from this Scotia B Arena crowd the drought in Toronto continues 19 straight losses in this building for Minnesota the pain continues here in Toronto I really thought that they were going to be able to rewrite the narrative starting tonight but you got to give this young Raptors team a lot of credit they came out here and they played a whale of a game they punched Minnesota in the mouth and they kept on punching and it's game one of 88 two it doesn't start pretty three-point loss 97 994 the final for Jim Peterson ktie storm I entire Valley Sports crew here in Toronto
