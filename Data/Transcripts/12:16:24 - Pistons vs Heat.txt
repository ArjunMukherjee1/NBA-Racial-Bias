 on this mild 50 degree mid December night in Detroit Michigan the heat is on FanDuel Sports Network tonight the heat take on the Detroit Pistons for the third time this season each team has won a game at home the heat by six in late October and then they lost by two points in overtime here in a mid November heartbreak we do hope you enjoy every bounce and basket of the rematch right along with us the Heat come into this game a season best three games above 500 they have the longest active winning streak in the Eastern Conference and in those four straight wins Miami scoring nearly 123 points per game and making over 16 triples a game during the win streak look inside the Little Caesars Arena thank you for joining us for tonight's edition of Monday Night basketball you know the point guard John CR I agreed we've all enjoyed these four straight wins over the Lakers Suns Cavaliers and Raptors and Jun right now the heat are playing their best stretch of basketball here in season number 37 and the point guard has three keys to four straight wins yeah let's start with the phase one that I think really jumps off the page and that's the offense playing faster sharing the basketball getting it out in transition having numbers using the pass or the dribble to advance the basketball and just getting quality easy scores around the rim as a result next it's been disruptive defense aggressive on the ball deflections and steals allowing Miami to get out with numbers in that transition game to score the ball and then the bench they've made an impact Dru Smith Terry Rozier niik Jovic and H Jaquez Jr have all given Miami a depth and pop off that bench and that second unit that they really needed John here are some other Papa John's key ingredients the four straight wins have come by an average of 17 1 12 points for game solid shooting at 52% 16 made threes a game and how about this plus nine rebounds a game on the winning streak either are 7 and0 this year when they do have a rebound advantage and of course it does help when you have a Herro on your team yeah Tyler Herro Miami's most dynamic scores in a great Rhythm over these last four games 26 points a game and the percentages that he's shooting at 60 and Beyond The Arc such a high level had a season High 40 points against this Detroit team back uh in November this guy can really get it done had 10 threes here during that 40-point explosion and Johnny had 18 of those 40 points in the fourth quarter tonight game three between these two teams the home team won the first two Miami by eight in late October at home when they held the Pistons to 39% shooting and scored 21 points off turnovers and you must remember the overtime Heartbreaker here on the 12th of November despite Hero's 40-point game the Pistons win in overtime they controlled the boards especially on the offensive end through the first two games and John they were LED in both games by their emerging 23-year-old star Cade Cunningham he's a talented player Cade Cunningham in his fourth season's got great size at 66 they're using him as both a playmaker and a shot maker he can really shoot the basketball out Beyond The Arc that's been a big step for him this year at 38% he's third and assists in the league and over nine a game um you know one of the things he does incredibly well is we score at The Rim using that size and has that Vision but he is tur over prone if Miami can pressure him double team him at times he will turn the basketball over that's Detroit Center Jalen Duren he missed the last game with a spraying wrist he's back tonight he had 11 rebounds in both games against the Heat his dunk off an inbounds pass with just over a second left in overtime one it for the Pistons and hard for Heat fans to forget on the other side of the Ledger there's Miami Center bam Adebayo he is the Catalyst four straight double doubles in the four-game win streak heater 11 and three this year when their two-time gold medalists strikes NBA gold with double doubles and on this mild Monday in the city of Detroit the he will try to extend their winning streak to a fifth streak iname guarantee call now to learn more by your local Toyota dealers Toyota Let's Go Places and by FPL working for you you every single day your Lexus starting lineups for the he you see that 8-2 record look at those five guys they have been one of the most effective and impactful starting groups this season in the NBA Jimmy Butler missed the game here in Detroit he did have 23.7 assists four steals in the heat Victory back in late October against the Pistons Jimmy is ready to go playing some of his best basketball this season over the last 10 games heer without Jovic Carson and Jay Rich they're all back home dealing with their respective injuries Tobias Harris he's a guy that averages 14 points per game for them the veteran out of Tennessee does so many things his spot in their starting lineup will be assumed by the second year forward Ausar Thompson Thompson playing in just his seventh game this year uh he'll make his second start that's the guy that leads their Lexus starting group Cade Cunningham was the first pick back in the 2021 NBA draft this fourth year pro at Oklahoma State John 66 220 averages 24 points nine assists seven rebounds again this man flirts with triple doubles nightm yeah he's really impressive player become a very well-rounded player too his ability to shoot the ball with range from 38% from three it's been a big jump for him and really forc defenses to come out to guard him and he's been able to get to that drive game nice Vision great size at 66 to be able to pick apart the defense and throw passes over the top Malik Beasley also getting a start tonight for the Pistons his eighth start this season he's a sharpshooter our officials are Curtis player Andy Nagi and in Wang now this the late edition of the schedule and an embarrassingly small crowd here at the Little Caesars Arena tip controlled by the heat off we go with or without the fans here in Detroit on another Miami Heat NBA adventure maybe they're stuck in traffic John who knows Cunningham matching up against Jimmy Butler Duncan on the Move gets a step on hardyway Jr and the lot broken up that was a nice defensive play by Thompson he can run the floor but he missed on the Finish Duren could not save it in so John right from the opening possession Miami reminder this a quick athletic and fast Pistons Club super reactive too the way they were able to get to that lob and then translate it from defense to offense this team will really really uh play very hard and they'll play incredibly athletic and Ausar Thompson starts the night defending Herro he does switch to Robins Herro gets fouled by Tim Hardaway Jr 12th year man out of Michigan the son of Hall of Fame Heat point guard Tim Hardaway senior it's hard to guard T Tyler Herro that far from the basket he's so good with the basketball Tim Hardaway Junior um well outside the three-point line trying to stifle Tyler pons have lost three of their last four at home they're six under the 500 Mark for the year that's a triple for bam his 23rd three of the Season he is knocking him in on a regular basis from downtown well just you know opportunistically looked forward doesn't have to be a huge part of his Arsenal and uh right there they're playing so far off and they he just stepped right into it Cunningham pitching out to Beasley and that's what he does best Beasley the ninth year pro at of Florida shate 93 triples for him yeah that's a a huge part of his game over 40% he typically comes off the bench oh that was bad defense by Thompson but Herro missed the open three this is Jalen Duren the big young fell Duren in his third season out of Memphis Thompson oh Herro went down shot is down to five here's Beasley Good Help by B Beasley stuck it anyway Malik Beasley with the Pistons first five points of the game yeah tough pullup shot there for beatley again he's he tends to be their spark coming off the bench but with some of the injuries they've had with Tobias Harris he has been inserted into that starting lineup he's out there really to provide some long range shooting this is a pretty poor outside shooting team with the exception of himself and Cunningham that's sits out also not starting tonight Jaden Ivy the third year point guard out of Purdue he had been a starter All Season we two minutes in Pistons with a two-point lead bam Sur makes a contested shot right on Duren great attack by bam and that's what he needs to do move the big man around he's got the foot speed Advantage face him up tack him off the dribble so bam has the Heats first five points as hard Jor drops in a three Timmy with 41 triples this year he's averaging just under 10 points per game for the Pistons and yes his dad Tim Hardaway sen is in the building of course he's streaky out there Tim Jr he can make him in bunches dun driving in runs under a pack of defense and Thompson with the takeway and he loses it to Bam and Bam got fouled by the big man Jalen Duren his first and the Pistons third team foul here in the quarter like the persistence by Duncan Robinson didn't give up on the ball when he fumbled it and lost it there initially on the slap away continues to go after the ball this extra effort creates the deflection and the finish here by bam able to go to the line so three fouls and three minutes on this Detroit team that has struggled recently on the defensive end and their first year head coach JB bicker staff who is hired on the 3rd of July L than two weeks after he was let go by the Cleveland Cavaliers he established himself as a very good coach there and now he's trying to build something different here John remember the the disaster of last season just 14 wins the NBA's worst record and second worst home record they've missed the playoffs and finished under 500 five straight years it's a a massive job to turn it around it really is it's he's he's a good man for it but to your point earlier this team was six best defensive rating through the first 15 games they holding teams to 110 points or less last 11 games 27 and 117 points a game so they've really fallen off there that's led to the more losing p with first seven points for the heat as Cade Cunningham gets on the scoreboard for the first time tonight that young man so talented out of Arlington Texas Herro on the move for the F first bucket great attack there by Tyler those drives will set up his jump shooting game later here as we proceed first turnover of the game for Cunningham and here comes Duncan Robinson now Herro sets for the this is Hardaway Jr with 8 and2 minutes left in the first he'll F and hit and 32 years old now 12 years into his NBA career he grew up in Miami when his dad was playing for the heat went to palto Senior High Butler on the glass for two good hard take there by Jimmy with the right hand uses the backboard as well as anybody in the league with the touch John he's so officient fewer shots in his last 11 Seasons yet he's shooting a career high 55% ponio missed it Duren Smith for Big Man Duren you can't get baited and overc commit on the drives because the backboard is wide open for that guy to come in with those offensive footb backs tians have hit six of their first eight shots Herro down the runway blocked by Duren helps to have a basket protector like Jalen Duren Cunningham Coast to Coast plusy I'm Duncan Robinson they say Duncan was on the restricted line here in one opportunity for Cade Cunningham great block that's a late commitment there after Tyler took off watch the feet oh I don't know I don't know outside that restricted area he didn't look like he was moving early in the game for Coach SPO to burn a challenge but J that's what the Pistons do off their defense that time they coming downhill as an attacking team led by Cade Cunningham they have a six-point lead here in the first quarter as Herro streaks in and finds B Dru Smith the first Sub in for the heat finds the cutting Robinson who rolls it off and Duren comes down with the Pistons rebound he's already got four boards and a block here's Cunningham oh he went right through Dru Smith and that is not easy to do now six early points for Cade Cunningham and the game's first timeout goes to Miami with a distance jumping in front by eight Cade Cunningham getting to that spin using that size leaning on Dru Smith pistons on top by eight TR the category would be best set up men in the NBA this year but Trey young has the Hawks playing well young healing over it dozen assist for G Nico Jovic the in VP over and over again and he's setting up teammates over and over again almost tenesis per game for the most versatile big man in the game and there's the Pistons young guard only 23 years old Cade Cunningham in his fourth season John the guy's gotten better every year he's already got 12 double doubles and five triple doubles this year yeah a very talented young man and this guy right here is turnover prone though averages a league High 4.2 turnovers a game Cade Cunningham so want to pressure him try to double team him at times and he will cough it up Pistons have made eight of their first 10 shots to open this eight-point lead Jimmy working against Cunningham Dru Smith one a shot caught for bam and Cunningham down with a defensive rebound for the Pistons now Dru Smith brought in they try to slow down Cunningham oh The Cutting Hardaway Junior Bobble it Dru Smith with the steel now the heat turn over the Pistons for the fourth time here in the first quarter that's Duncan kab Duncan Robinson three-pointer number one the night number 55 this season I love how he cleared himself there with that Dribble To the left he's got such a high arc great wrist action on that fou through Tim Hardaway Jor missing from downtown bam clears the glass for the heat but Dru Smith not only getting big minutes he getting some of the game's most important minutes through this winning streak just does a lot of positive things without having to touch the ball a long period of time her off glass for two more John his touch on the move is so good that is a hard shot ladies and gentlemen with a seven-footer Duren lurking around as a shop blocker you're going Full Tilt Tyler able to stop right on the on the butt there and put something up soft with that left hand Thompson Rings up a triple that's a D Thompson started 38 games last year and then his season ended with blood CRS shut him down last year in the first part of this year pistons in front by six Dru Smith will fire a three and barrier Dru Smith that's his 11th three-pointer this season this is his 11th game of the season had to come over to Jimmy Jimmy got stuck up against that sideline or the end line there he's got to be careful about over penetrating against this athletic team and getting pinned on that Baseline nice one dribble side step for Hardaway Jr but Herro comes down with it going against Simone fontecchio here's Duncan they left him alone that's a dangerous game to play with a shooter as good as Robinson they were fortunate there miscommunication breakdown defensively pono's pass picked off by B Adebayo the pitch for Herro and off the pump fake he'll get busy for The Cutting Butler for the dunk and there you see the decisionmaking process for Tyler Herro finding Butler a chance at a three-point play that's an excellent pass from the perimeter there by Tyler Herro his decision making continues to be so high level look at the ball fake no look finds Jimmy cting and there's the contact during late trying to get to that shot blocking opportunity and Butler already on top of the basket with the two-hand crush that is the second personal foul on Jalen Duren he's going to come out of the game for Isaiah Stewart as JB picker staff will make that move with four and a half minutes left here in the first quarter Duncan Robinson will sit for the heat Jaime Jaquez Jr comes in for miam and Kevin Love has replaced Ben Jimmy but in the win streak Johnny shooting 59% in the last four games just amazing how efficient he is and getting to that free throw line as well and JB picker St wants a timeout for the Pistons Miami was down by six I have reduced that deficit to a single Vision gloves with Dru Smith has brought to the Heat this year and just his instincts are so good it's making the right play every time right read on the offensive end tough hard noosed defense on the defensive and picking up the one of the best perimeter players always and pressuring that ball Malik Beasley knocks in that three Beasley already with eight points he's tripled twice Beasley has made all three of his shots yeah he's a catch and shoot guy out there Beyond The Arc got a close to him anticipate that he's going to take a shot even if you're on him with the hand in his face nice cut by Butler he lost coming him but could not finish it he does get it back Herro surrounded with a shot clock at four that's live and here comes Ausari Thompson he's got fontecchio ahead with him Oh my he hung on the rim and it's going to be a late blocking foul against Dru Smith wow that was Sky walking but I thought Smith had some decent position we're going to take another look here this is serious skywalking Smith has the absolute position there too coach spoke questioning the call here he was not in the circle boy Thompson a high flyer Sor Thompson fifth pick in the 2023 NBA draft he him and his brother amen Thompson first two brothers to go in the top five of an NBA draft in NBA history remember they're both from Oakland California they left uh Oakland and came to high school at Pine Crest in South Florida they both left after their junior year of high school to join overtime Elite now they're both in the NBA a men playing really well for the Houston Rockets five-point lead for the Pistons HZ gave up the three drives in and Cashes in HZ reading defense going to the strong part of his game beautiful seam open up for him and he just is such a good straight line driver able to get all the using that left hand Beasley threw it right into the seats that's the fifth turnover in the quarter on the Pistons changes for both teams Terry Rozier comes in for Miami Cade Cunningham and Ausar Thompson SI for the Pistons Marcus Sasser is in for for Detroit and so is Ron Holland the 19-year-old rookie out of Duncanville Texas who's coming off his best game of the season there he is had a 26-point game last Thursday against the South a three-point Pistons lead Here Comes Jimmy oh he found a wide open Dru Smith for a layup five points for Smith in the probing one of the highest IQ players to ever play for the Miami Heat Jimmy Butler yeah Butler getting downhill four assists for Jimmy already finding Dru Smith oh nice driving shot made by the 23-year-old Isaiah Stewart comes off their bench backs up Duren he's a good backup yeah has great energy always rebounds the ball so effectively for them coming off that bench that's a rare bu turnover Ron Holland coast to coast and Holland could not control it here comes HZ Butler makes the catch deep in the corner Kaboom 10th three-pointer of the season for Butler he has seven first quarter points to go along with his four assists Quick Pitch ahead by Jaime Jaquez Jr getting Jimmy Butler that comfy Corner triple ties the game at 28 that's Holland who unties it quickly round Holland only shooting 20% from downtown this year just 12 three of his rookie Seasons this is Hawkins poing up on Holland ducking in and Holland pulls him down and we're going to get a jump onall Ron Holland showing you some toughness on the defensive end not easy to Def than HZ with all those low post moves HZ had a good strong move here looked like he just lost control of the ball off his left hand yeah on the replay you can see it and then gets tied up Holland and Jaquez Jr are going to jump this one up shot clock is at nine at the heat control minute 54 left first quarter Holland at 68 HZ at 66 and the Pistons win the ti this is Marcus Sasser seconde guard out of Houston Isaiah Stewart posting Love and missing on the jump hook and a good defensive board for Kevin Love three-point Pistons lead love against vonia gets deep and gets two power game right there taking fio to the Woodshed Kevin Love right there good strong move on the interior and that 16 paint points for the heat in this quarter Stewart gets two in the paint is Stewart out of Rochester New York's McQuade Jesuit High School a three-point Pistons lead with under a minute left in a quarter HZ brought the ball with him and had it wiped out by Stewart it's a go t Jaime HZ with a the ball handling and the spin move for his second bucket heat within a point they have trailed by as much as eight in this first quarter Pistons have made 13 of their 19 shots that's 68% first quarter shooting for Detroit here's Beasley on a pull out and Butler pulls it down Jimmy butter attempting his second three here in the first quarter it's a two for one opportunity for Miami quick shot 10c differential give them one more possession now Sasser on the handle Dru Smith defending five on the shot clock Stewart threw it too high over the head of Holland that's six first quarter turnovers for Detroit that's a big Achilles heel of this team they really turn the basketball over at a high level and it just shoots them in the foot something coach JB bicker staff has acknowledged and says they're trying to work on but you know those really uh deflate you six turnovers right now Miami's been able to score nine points off this turnover P's a team that has lost four their last five games love missing that good looking throw here comes a sari that's Sasser and from behind Rose here able to poke it out of bounds good transition defense and you better have your transition defense ready to go against this speedy and young Pistons can a tenth of a second left in the quarter and that'll end the first quarter good offensive period for both teams Pistons shoots 65% the he get seven points from Jimmy and bam 3 here's a good look at your item of the game tonight by one get won 50% off heat culture jerseys and shorts that's a great time to give the gift of heat during the holiday season scan the QR code to purchase and join the crew Crow and Reed stimulating the economy as we would say at the Miami Heat store at G good representation right there always Motor City with plenty of members of heat Nation look at that the Moon Over Miami Hey guys you're on TV get off the phone welcome back here at the Little Caesars Arena sparsely filled we start the second quarter with Miami trailing out of p with the rebound with a Heat trailing by a point 33- 32 Duncan on a pull up and the rebound comes down Isaiah Stewart so the so the Pistons in the first quarter turnover prone but they shot really well they were six of eight from downtown and each team taking their turn giving it back to the oven he's going with Rozier Highsmith Jaquez Adebayo and Robinson to start the second quarter pons have beas Holland Stewart Cunningham and Fontecchio heat three games above 500 fifth place right now in the East Ron Holland Duncan gets over the screen Stewart for three and Highsmith coming down to help his teammate great J rebound there all three red jerseys around that ball Duncan using the pump fake to get free but missing the three Robinson just one for five to start the game from downtown Ro has chicken with Cunningham out to Beasley dangerous shooter he's just getting way too much space out there tur here got lost on defense trying to help on Cunningham and Beasley able to slip loose he's already converted three for three Beyond The Arc has 11 points in 11 minutes he started the game tonight for them by the way Jaden Ivy who has been a starter in their backward a late scratch with a sewer name just got word from the Pistons PR staff about that this is Beasley bottled up by Duncan Robinson he draws the foul and right now is former Florida State seol at Alpharetta Georgia he is lighting up the heat here in the first half Robinson picks up the foul that's number two on Duncan look get free throws for the Pistons Malik Beasley and a word from star easy music to my ears you don't have ears star it's different Beasley was the 19th pick in the 2016 NBA draft spent his first three and a half years with Denver then three years with the Timberwolves a season with Utah little bit of time with the Lakers and then last year with the bucks he's on his second straight one-year deal it's a pretty good player to have bounced around that much yeah I think this is uh been a real good fit for him he's become more consistent as an outside shooter and I think uh you know that's what's allowing him to perform at this level he typically comes off the bench he's one of been one of the best bench shoo this season thus far pressed into that starting lineup here with some of the injuries and that Detroit's experienced soft shooting touch for B Adebayo he's been quietly efficient tonight with nine points the Heat trailing by four as Stewart goes to work in the low post this is Holland now fio blocked by Jaquez but a foul on Highsmith his first the heat second foul of the quarter mention that the heater fifth in the East JN it's so tightly packed Miami is 510 of a percentage Point ahead of the Bucks both Miami and Milwaukee a game ahead of Atlanta and a game and a half behind both the magic and the Knicks so three through through six and seven tightly packed that's why every game has significance pistons on the other hand 11th in the east relas here a half game behind Brooklyn at number 10 and and I mentioned that because remember top 10 you're you're a top 10 team you are a playin team and the Pistons would certainly like a little bit of that F teum getting his first two points the native of Italy in his third NBA season Pistons with a six-point lead Rozier nice pitch for Jaquez oh he needs a three to drop is thirsty from three-point line right now Fontecchio line drive home run Fontecchio a little fivepoint spre for him and the Pistons increase their lead to nine this is their biggest lead of the game at 43- 34 roir rejected by Isaiah Stewart this is Cunningham stripped and looks like they're going to get Highsmith on a reach in now St down it looked like he was grabbing that left knee on the Collision he's looking to try to get up right now oh that does not look good for Isaiah aggressive attack here by Terry Rozier and there's the contact looked like he hyperextended that left knee a bit yes really P down on it and buckled yeah walking off which is a good sign but not good going to the locker room Isaiah Stewart guy that started 45 games last year he started four games this season average of six points six rebounds again and he comes out for Jalen Duren the Pistons have opened up a 10-point lead three minutes into this second quarter and who's going to get this ball Andy naggie says Pistons keeping another look at what happened to Stewart here from up above watch the left leg on when it comes back down to the ground right there oh that is not the way your knee is supposed to go Isaiah we feel your pain brother HZ with a steal of Cunningham's in down pass that's seven Detroit turnovers Holland getting back on the defensive there m Cade Cunningham couple of turnovers tonight Cunningham Trey young and James Harden tell you what they have in common two things all skilled highly skilled offensive players they commit the most turnovers per game in the league all three of them at 4.6 a night now some of it comes from high usage but nobody wants a turnover number that high here maneuver that's Rose and Bam hunts it down iith finds HZ and the foul HZ finding the basket he'll go to the strike with six points that's a great cut from the top of the key Haywood Highsmith could make the first pass you're going to see bam dive cut here Here Comes Highsmith on the rebound opportunity from bam and hwz from the top of the circle right down the gut and that's just perfect timing and really unselfish Miami's done that very well they've made the extra pass they've spread the floor and cut to the open areas cohesive and efficient so far the heat 11 assists on their first 15 scores already 20 points in the pen and Jaquez does complete the three-point play he had a couple good games already against the Pistons this year having another one tonight eer down by seven HZ with seven Rozier switches off to Cade Cunningham well he actually in a two3 zone defense right now Cunningham from the top knocks it in so comfortable out there with Range High pick and roll action got to close up much closer to him very comfortable out there as a 38% three-point shoot that's his first triple tonight he has nine points 10-point lead again for Detroit that's foul on Ausar Thompson that'll be his second and that's the second team foul in the quarter on the Pistons yeah they they're greatly improved at 10 and 16 through 26 games last year John they were two and 24 they went through a 28 game losing streak last year here's Herro driving in on Thompson to strip the ball clean that's a great takeway by Young assur Thompson going Coast to Coast but no finish that's frustrating for that young man here's Rozier on the move and it's an offensive foul on Terry Tim Hardaway Jr learn to play the game in South Florida watching his dad in the heat that's a solid play by Junior like I like the hard take and the push ahead here by Tyler but Terry's got to pull up and shoot that bank shot there got a little too aggressive going to the basket Tim Hardaway Jr really good read and and had the angle there to dogar remember the last time we were here he took that hard fall hurt his head missed a couple games we ran into him before the game he says he's fine now oh a throw away there by Thompson Here Comes HZ with coming in that's pretty good transition defense by gunningham A's got trapped under the rim and what do we have here a turnover on the Pistons for a double dribble so nine first half turnovers for the Pistons heat with 12 points off the nine turnovers Pistons have not scored a single point off Miami's four turnovers but check that box with a heat yeah Miami's down by 10 he'd only have five points in the quarter bam under duress that's a fourth shot that he missed Here Comes Cunningham on the L and Thompson slams it through Eric spula knows that is the pissin at their best he takes a timeout to slow their roll Detroit with its biggest lead of the first half Cade Cunningham leading the break and Thompson finishing it well that Wing Cuts hard super out athletic Detroit right now on the Run 11 to2 as they're closing this quarter points right now in the Fast Break game one dribble after the pass and the pitch ahead to Thompson they are getting down quick and beating Miami back down the floor that are allaround performers touch on Cade Cunningham what he's been able to do both scoring assisting and rebounding with some of the best in the association they talk about him in Detroit like we talk about Tyler Herro in Miami guy that deserves to be an Eastern Conference allar but those Wing perimeter spots coveted especially in the East yeah so competitive with that group a lot of candidates by the way a 16 to5 run to open this second quarter by the pistols the heat just two of 11 from the field in this quarter they've missed all four of their threes in the quarter Dru Smith tries r and during comes down with a rebound he needs some answers on both ends of the floor right now because they're giving up 63% shooting on this end I'd love to see some stops and I'd like to see the team get Tyler the ball in some positions he can score Thompson's done a really good job oneon-one and Tyler has not been able to get anything coming off the screen or create any space it's it's really been on him having to try to create everything on his own scored 40 when we were here last in mid November 18 of the those 40 came in the fourth quarter when he tripled six times seemed like he had the game one and until it went the other way 12o Detroit lead 6 and a half to play here in the second quarter that's sassin yikes Marcus assassin only his 15th triple of his second season his first points tonight it extends the Pistons lead to 15 now 52- 37 another double teaming Jimmy Butler on the post as well Herro knocks in a three that was much needed for Tyler his 97th triple this season and he extends his streak to 58 consecutive games with at least one Splash that gives him the second longest three-point shooting streak in heat history tring only Duncan Robinson that was a 34f footer he had to shoot though that's how hard it's been for Tyler to get an open shot out his serious range heat forcing the Pistons into a 10th first half turnover B got a trying to rescue it could not oh sorry Thompson and Bam continue to scrap Dru Smith to the floor bam with a deflection what a sequence and then a foul on Dru Smith got two teams here in this Monday night mid December playing their heart job right now boy going down to the floor bam if he doesn't do that it's a runaway layup for Thompson it's a crazy sequence here both teams playing hard B makes this play otherwise Thompson runs away Smith on the ground there was like an NBA version of a fumble recovery for the Pistons Dru Smith picks up the foul for Smith his first foul of the game actually second foul on Dru Smith Rozier and Adebayo leave the lineup Kevin Love is back in so is Highsmith and Butler with 537 left here in the second quarter he trailing by 12 they down by 15 a moment ago young Ausar Thompson operating against he Smith looks smooth that's seven points for this former Broward County co-player of the year with his twin brother amen they did that together at Pine Crest where they won the class 4A state championship oh Dru Smith missed on the move but they're able to tip it home nine points for Jimmy Smith locking in on Marcus assassin now Duren off the Jump hook on Herro missed it twice and height Smith reels it in Butler imma post joh Beasley draws the foul and maybe before the shot the foul is on Beasley is second of the game check it is first of the game Jimmy very underrated as a rebounder averages five a game but gets on that offensive board in traffic right hand tip in there and the quick Attack Mode here draws the foul they're going to wave it off and say it's not a shooting foul he wasn't gathered in the act of shooting it'll be side out Miami 13 foul on the pons Jimmy Butler this is Caleb and Butler has it back oh manipulating his way through the defense Jimmy Butler with two straight scores he has 11 the heat within 10 good hard drive by Jimmy rejected the screen there went on his own to the Baseline oh Beasley got away with stepson Butler knocked it free knocked it right out of the hands of Beasley the 11th Detroit turnover see what it turns into Butler gets back and the heat will parade to the free throw stripe here off some real solid heat defense getting disruptive is what this heat defense has done 11 turnovers now but this is Jimmy in the offensive end rejects the screen Little Euro Step all the way through to the rim and then active hands here look at this able to get to the body and draw the foul again Butler has taken only one free throw the these will be his second and third he's had two straight games with eight free throw attempts Jimmy ranks fourth and in the NBA this year averages 7 and 1 half free- throw attempts per game he's in the top 20 in field goal percentage J something that goes relatively unnoticed for him 10th best assist turnover ratio in the league almost 3.3 to1 3.3 assist every one turnover it's amazing there are the attempts on your screen and you know that is something that really get you points every night when you're struggling to score uh but he is truly one of the most efficient players um in the league particularly as a star CU most most of the stars in this league shoot a lot of shots and take a lot of bad shots he's only taking 11 shots a game he been really efficient in getting that L bad fall for Highsmith Hardaway Junior missing the Triple during with love and Look Out Below he almost brought the basket down Mighty Jalen Duren here's Herro for three Cunningham comes back for the Pistons look out Holland on the reverse five points for Holland the Pistons lead is back to a dozen they got 14 fast break points in this half Jimmy powering his way back to the free throw strike Butler six straight points for Miami he's earning every one of them Cade Cunningham on the break and looking right over top of the defense finds that cutter and that's Holland from the left side and this is why he's third in the league in assists he's got great vision I think that size at 66 helps him really see over top a lot of Defenders and he's got eight assists already here in the first half average is just over nine a game Tim Hardaway Jr picking up his third foul he will come out of the game for Marcus Sasser Jimmy Butler last 10 games 21 points on 61% shooting he's only committed eight foul Sean in the last 10 games guy is so physical and so smart such a unique set of skills for for Jimmy Butler now his 14th NBA season his six with the heat it's a six time allar and constantly reminds you with his play how good he is good offensive foul call there Duren had a handful of Kevin Love Jersey on that push off there love to see a replay of that just look at him contesting watch the right hand of Duren just grabbing Kevin Love's Jersy that is a big strong physical dude at 610 250 lbs but he's going to sit down right now with his third personal foul and in comes Paul Reed who's had a very interesting last couple of days for for the piss they waved him two days ago they resigned them before the game a butler he's binging here in the quarter Jimmy Butler got 17 points on six of eight shooting he has 10 points here in the fourth in the second quarter and he's down eight that's Sasser short and the rebound 11 Butler sparking a Miami comeback here didn't get the foul that time here comes Cunningham nice pass Reed Maneuvers and misses and love looking deep for Butler that's a heat touchdown Jimmy Butler with a 12-point quarter and a 19point half how about that Vision though and just the the knowledge that Jimmy would be open right away cuz he was late getting back Kevin Love with that Quick Pass makes an easy two points for Jimmy Butler just over two minutes left in the half the wraparound pass by Beasley picked off by Butler and that's the 13 Pistons turnover Miami right now on a 12 to four r on there within six points Here Comes Dru Smith put on the brakes sets up his man Kevin Love for the layup the love gets his second score Miami is within four points what a run a 14 to four answered back run by Miami led by Jimmy Butler who's done everything including a touchdown reception here in the Motor City thank you guys Amy Isaiah Stewart done for the night that hyperextended left knee we'll s set him out for the rest of this game and Miami right now on the move a 14 to four run 12 of the 14 points in the Run scored by Jimmy Butler so puts more on the plate for bmer Philadelphia 76er Paul Reed who's originally from Orlando went to high school in a popka Florida he spent the first four years of his career with the 76ers they waved him in July he got released in a salary cap transaction a day or two ago and then they resigned him today the Topsy Turvy world for some in the NBA yeah it really is I like what he brings to the to the game and they need him tonight with Stewart out now with a hyperextended left knee uh they need somebody else in that front Court to provide some depth he's also got some some quickness and is not as U you know big and strong as as Duren Dru Smith with the shot clock down the five Butler in a tangle right there with young Marcus sassy and this looks like it's foulon Sasser number one on him Pistons are over the limit and guess who's going back to the stripe for his sixth and seventh free throws of the half Jimmy with a very engaging 12-point quarter a 19point first half for him yeah this is been a huge half for him and he'd have needed every bit of it but Tyler not not having his typically explosive first half he's only got seven points points and uh Duncan Robinson one for five shooting so needed some Firepower along with ice Smith who hasn't taken a shot yet in that starting lineup it's really been Jimmy Butler um and B you you say it and Jimmy Butler feels it and plays it that way he knows his team needs it to be a scorer tonight so that's what he's doing a 21-point first half for but 14 of those 21 in this quarter iing down by four minute 18 left in the half Paul Reed looking for a dribble handoff now dumps it for Fontecchio six on the shot Cline uhoh a sar Thompson came flying through the BN door for that one he is maybe the most athletic player on the court right now this guy is flying around wow what a cut and finish only 21 years old apparently already has his pilot's license look like an astronaut look like one of those drones been flying around John here's Heisman out of the corner a rainbow triple for Haywood Highsmith that's Haywood's first score of the night on his first field goal attempt of the game and it cuts the deficit to three 33 seconds left in the half Bonia step back 20f footer no and Butler with a rebound for the heat now Jimmy 21 points five assists four rebounds shot clck down the seven for B now it's in the hands of Jimmy ban for three and Dru Smith with a reach in foul so Dru Smith picking up that late foul it's going to be his third foul here at the end of the half oh and that's a tough one because the heater in the bonus you see coach SPO and it's going to Detroit on the line for two and he can't believe it here's the long shot at the end of the shot clock and know good active attack there by Dru Smith and looked like he got all ball there with that left hand reach in John Ausar Thompson showing glimpses of why the Pistons took him with a fifth pick in the 2023 draft unique set of Brothers AAR with the Pistons a man with a Rockets two young guys making some early and positive Impressions uh at the start of their NBA careers it's interesting he's as athletic as he is he's to me and in my limited scope of seeing him he he he's much more confident on the defensive side of the floor to me and and just running the floor really looks like he's not totally in control of his offensive game yet and as athletic as he is not sure how to use it with his skill set as of yet but so young as you referenced earlier John you know what's funny you you a lot of teams shy away from drafting a guy that stays in college four years and comes out at 22 or 23 the patience it takes when you draft a 19-year-old I mean probably going to have to wait two or three years before that player matures uh to a way that he can really help you so either way it's you you make your best guess on who you think can help you just under 3 seconds left in the half and and the butler Butler will he get it off he did and almost made it Jimmy Butler with a 21-point first half including 14 in the second quarter with the heat fell behind by 15 the Miami battled back behind Butler's 21 first half points we got ourselves a tight one halfway through here in the Motor City with the Pistons ahead of the heat by four see they gave up 63 points on 58% shooting to the Pistons through the first two quarters Detroit overcame 13 turnovers you know how they went 10 of 15 from three Eric Reed with the point guard John Cy Cade Cunningham they're buding Allstar guard at a Allstar caliber first half yeah it really did really controlled the basketball well got them into offense and and really got them out in transition to used the size when he could had 10 points um four for four from the field so really efficient play love his ability to handle the ball in creen and eight assists and that's where uh Detroit really was able to pull ahead his ability to orchestrate most of these shots whether it was in transition or in their half court game uh the players really reading him and and he played efficiently only two turnovers for him along with those eight assists so that is a a tough guy to guard in Cade gunningham Malik Beasley three to3 from downtown Ausar Thompson his highest scoring game of his abbreviated second season in the NBA at only his seventh game for Jimmy Butler his highest scoring first half of the Season Jimmy had a 21 Point second half earlier this year in a loss to the Sacramento Kings Butler scored 14 of those 21 in the second quarter yeah I love how Jimmy not only scored he had five assists zero turnover so solid floor game along with that offensive production uh sorry toson skywalking again so 13 points for him now previous ey was a nine-point game against Philadelphia he got to slow these guys down on the defensive end the Pistons with a six-point lead as we get rolling here in the third quarter on a mild winter night in Detroit a 40° night as Herro lost the ball Cunningham on a hit ahead Thompson on a throw down a shaky way for the heat to start this second half two straight scores for a Thompson in between a heat turnover yeah just too easy too they're getting right to the basket points in the paint right now and along with those 10 three balls that is not a good sign for Miami they've got to take care and manage the basketball S Thompson picking up his third foul John tell you where where the game is being determined right now I think in the back cour Beasley and Cunningham have combined through 23 points Herro and Robinson just 10 points Tyler held the seven first half points they both were one of four from downtown in the first two quarters they need to get on track iby trailing by eight a minute into the third Duncan coming Baseline heth's pass deflected Herro has it with three to shoot in and out and turn comes down with a rebound for Jalen Duren that's his ninth rebound tonight Timmy Hardaway flipping it back Beasley flipping it up and in an uncanny Shooters Malik Beasley has 16 points he's knocked in all four his trip yeah it's got a super quick release as soon as it touches his hands it's up Jimmy Butler from a corner in and out that's his third three-point attempt tonight he's made one of them here comes Beasley and Highsmith quickly to the rebound Highsmith nobody going to stop him he's going to take take it all the way in but it's a traveling violation on aood yeah got caught in between looked like he was going to pull up and shoot a jumper kind of dragged that pivot foot tried to get inside of cave Cunningham there Miami down by 11 kind of settle down this offense right now here in the third quarter first seven points of the quarter to the Pistons here's Cunningham Highsmith on him great help by Pam but it left Duren free and a scholer wants a timeout nine straight piston points to open up the second half using that height inside is both Cunningham with the Up and Under extra step and then Duren the big Power Man inside and distance off to the better start here in the third quarter calling all hoopers ages 7 to 17 it's Junior Heat Winter Camp it returns for only 350 bucks this 3-day Camp will be held at slam Miami and Cooper City high school on January 2nd through January 4th from a.m. to p.m. scan the QR code to sign up today coach Tony fantino he'll teach your kid basketball skills and life's basic fundamentals it's all good folks the Pistons with the first nine points here in the third quarter that's not good the heat are down by 13 with 9 and 1/2 minutes left in this third quarter it has been difficult for the heat on both ends of the floor tonight Jimmy thinking about three shot clock was winding down and he was fortunate to draw a foul that's that's aggravating for this's head coach JB bicker Duren picks up his fourth foul as the shot clock was about to run out driving kick opportunity and Duren again reaching in with those hands he's getting caught far from the basket and on the ball faking Drive Duren just putting that hand in and he's going to have to sit down that's a that's a loss for Detroit to have to sit that big man down he just gives such provides such a physical presence on both ends of the floor in the paint oh Jimmy Butler going to get two free throws tonight numbers eight and nine in the game by the way our crew chief tonight is Curtis player 17-year veteran NBA official guy who keeps himself up in great shape looks like he could still play the game which he once did at the University of Richmond where he was in the same back court as current Cleveland Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson you went against those guys oh yeah man we used to beat them up in the Richmond Times Dispatch coach dick tarant and those two guys in the back court and our UVA Cavaliers we used to match up with those guys the NBA world and the basketball world as we talk about all the time it's so small it's amazing and love catching up with both Curtis and Kenny Atkinson anytime I can great memories battling those guys Curtis Blair who still lives in the Richmond area Butler with the two free throws cuts the deficit to 11 Jimmy has 23 points he's eight of nine at the strike that's a defensive rebound for Butler and here they come Herro in transition get up Tyler Herro cannot find it from three one for six Holland with a left hand Ron Holland boy when you let the Pistons fly they take advantage they're ahead by 13 74- 61 Highsmith sits up oh he just cold from three six out of 24 as a 10 Cade Cunningham he already has a double double 10 points 12 assists only two turnover Cunningham rejected by pan he just slammed the door on Cade Cunningham Jimmy pumping with Beasley takes him to the paint and he coughed it up here comes Jim harway Beasley just put on the brakes now drives in and from behind Highsmith knocked it free they never gave up on the play Heywood he Smith got beat by a step and recovered a great lesson for young players you might get beat initially you can get yourself back into the play if you hustle four minutes into the third quarter here trying to get himself going that elvs the bucket M the foul on Beasley Tyler Herro this is ninth point of the game gets inside Beasley who's reaching and then the push on the back with the change of pace there by Tyler and able to draw that foul and get the ball up give it a chance and one it has not been easy for Tyler but maybe this can get him going this three-point play it's four for 11 now from the field including one of six Beyond The Arc 10-point Detroit lead he going to need some more scoring for Tyler Herro he's used to up in the volume when the game gets tight and the game gets late crosscourt to Beasley for a three that guy is something else Malik Beasley five of six from downtown tonight he has 19 points he had a 21o game the last time these clubs met was held with three points when he missed 11 of his 12 shots in the late October game in Miami streaky shooting nice pass B could not put it in after the crafty Herro feed Dru Smith finds Butler underneath but he's surrounded six on the shot clock Dru Smith gets in but an offensive foul and John that's the second charge of Tim Hardaway Jr's taking tonight definitely spot let's watch this make sure he's not outside that that restricted area through that right heel close on that line that was close couldn't quite see again on that one but Dru Smith picking up his fourth foul they'll come out for Terry Rozier you know not against the Heat don't get me wrong would would never root against the Heat but you find yourself always rooting for Tim Hardaway J the the son of the Hall of Fame Heat point guard who Jersey hangs the Raptors one of the retired numbers for Miami Cunningham on the post against bam bottle deont here's p and to Paul Reed he'll fire with two on the shot clock first field goal tonight for Reed who has four points off the Pistons pinch air in front by 15 that was a very good defensive possession with multiple efforts there up until that tough read shot Herro from way out Shide and the rebound comes to Thompson Herro slipped in getting back on defense Hardaway Jr driving on Rozier muscles his way in and it's going to be a blocking foul on Rozier who got hit right in the face ohy boy he took that right in the nose Timmy leading with that right shoulder watch this contact right here boom right there hit him right in the face that is just insult to injury when you're a player and you take that kind of shot and then they call a foul on you like you fouled them with your face W Beasley out the leak piece 19 points five of their 12 threes let's pause for a message from Dural Kia Durell Kia is loaded with over 500 new Kia models in stock NOW test drive a new 25 Kia Sportage today Dell Kia drive for L Drive Durell found Teo in the the game replacing Beasley so it's Cunningham fontecchio Hardaway Reed and Thompson for the Pistons a 15-point now a 16-point lead for Detroit this is their biggest lead of the game bam out of p with just over 6 minutes left in the third quarter turns with a hook and hits 11 points tonight for bam need to get bam reactivated going to the basket too that's a good strong move by him getting into the paint with the right hand hook Miami finds herself down by 14 Cunningham nice pitch for a Thompson dun and J Cade Cunningham is carving up the heat with his playmaking has 14 assists Now Ausar Thompson with 17 points a Miss by go here but a whistle and Terry will go to the strike but they heater down by 16 Cade Cunningham the vision again on display here going right and look with the fire to the left to find that athletic Thompson who has been finishing on top of the rim with regularity he's got 17 points on 7 to n shooting for the Pistons Tim Hardaway just picked up his fourth foul tro to a stripe with the heat down big number challenge unsuccessful as explained to this by Curtis BL Rozier will get his two free throws after him but Miami down John 82 to 66 they been out scored 19-7 in this quarter he missing seven of their first nine shots on the quarter the Piston's defense which has struggled recently has played really well T night yeah I agree I thought Mi came out very flat didn't bring the same energy to start the game that they did in the third and the Pistons on the other side came out much more locked in defensively they were the more aggressive team and it's really yielded results here in the third quarter with them taking this lead this a Pistons team that lost last Thursday at ption by 24 123 to 99 they dropped four their last five games Miami came cruising in with a four game winning streak beating the Lakers Suns Cavaliers and Raptors all in a row all at home e got some Road issues they got to solve now they've lost three of their last four on thead Road those free throws by Rozier and he did get both were his first two points of the game I mean needs everything to click they're down by 14 with five and a half left here in the third quarter Cade Cunningham 10 points 14 assists and Butler has the rebound for the heat 23 points eight boards five assists for jimy he needs some help berer on a high post against vonia leans in and it rolls off right to Rosia HZ for three IE hwz getting good shots but he's struggling he's three for his last 25 from downtown that's over a 14 game stretch a really rough lock at his three-point shooter he stayed behind by 14 they've missed 20 of their 26 triples Cunningham knocks one in a triple for Cade Cunningham very well balanced had Miami's best defender on in bam Adebayo and able to get to that left hand and create enough space on the pull back to at least that triple now Miami's down by 17 the biggest lead of the game for the Pistons shot clock down the seven for the heat he's getting Gregor into give it to Jimmy and watch him right now as opposed to get to that ball movement it's just hard to rely on him to have to score in every possession and got to get back to running hard cutting hard and and really moving that ball deed offense been stagnant the defense just not quite up to par tonight for Miami Sasser on the Move missed tip by Paul Reed and here comes Tyler here that's one for seven with his three-point shooting tonight gets tangled up with Sasser and taken down for the turnover and Jimmy Butler that's terrific Hustle by the heat veteran to get back and circumvent and he pushed in Fast Break Tyler looked like he got grabbed on that right arm there this has been a scrappy defensive effort particularly in the second half by the pistons pistons has 13 turnovers in the first half they haven't committed one here in the third quarter Detroit shooting 57% and here's the real B 13 out of 19 from three-point line this a team that came in ranks 16th in the league in three-point percentage and it comes that's Beasley for The Cutting Reed who scores easily six points for Paul Reed and the Pistons leaded by 19 now 87 to 68 Terry Ros here maneuver a step back through K BR here first field goal of the game for Terry his 41st triple this season well he'd have some coming back to do trailing by 16 just over 3 minutes to go third quarter Beasley with Herro reaching in oh was in the cookie jar and pulled it away and Sasser triple Marcus Sasser getting more minutes tonight in the absence of Jaden NY and that's his second triple of the game and a score there for Butler and a foul quick Advanced pass down the floor and Butler is just beining right to the rim like a fullback knocking the defender right out of the way had the angle on bees he takes him with the shoulder here's the pitch ahead and here's the deliverable right there that knock Paul Reed excuse me right out of the way n one opportunity on the continuation I love it when you use football you look it rubs off will apply by the way yeah J is hits that Gap and he makes it happen got in the town to watch the end of the Detroit Lions Buffalo Bills game last night what a g both teams scored in the 40s the bills Prevail Heat trailing by 16 that's a Beasley three and again he strikes gold six of seven from downtown Malik Beasley with 22 points he's tripled three times in in this quarter and the heat again trailing by 19 yeah this is a team that averages 13 M threes for an entire game they've got 15 already uh so you know they are getting a a tremendous performance and Malik Beasley is the reason why six of seven now from Beyond The Arc he's got 22 points to lead the Pistons Sasser picks up the foul Malik Beasley one of the best three-point shooters in the NBA came into the game with 92 he's got six more so that gives him 98 he is one ahead of Tyler Herro in third place among all NBA three-point shootings by way Tyler did extend his three-point streak tonight with his one Splash 58 straight games for him he's chasing the record that his teammate Duncan Robinson holds of 69 consecutive games dun did that between February of 2021 and November of 2021 roquez makes both free throws nine points for highman Heat trailing by 17 it's that man again this time he brick it off the glass and here comes Jimmy off his eighth rebound actually his ninth and he SC we get a score on Duncan's three Duncan Robinson he needed that Splash his second three of the game and the heat are within 14 six assist for Jimmy Butler on the pitch ahead Duncan getting that corner and need him to continue to be active out there looking for that triple threes can bring you back so can your defense butle with a steel here they come the gang in red Kevin Love Oh rejected from behind by Young Ron Holland the 19-year-old rookie at a Duncanville Texas FIA and Kevin lovees looking deep for Jimmy a long lead he gets him and ran out of space 10 heat turn boy a pitch ahead there and Jimmy Butler trying to hang on and Tippy Towing and just gets that heel on the line and that delay of game there they call it's the second one on Miami so it'll be a technical against the Heat and free throw here for the Detroit Pistons and for Malik Beasley who is having a feast tonight at the Heats expense his second big game against Miami this year in the Pistons overtime win he had 21 points went five of 11 from three tonight 23 points and he's gone six of eight from downtown we told you

adab bio Robinson Dru Smith and Terry Rozier start the quarter for the heat HZ flipping it up and in I may HZ finding consistent success going to the basket tonight he has 13 points when they play him

they Heat have their hands full here with the Pistons as Robinson hits hits a important three for the heat he's got nine points I say important because the heat need every point they can get trailing by 13 with just over 9 minutes left yeah coming off the Baseline there Duncan getting that down screen allowed him to get that open three Duren puts it in and draws a foul Jalen Duren counter punching Miami underneath yeah they're going right inside to that big man here's the hesitation and the Twan game bam having to leave Duren the guard keade Cunningham as he went off that high pick and roll and that allowed Duren to catch and finish inside big man's got eight points and 10 boards first foul on Pam Jalen Duren will go to the strike as Sasser replaces Fontecchio give the Pistons credit there without two starters tonight Tobias Harris and Jaden Ivy both out with injuries they lost a third contributor in Isaiah Stewart and Jet hasn't mattered to them they have led comfortably for most of this second half right now it's a a 16-point Detroit lead with 9 minutes to play Dru Smith here's Rozier off the Adebayo screen and Duren grabs another rebound for Detroit that's his 11th rebound they have pounded the heat on the glass tonight 41- 27 John they've out oh another three for Cunningham a very familiar scrip the Pistons are following Cade Cunningham is leading them and John they are controlling the glass for the third straight time this year against the Heat I mean they came in the first two outings they out rebounded Miami by a total of 23 and tonight they've had rebound to the heat by 15 it's beas and the rebound to Rosie just 805 to play as Rozier flips it up and draws the foul cherry got pushed and he went flying into the basket support now Roser will get a couple of free throws Marcus Sasser picking up his second foul let's pause for a message while we can from FB there's something about the people of Florida that makes us go the extra mile fbl working for you every single day oh car Rose here hitting the first end of the two shot situation the 30-year-old Rose here you know joh it's interesting in his nine games off the bench he's averaging 11 minutes per game in the fourth quarter so he he's not starting but he is finishing more games than not so he's rebounded the ball well his offense a little quiet the last few games was here for the season at just under 12 points a game tonight he has n Robinson on the bench with nine HZ on the bench with 13 Tyler here just checking back in the heat down by 17 with just under 8 minutes left Jimmy Butler also back in the game ER spuler not giving in his team not giving in they're digging in plenty of time left time is not the issue yet they've allowed Detroit to basically navigate offensive without much disturbance they're shooting 58% from the field and they're 59% from three 16 out of 27 that's harder R and that's Terry Rose here he he has been rebounding the ball effectively for Miami good defense by Tyler Herro on Tim Jr too contesting that shot need more of that closed out closing out this game there's just very little room for error with this deficit Dru Smith dials the right number again finds bam for the Baseline slam there you go 13 points for bam a timeout for the Pistons Miami trying to it's his 10th game this year with over 20 points got 25 he's made six of his nine threes readen cry court side view of this 10792 Pistons lead we a 710 left in the game A sry Thompson got there but missed on the flip comes away with his seventh rebound Tyler her it has been an unusually quiet evening for him four 13 shooting one out of eight from three only 10 points that's 14 under what he averages gunningham it poked from behind out of bounds but Beasley with 25 but John it's hard not to be impressed with with Cade Cunningham plays a mature game 16 points 15 assists this young man only 23 years old yeah I give him credit because he's really trying to get his teammates involved he's trying to make the winning play right now instead of just trying to score and he has uh as a result been able to get them some really quality shots Jimmy Butler with his 10th rebound giving him his second double double of the Season hereo little pull up from mid-range and a splash any any schooler is welcome on night like Heroes having just 12 points well he's been really been contested and defended outside the arc so he had to get inside with the quick catch and go pull up with that right hand uh dribble and they need threes right now can't be exchanging baskets right now with Detroit he need better defense they have been too giving tonight A S Thompson his best game of the year by far with 19 points Thompson also with seven rebounds here Euro stepping to the paint that's four points in a row for Tyler good aggressive attacks by Tyler on backto back possessions we're under six minutes left in the game that's Beasley again and again he is locked in he I mean just coming off that down screen there he's got that Ultra quick relief he's got season High 28 points as Butler TI it home 28 points for Jimmy Butler Butler flirting with his first triple double of the year but so far it's Malik Beasley's night 28 points and seven triples for Beasley heater down by 14 just over 5 minutes left Cunningham missing on the three and Rozier hustles to the rebound there's still enough time yeah it's going to be a foul on the Pistons and assort Thompson having a conversation with Curtis player Thompson going to pick up the foul that's his fourth personal with the push and I think he's been he's been an excellent perimeter Defender today uh really made it difficult for Tyler Herro in particular to create space to to operate on the offensive end quickly in the Rozier maneuvering pass Beasley and I think he stepped toad of bounds oh calling for a hook off in Terry roir right here watch the left to right there hooking the leg around Beasley good call by in Wang illegal maneuver by Rozier with 5 minutes to go in this fourth quarter this is Paul Reed former to Paul blue Cunningham another nice pass that's Thompson who misses on the three Reed with the offensive rebound and a defensive foul against Miami going to pick up that foul yeah he's fouling out right now he's been active getting his money's worth in their active hands 440 left here in the fourth quarter of 14 Point deficit for Miami cunning against Herro hero poked it free Here Comes Dru Smith oh he ran out of room but a blocking foul on Tim Hardaway Jr's already drawn two charges here in the game he wanted number three Dre Smith able to skip a little bit to the right here to his right and Tim Hardaway Jun leaning to the left and that's why he's picking up that Char Two Shots here for Dru Smith fifth foul on Tim Hardaway Jr all grown up the age of 32 so Dru Smith to the strike scored all five of his points tonight back in the first quarter but again John we're seeing Smith and Rozier I think they played the entire fourth quarter again in this game Dru Smith four straight games with all 12 minutes of the fourth quarter coming in Rozier we told you already 11 minutes per game in the fourth quarter in his nine games off the pench this year as Smith makes them both it's a 12-point Pistons lead with 420 left not undoable cuningham back the other way runs in a a Stonewall defender in bam we get a double team and it's going to be looks like Heat ball no no no it's a timeout JB picker called the timeout and he's arguing that there were foul but they had him trapped right up against the sideline there Cade Cunningham making a poor decision a dribble to basketball over to the wing area and what a clamp job here and bailed out by his coach who call timeout see that QR code scan it and you can register right now for a day filled with Fitness fun and giving back with heathe head coach Eric spola coach SPO trying to help his team find a way they're down by a dozen with 409 remaining here in the fourth quarter on a night where the Pistons have had it their way 55% shooting and 17 triples on 55% three-point shooting for Detroit cross cour to Thompson against the Heat Zone it's Hardaway and the rebound comes down to Herro by the way the 17 threes for the Pistons ties their fifth most in a game this year here's Herro heo that a a force shot against some very good Ausar Thompson Defense John you got to give Thompson a lot of credit for the difficult night hereo no he's he's played excellent defense and that athleticism is is the reason why he's able to stay like glue close to Tyler who's really good at creating separation from most Defenders oh pretty lean in move by Cunningham but he missed the way of Jimmy butley having one of his better statistical games 28 points 12 rebounds seven assists and going back to the strike for Two Shots Jimmy Butler rebounds are a season High AAR Thompson picking up his fifth foul me just bully balled him took him down low and leaned on him I cannot make out that champ now Butler at the strike with 318 left on the clock now Jimmy butley 28 points 12 boards seven assists nine of 11 free throw shooting Butler also four steals in the game now butley with 29 but Miami down by 11 with 314 remaining and the clock moving got to be perfect down the stretch for the heat perfect hard way Jun now Fontecchio and that helps turnover gives the ball back to Miami the 19th Detroit turnover of this game it's amazing they're in the lead with that many turnovers Miami scored 22 points off those 19 turnovers not only in the lead a double digit lead with 19 turnovers oh the Rainbow by Tyler Herro could the Boy Wonder do it g he's got 17.7 here in the fourth quarter it's an eight-point game he is a ignitable 240 to play Cunningham probing for the 15-footer he missed it Butler with his 13th rebound a score here could really make it interesting and they get it on a butler eighth assist to The Cutting Rozier oh the heat down by six it's 112 to 106 this is just great ball movement finding Tyler for the Triple and all of a sudden on the next play Terry Rozier able to get to the rim and beat right back in this here with 224 to go a 21 to screen to get Tyler the open triple and then look at the dive cut in Terry rier from Jimmy Butler cutting this lead to six and there's some restlessness here in this building and momentum shifted you can see the concern on the Pistons coach coaches faces they're calling that timeout John it's 25 to 15 Miami here in the fourth quarter they will press full court oh Pistons break it easily down to 218 the play Beasley operating against Rozier Dru Smith on Cunningham with six on the shot clock three on the shot clocCade Cunningham dble Beasley unloads it's an air ball and a shot clock violation John I I think the Pistons are feeling the pressure of the game tightening and a heat defense toughening well a much better job also by the heat right there confusing the Pistons as they tried to double play off the double team Cade Cunningham waited too long to pass out of that double team under two minutes left in the game key possession a Herro three got it Tyler Herro a 10-point fourth quarter a 20-point game and the heat trail by only three it's a 21 to5 Miami run is he clutch or what wow what a delivery by her here's Cunningham with a shot clock down the six Thompson with a foot on the three-point line he missed it and at a bile with the rebound but he could tie it with a three a minute 18 left he picked up his dribble go to work Jimmy Jimmy againsts Hardaway barreling in and scoring Jimmy Butler now with 31 points it's a one-point game a 23-5 run for Miami it's 112 to 111 here's Cunningham talked by Dru Smith look at that defense bumer doubled they knocked the ball free and take it away with 54 seconds left in the game back in the hands of Jimmy gets by Thompson here fakes it now fires Oh short Butler gets the rebound 40 seconds left him again gets by Duren to the basket for the flip he missed it and no foul Eric spuler can't believe it he thought Butler Dru the foul now you need a defense and a rebound 25 seconds left Pistons with a one-point lead in the ball five on the shot clock for Cunningham three to shoot Cunningham off the spin runs into Smith and it's a tripping foul on Dru Smith Oh but he thought they had the stop Dru Smith fouls out on that play Crazy Action here on the crossover active I thought Tyler had it and Dru Smith trying to come over and help here on the spin move dangerous spin move going into the middle of the floor and a blocking foul called be two shots here for Cade Cunningham Dru Smith SS out on that play Smith 31 minutes seven points and a couple of assists to put Cunningham at the strip John for two shots he's one for three at the line tonight and is is a 79% free throw shooter the Pistons up by one but even if he makes both the heat he'll be only down by three Kevin Love checks in for the heat fontecchio replaces Hardaway for the Pistons he of two timeouts the Pistons have zero timeouts left here so coach olra will most likely opt to call a timeout to have the maximum amount of of seconds to be able to advance the ball to the front Court Cunningham makes both timeout Miami they'll get the ball down by three with 11 and 1/2 seconds left and that's what this game will come down to wow that's just an amazing comeback again Tyler Herro and Jimmy Butler tag team in this comeback well well John now now the Pistons have a decision to make do you just defend or do you take a foul and give up two free throws I mean to me the the foul to me would make sense you solid and then if you see someone getting anywhere near taking the shot you foul uh but right now I I think you got to put the ball in Tyler Hero's hands look for the triple if you can uh you just don't have a ton of time left you do have an extra timeout but you still have one timeout left so there is if you could get a quick two you may gamble on that and then look to pick up full court and again go for a steal because you got that extra timeout remember Tyler Herro had 10 points through three quarters he has scored 10 points here in the fourth quarter including two of his three triples the heat need a triple to tie the game on a night where they're shooting 29% from down down and just being aggressive looking for the three here could force Detroit into a foul and and a three you know a three shot foul Pistons don't have any timeouts left the Heat have one left now the heat will have Herro Rozier Robinson Adebayo and Butler Herro will inbound watch Tyler coming right back to the ball when he passes it to Jimmy Butler to come back to get it down by three trying to send the game to overtime in the gym looking back for Tyler can't get it there now he does he'll fire and hit he hit it to tie the game at 114 with 5.1 seconds left no timeouts for the Pistons Cunningham from half court missed it for the second straight visit to Detroit the Heat and pistons will go to overtime Tyler Herro delivering 10 points through three quarters he scores 13 points in the fourth quarter including the three to give us an extra 5 minutes unbelievable knew they were going to come back to him Jimmy finding him on the dribble handoff and Tyler comes through again they tried to run a double screen for him going away from the ball he cuts back and gets the ball from Jimmy may have gotten fouled on this shot too on the landing that is just amazing concentration and confidence holy moly Tyler Herro 23 points now on 4 of 13 Beyond The Arc the heat Clos the fourth quarter John on an 18-2 run so Miami gets 23 points from here a 31.5 rebound nine assist game so far for Jimmy Butler five extra minutes waiting for us here in Detroit on FanDuel Sports Network Tyler Herro tonight with four triples 23 points three of those triples came in the fourth quarter the heat battle back from 16 down in the fourth quarter they went down by 19 twice late in the third quarter no quit for the Heat and and there's Tyler's dad sitting in court side and no longer any use for the seat they standing here in Detroit he was hopping up and down watching his son convert a couple of those triples there in the fourth he wasn't the only one sh a GRE jum they're going to play five extra minutes looks like the

Pistons the heat will get it back with 404 left in overtime yeah this young Preston's team just looks really dejected right now with some of these decisions they're making ball goes right off of Thompson out of bounds moment could be too big right there for them 21 pist and turnovers have ignited the let's go Heat chance here in Detroit Rozier pulled back 20 foot bounces off to Jalen Duren 15

made a field goal since the 505 Mark of the fourth quarter Beasley with a brick and Herro with a rebound they he in firm control right now they have outscored the Pistons here in overtime 6 nothing they end the fourth quarter on an 18-2 R do the math it's the heat pouring it on at the right time Rozier for Duncan oh six to shoot Duncan on the run for two give him the runner Duncan Robinson getting run off the three no problem 80 Miami in the overtime until that hard to away three 10 points for junior Miami in front 122 to 117 just under two minutes left in in overtime look out Butler

Hardaway another triple for him backto back three balls for Tim Hardaway Jr is senior looks on it's a two-point Heat lead still an adventure with a minute 35 left in overtime Cade Cunningham finding the hot shooter after making a one on the previous possession Tim hard way Jr stepping up for his fourth triple fourth quarter deficit at about the 942 Mark Tyler Herro with a 134th quarter 23-point game Jimmy Butler with one of the best games he's ever played in the heat uniform 33 points 17 rebounds nine assists four Steals and not a single turnover in his 43 Immaculate minutes but John the heat need a score here they're only up by two with a minute 32 left in overtime another crucial possession in this long battle her against Holland to the basket and out to B with 10 on the shot CL Duncan back to b seven a shoot Herro forces it up an airball not a good possession Hardaway Jun Oh my he gives a Pistons a one-point lead he's tripled three times in a row here in overtime what an incredible game a minute 10 left now in overtime the heat need a score well the airball forceed by Tyler Herro at one end and then Hardaway feeling it leaning off balance but true Tim Hardaway Jr five triples 16 points nine of those points in a row here in the fourth quarter on three straight triples now the heat need a score to take the lead back with a minute to play in overtime should be lost his shoot one shoot for for for Butler and one point behind his Miami oh no bam to the basket with three on the shot clock got to put it up Butler with a one rebound and score one shoe on two points in and the Heat lead by one with 40 seconds left Cunningham puts the Pistons ahead by one 125 124 36 seconds left well this amazing game Roars on a triple double by the way for Cade Cunningham 20 points 18 assists and 11 boards Herro an open three he missed it and the rebound of during with 20 seconds left they to foul got a foul how do they not call that a foul clock stops with 15.9 seconds left well you got to give the Pistons a lot of credit they they look dead in the water when the heat scored the first six points of the over time but they have battled back he'd have to press up here this is not a a bonus scenario here so he are going to have to press up go for the steel you don't get the basketball you got to foul right away if you're Miami Duncan Robinson picking up that foul miam he needs a takeaway here a one-point Pistons lead switch some of these screen actions and he got a call timeout they use their last time out there good defense by Miami on the face C crazy crazy game wild and competitive Advent Adventure come on back for the Finish 55 points his tight his career high with 18 rebounds nine assists four steals no turnovers and a moment ago with one shoe on and one shoe off a putb score that momentarily gave Miami the lead Cunningham with a quick score back the other way and that'll be Pistons ball with just under 16 seconds left they have a one-point lead so what's the defensive strategy again for Miami got you know press sure as much as possible go for the steel here if you don't get the steel you got to foul right away J Will inbound in the front cour love to see more of a contest on the ball to take away an Easy Pass oh to the backer threw it away Herro with the steal 14 seconds left in the game unbelievable Eric spuler wants a timeout with 9.4 seconds left the Pistons turning the ball over in explicably for the 22nd time that was a terrible inbounds PASS gives Miami a silver platter opportunity to win the game on the last possession of over this is just mental breakdown here trying to lead the P instead of giving it right to uh the the initial catch there I think it was Beasley Tim Hardaway Jr actually threw it into the back court I don't know what he was thinking 22 points actually 28 points off 22 Detroit turnovers that was GI wrap for Herro thought about an immediate three Eric spoler takes the timeout and John he don't need a three you don't need a three even free throws would help they're down by one where do you see this go yeah huge amount of time left so going Advance the ball to the front Court have 9.4 seconds look to get the ball into to Tyler or Jimmy again running a play trying to get them something going to the basket again I I don't think you need to shoot any kind of crazy step back three here getting to the rim on a hard drive or even a pullup Runner or a pull-up jump shot okay here two points wins it John I know Herro has been the guy late in games but my gut tells me that's the man that should have the ball his ability to to get free throws could come in really handy at this point I will tell you this the referees you're going to have to it's going to have to be a really clear hard foul for them to make a call here you got to go to the basket and and try to score and not anticipate a foul call here all right Duncan will inbound as he tried and execute a late game maneuver the lob in for butman makes the catch goes up miss it gets it back and a foul with 6.4 seconds left I knew he could do it Butler will go to the line with two shots and the heat down by one point and 6.4 seconds left in overtime credit Duncan too that was not an easy pass over the top oh they're calling it on the ground so it's not a two shot foul oh my so no free throws for buman 6.4 seconds left the heat side inbounds from the offensive end got to do it again her a flash free gets it got a hurry Tyler three seconds left a long three for the win and the game ends the Pistons for the second time this year beat the heat in overtime 125 124 despite the 17th triple double in Jimmy Butler's career Tyler well the heat needed two Tyler Herro went for three with time running out and that's how close the heat came to an overtime walk-off win first time since the 2018 2019 season that the Heat lose two games in a season to the Pistons both in overtime this year
