 Drive penetrate that zone screen that zone sometimes you got to figure out who to screen to get someone open it'll be a battle for Pace because Miami wants to play a lot slower with Terry Rozier Tyler Herro Haywood Highsmith Jaime Jaquez and Bam Adebayo for the heat they open for an Adebayo post up Jaquez who had a triple double last night back to B with shot clock at three Fade Away jumper is through so for the Warriors Steph Curry Dennis Schroder with Andrew Wiggins Draymond Green and Trayce Jackson-Davis Warriors had a day off but had lost by 30 to Sacramento got Highsmith on steper on that pick and roll and tjd finishing around a good Defender Adebayo ran Forte mus dagger will blow the whistles tonight with Steph on that weak side his Defender hugged up on him so you don't have to worry about the weak side that pocket pass will be open here throwing it back back they another mid-range well defended by Wiggins we highlighted him in the open Draymond Warriors throw that one away Draymond just wasn't looking he was I mean the heat were up like 17 with 8 minutes left Jaquez a quick speed move but Draymond recovered in time yeah spoler and Steve have been on Olympic coaching staffs together they're very close both a lot of respect longtime coaches for both their teams Wiggins attacking quick his second jump and that's the good thing you can drive even if you don't finish everyone's near the rim and go to the glass be relentless tonight that's the thing the heat the last three games teams are shot around 70% from the restricted area against Wiggins blocking Rozier Trayce’s the middleman and step open Wing three off iron you're trying to find every opportunity you can in transition run on this team see if they want to get back Jaquez Trey's got a piece of it or your defense early is excellent against Sacramento the Warriors lived out at the three-point line and had a bunch of turnovers and got down big in that first quarter Wiggins is not doing that now but threw that one away he's gone inside multiple times tyler Herro taken away by Curry St with good defense that's how you sprint back and move your feet catch and shoot and Steph with an air ball three well he knows he's not going to have a player yeah Tyler Herro career best in everything this year he's emerging as a superstar without Jimmy Butler he knows he has to stay aggressive and that man too Adebayo so bam averaging 16 a game his numbers scoring wise are down a little bit from a year ago but without Jimmy Butler Adebayo’s had to shoulder a lot of the load and he shot more threes and then on the road is Warriors miss another three on the road for Adebayo his percentage is aren't is good so he's trying to get those back up see Herro Dynamic there but having that knocked away Steph is moving his feet even if it looks like he's beat he's not going to give up on the you're going to see Alec Burks and Kevin Love and some veterans that didn't play last night but right now the heat starters are hanging right with the dubs as Adebayo misses the jumper Sher inside that's the right idea though you want to test Tyler Herro see if he wants to move his feet sher's slow getting up it's a five on four Rozier missing that three now the heat had been top seven in three-point shooting but it really cooled off the last two games bot him down to 10th in the league but they can make three Steph wanted contact there didn't get it and so it's a rock fight right now Warriors two of Nine the heat two of nine defensive battle Herro with the show and go getting to that bid range and riming that home there Draymond just slipped there caught an edge and could have been layup he's okay though tjd with a great move and worries about a couple they've left on the iron here that has been a season long yeah it's gone on this whole home stand and we got a foul early that's Rozier and Adebayo little two-man game TR challenged that shot and Wiggins solid defense defensive rebound Trayce running the floor knocked out of bounds still Warrior ball you see Terry Rozier watch have to bring up snow why and speaking of shooting we just kind of spoke that into existence basically I told you he's going to be moving up that list at Detroit Indiana Toronto and Minnesota nice week for the Warriors be a lot of snow nice block Trayce Jackson-Davis yo Herro set a great screen on him it looked like he was behind but just kept working that was phenomenal and Trayce came on an open three a little flat there Draymond's missed his first two threes if you like defense this is your game the heat are always going to play a solid defensive game Jaquez got on the other side of Draymond he fou him ulated it Draymond tried to WP but Podziemski got hit in the face like 30 times this year already that doesn't help buddy Hield tied up by Jaquez for the jump ball see where buddy Hield is looking you could well he's facing that way so you could just go there but Kel'el Wear the one-year player out of Indiana he was the 15th pick in the draft I like him he's pretty agile very bouncy he's he's got stupid bounc b it out of bounds orri will take that he won the jump but gave us the ball back that respect the vertical spacing he's a pretty good rim protector he run runs the floor extremely well he's got a great NBA body well this pace is exactly what Miami would want it's taking the crowd out of it Steph trying to get the crowd back into it so Steph's it back to back jumper as you see where where was he was guarding the screener just didn't drop coverage Steph knows if he can come off that screen andot his man he's going to have some space you were going to say where was where where was where on that play II Jaquez steps in for three Warriors got to come back for those rebounds he did better job there Draymond fouled yeah that's Steph just crossing pass with setting up step again and he bottoms a three the same pain be found I'm no I'm done sorry oh where oh where that a right Steph missed his first three he's made his last three Tyler Herro from deep and good box out by Draymond Green Oh Andrew Wiggins and the push ahead and the Wiggins basket hanging able to Ram that home and the heat will take time now you get culture they do things differently here they say heat culture is not for everybody and you got Tyler Herro and Adebayo that have thrived in heat culture Nia Jovic who was really good in the Olympics misses that three he's one constant in away from being the best player in the world change that change that V to a catch Draymond couldn't finish that and then where knocked that away from Kyle Anderson good block you either got to go up stronger or pump fake some one Tyler Herro unlimited range and he bottoms that three the speed Cuts that's why I say he moves at a different pace if you're not ready to defend him he can make you look crazy 69 straight with a made three slowmo pump fake pump fake and then where is changing shot shot pretty nice for a rookie Smith tracking that down Jaquez ran the floor the Warriors have Jaquez yearlong slump but it's not easy to deal with these guys after a great first year everybody's looking at them going okay these guys are a real deal let's come out and show them what this league is about Moses Moody's first playing time but he Hield an open three offline there and buddy I don't know if it's going to take itting on the road or something but his shooting over the last eight games has just been so unlike him driving again and lays it in he's looking to fall out this game it's just a a long close out because of that great ball movement and warriors weren't able to get in defensive position after he blew by the defender closing out to here's that zone two3 we talked about on Warrior pregame live and that's how you Dice up a Zone get a layup and a foul that sa hey you say it a lot of times jump into a shop Locker Draymond did that perfectly he didn't avoid it like you play into we's hands if you're jumping away from that Draymond completes the three-point play plus it's more fun you get to jump into him and then Flex like Draymond D like way more fun everybody flexing home Jaquez draw another foul so people come at him a little harder but Jaquez I think he's kind of built different and he's got aners this game and he's that changed direct nice so slow listen Jaquez missed those two free throw mentally tough 72% from the line Jaquez off to a nice beginning here he's got nine step has eight so they're extending the zone now little full court press back into a Zone they've been in the zone for a few possessions now don't see a lot of true 131 and two three Zone but that that's what they play and Booty's there in the middle love that shot Moses got the rebound there there's no reason to throw that shot back up once you get the fresh 14 you can cycle around make the Heat play more defense and the heat give it away that Anderson free steal well that was going to go out of bounds but the official touched it so in a one-point game for Miami this is exactly what they want oh St on fire there good effort buddy Hield to keep it alive but he driving now Anderson wanted to switch sides but then threw it away remember the Philadelphia and the Memphis game where the Warriors made a bunch of shots and scored a lot of points I every game has every game has its own personality the Heat doing work there it's going to be a rock fight against the he% from the field you're holding the heat to 40% shooting that's fine but where has the warrior offense gone listen last six weeks Warriors want to get up and down this has been the heat pace so far right they've been slowing down they drop back into their Zone set their defense up no fast break two fast break points for the Warriors as buddy he finally knocks down to three that's what you need to bust up the Zone yeah buddy had been eight for 39 and it feels good to see that three go down and there will pick up a foul this is another and one OPP I compared him to Danilo galinari but a little more athletic Maybe he can shoot the ball about the 2024 Olympics Ser loss to the USA basketball team and the semifinals I mean that that's an experience you hold on to for a lifetime you got to learn a ton from that Duncan Robinson has checked in you better find him because he's a great three-point shooter want Trayce Jackson-Davis in the middle of this Zone here steel shoter got it back shot clock down to five Bud he's got to make something out of nothing finish that's a great play for Buddy Hield it just saved the day broken play against his Zone driving in there so little handle k landerson beautiful steel two on one buddy on Robinson and he will get to the line you see how he jumped into Robinson though go we see Gary Payton II steal the ball from the best players in the world his buddy misses the free throw but Kyle Anderson amazing on defense and I think he throws catches a lot of offensive players off guard so buddy was six points off the B missed that first free throw made the second Duncan Robinson that's what he does shoots threes just T got there but just a little late they took advantage of his drop coverage there stopped in no man's land after you're trying to switch out onto him you just Tad it late the heat two of six on threes the Warriors Three of nine going with a different kind of zone now buddy side step three off the on iron here's Jovic all that skill but Kyle Anderson what a block Schroder slowed him down and then Anderson cleaned it up Schroder open three that's a wedgie well he had numbers there and that's for not fouling realizing hey I'm getting help from a big guy here don't reach or slap down or commit a foul yeah stay on his hip don't give up the blow by so Trayce winning that tap the wedi takes you back to Center Court for retap just like the beginning of the game that's because no team has possession when it gets wedged in the rim in the back court so this is like a 131 they're usually in a two three Zone yeah they they played both last night against sack shot clock at five shot clock at one hand grenade to Schroder yeah that's they Warriors season and then a team just Springs it on you like this yeah they the Jimmy Butler story is that it dominated in their last week and a half and they've lost three in a row and got blown out at home by Utah the Warriors are just giving them life dun Robinson hits the three so how good their defense before that you're seeing a ton of this Zone mes booty catch and shoot miss that three and just kind of thrown it around the perimeter shooting a three the Utah Jazz went to Miami and beat them by 30 every game is different I mean everybody's beat by 30 this year yeah car OIC laying it in that's the fourth and one in the first 12 and 1 half minutes of this game very well but this is what happens man you get a team that's desperate they come in here and the fact that they're switching up messes with you cuz you want to screen The Zone it may be one guy in the two three and then in the 131 it's a totally different guy kind of takes you out of rhythm Draymond in the middle shot clock at seven Moody getting it back back and open three the Warriors Three of 14 at some point you do have to hit some shots against the Zone well that's part of the reason I think the heat are going with the Zone even more than with the Kings last night they don't trust that the Warriors can take it out of them good play by Wiggins take him out of it with their shooting Draymond little Runner and right now it is contagious with the dubs they're nine of 31 and other than Steph's three of seven nobody's got it going offensively Lindy Waters beautiful steal and he bounced the ball on the Baseline they're going to talk about something here well they want to see if it's a new 24 because Lindy did have possession so yes Alec Burks who was a veteran scorer Off the Bench former Warrior former Nick former piston former jazz hang in the air and the Miss there by Rozier and warriors will take that out of bounds Lindy Waters came back to help you need to surround him as he's got some size in there the Heat have sucked the life out of this building there is no energy here whatsoever St he can singlehandedly reinl the building they screen The Zone screen on the ball and then Draymond Green set a screen for Steph Curry and make sure Duncan Robinson couldn't get to him hey Duncan Robinson put it on the deck very smart Jovic deep three where with the rebound put back up and out Draymond with the rebound in motion can you move it up even on a scattered break before the heat get into that set he early off step that's just in and Steph wants to CR talk about I mean the holidays are over talking about getting a lump of coal in stocking right there and Alec Burks right off the bench and hits a that doesn't feel good I'm blaming the 25% for Burks' three right there Burks' 46% on threes Off the Bench back in the zone he did not play last night by the way Steph Curry and the heater just lucky step's that wide open knocked out of bound stby Warrior ball yeah we'll take that look every night of the that can help if you screen that one guy yeah bam Adebayo back in but now they spoler is going to stay in this until the Warriors start hitting shots they're five of 17 on threes and Moody was pushed from behind that saved C what the heat want you face a team that doesn't shoot the ball well and you can throw your Zone at him and stay in it Atlanta's not wrong the middle Warriors are getting down into bottom six or seven shooting in the league that's wh St on the team like mathematically that doesn't make any sense Lindy Waters lost that out of bounds the Warriors turn it over and you're capable of shooting better the guys against Philadelphia the guys shot 60% there's been guys on the team that just haven't shot as consistently well as they're capable of on the nice roll and L it up and in the shooter Duncan Robinson two Defenders stay with him coach Kerr hates this action right now mean Steve's calling timeouts to try to here you go one and done calip Perry actually went to his high school to watch him work out and the legend is he hit like around 100 threes in a row 25 spots unbelievable step five of 10 the rest of the Warriors are six of 25 shoot another three against that zone Jovic missed the layup step bothered him there get step more shots Waters missing there and Draymond and Trayce fighting for that rebound wiggin a good look now it's just it's getting to be just mental you got guys with wide open shots that are good players they can't throw in the a right now the plan defense Trayce knocked it away be Miami ball out of bounds tell myin Robinson you know where he will be and you know what he will do that is his third three May finding their Rhythm it's their biggest lead right now oh and Steph threw one away one-handed passes the vein of everyone's existence and now the heat continue to add to the lead and Steve will use another can you get get anything inside going to the rim Warriors got to find their belief find their confidence Steve Kerr might use all of his timeouts in the first half and CH Jackson-Davis finishing nicely well that's going to the basket he had that one Defender at The Rim kind of hemmed up there that was well done Alec Burks with Terry Rozier out of by Jovic and dck Robinson B the decision maker Burks out of the corner and Trayce that's a strong rebound Schroder will walk into a three buddy Hield nice offensive rebound and he has a goal tended good eff for buddy Hield on the glass like I said they run Robinson off Trayce with a beautiful deflection through to rewards the big man and that's basketball play D burn it back share the ball go to the rim Warriors love the fast break points they haven't gotten many of those but the Warriors have picked up their energy since that last time out it's a different team right now Al like Burks behind Adebayo Lindy recovered far over the screen du to Robinson he wanted to put it on the deck Rozier Schroder played the D he had Adebayo fight for that rebounder put it back up and in he just wanted it more that time he was quicker to the ball 50/50 ball body with kind of a heat check three missing there problem when you get down you think you're going to Quick shot your way back into the game but this a possession by possession thing nice move on Kyle Anderson and he fouled him Anderson was inch a little closer here one stop at a time one possession at a time before halftime fans are aching to get involved but he have had their way Adebayo and he he is one of those guys where five of eight last night not as efficient field goal percentage down this year but B is a stud Andy Waters missing the three and Trayce Jackson-Davis continues to fight Schroder missing a three the Warriors are five of 23 on threes there's opportunities to drive there especially that last one shooter could have eaten up the real estate see what he could do after that Lindy Waters knocked it out of bounds if you're not named Steph like the energy they've shown defensively and Buddy Hield another steal Trayce running and bunking Hammer that over out of you force some turnovers better Sprint out throw it ahead reward the big man for running TJ D's got eight they're still within Striking Distance as bad as it it feels that he aren't running away with it stayed down to that pump fake so did Trayce Jaquez will back it up tjd that's great didn't buy either pump fake for the Jaquez Miss slowmo three he got one his first three of the night his first attempt for slow-mo from Deep that's the new tandem well no one even closed out he had plenty of time to line that one why not take your time two years ago Kyle Anderson was a 40% three-point shooter had the hand injury after the dog bite his three-point shooting went down knocked that one away shot clock at five Adebayo will step into a three and Bam getting it done that was supposed to be a great defensive possession they didn't break the paint at all but bam saved the day lot more competitive the last couple minutes though for the Warriors Anderson two three zone is definitely bothered buddy driving and breaking the paint shoter doing the same tjd couldn't get it off glass mentioned the heat just a couple games ago the seventh best three-point shooting team in the league on 38 attempts Herro bottoming a three right on Q hey he tjd Jovic was he's cheating off of Herro there fire it over to him St is at the scores stable Kyle Anderson shot that shot long and strong and the heat give it back two guys fighting for the rebound Warriors are fortunate there buddy Hield three and Trayce continues to fight for rebounds Draymond didn't settle for that three shot clock at three Steph's got to make something out of nothing buddy to beat the buzzer ripped it out you got multiple drives there though Jovic spinning at 610 and Jaquez bottoming with three Jovic can handle he's got great vision got counter moves the spin move into the pass caught Draymond cheating off his Man 8 of 14 versus 6 of 26 you're going to stay in that zone forever if the team is six of 26 how about that that was beautifully done we saw Tyler Herro trying to guard Trayce just throw it up high who's going to get it so djd 10 points in the paint now Warriors at 20 and the Heat at 22 so the difference is the three-point shooting Jovic will te up a three but he Hield the rebound Draymond good contest he sold out for that Steph Curry and the one guy making him five of nine Steph's got 17 ERS have been down 15 making it 10 right now Roz has the size Advantage shot clock at five skip past to Jovic open Highsmith three and Jaquez walked in for the rebound and that is demoralizing he just weren't able to get a box out after the double team they had you in rotation force a miss and you don't get the rebound Trayce goes right out where Indiana on Indiana but didn't get the bucket Jovic catch and lay it in so it is the heat kind of pushing the lead out a little more getting extension back out to 14 off back iron and my goodness the Warriors seven of 28 on threes step is five of nine it's it's hard to look got caught up in the air they cycle it the hawz and his open three is barely ticked iron and Trayce with the rebound about a 5sec difference 31 31 sh it middle staff bottoms another three six of 10 and he's got 20 in the first half he's unreal man he's doing all he can Jovic to end the half and then need his teammates to come off with the ride the other thing is the Warriors don't really have they their bench you know your leading bench scorer is not in the game and that's kind of showing up this game as well St missing that three to open the second half bam Adebayo with Jaime Jaquez who had 16 in the first half Haywood Highsmith Tyler Herro and Terry Rozier and you got a whistle before that shot Andrew not ready to get back out there initially and so Subs back in for Kyle Anderson it's like that sometimes the game comes back at you pretty quick AIO the Highsmith and close out by Steph shot clock at five Herro bothered by Schroder so the Warriors have played defense on a couple nice possessions for some of the half it's just not making shots it's getting demoralizing you said other than step nobody is having a night Wiggins attacking and tipping in his own Miss he had the small defender Rozier on him throw counter moves at him as you go to the rim and then just stay with it get your own Miss dubs at 34% shooting and the heat were at 50% until that last Miss to open the second half shot clock at three run Herro off the line S step missing that three can he get these defensive rebounds they can't bam Adebayo able to get Rozier downhill it's just Tyler Herro saved it to him and you kind of go for it you're not able to get it you have a bad angle to cut off Schroder’s Lane to the rim and the heat they're going to stay in this Zone look because it's working the Warriors there you go that's the way to dice it up it's just what you tated at half time right there well I like that Schroder was looking for the drive there he's intentional about it and then you see Draymond kind of Flash over into the weak spot that middle man you can get the ball in there yeah Trayce with double figures now I Smith an open three and he dropped it in so the heat nine of 21 Warriors eight of 30 from deep well they're just playing really well raon talking about taking it inside and when you drive TR able to guide it home two k kind of focused on Steph Curry he saw his Defender wasn't in between him and the basket if he just went fast he would have an angle put it up on the rim see if someone can get an offensive rebound if he missed as Smith made one three missing there but Bam gets the heat another possession he's just fighting for it you got to hit him first initiate it step coming up with the steel in on Herro who gave ground and then step missed the lane he was trying to find that body and he said it he gave ground kind of pulled the chair out from under him that's like the fast break version of pull the chair out Tyler Herro missing that three mean the hate we said they've lost three games in a row got blown out at home by Utah lost to Indiana lost that double overtime to sack and sher's first field goal comes at a good time you need someone else to get going man they got Highsmith just face guarding Steph he's not helping off of him someone else has to get aggressive yeah 10 points is nothing in an NBA game it's just that the Warriors have been so dormant offensively for the whole game you're waiting to see if they have a run in them G Rozier will stop and go nice finish little hesitation that's all it took oh that pass nearly thrown away great play by Trayce to avoid the Breakaway layup shot clock at nine am on attacking again throwing it back for Trayce but Adebayo was ready nice Smith nice skip pass to Herro better touch pass to Rozier his three around and out Warriors fortunate I've been a lot of turnovers eight for each team it's just been very poor Warriors shooting prer made a mid-range his first three now he been 0 for five he wouldn't here come the doves he wasn't even expecting that pass so once he got it he's like well might as well shoot this especially if Adebayo is kind of sagging off me fighting over with Rozier good Hustle by Wiggins shot clock at three Jaquez throws it up and in Jaime Jaquez have a game he's got 18 off the Nate basket Wiggins back out to step missed the three there that's what you want though you want to look for more of that guys sprinting throwing it ahead any kind of transition favors the dubs or just like a boa constrictor snuffing the life out of you on both ends all movement and Rozier pays it out of the main three warriors were just a step slow rotating after that double team odd I mean there's some individual success but how five people can play together you're going to see the Valkyries this summer in terms of women's basketball's gone crazy in college and now Pro with the WNBA teamwork leadership saw the world at the Paris Olympics and how great that was the men's and women's side the United States both winning gold on both sides Draymond out of the timeout you saw Steve Cur just dice up that zone it can be done they were patient with it that time they didn't take the first available shot work it around finally the middle opens up you get Draymond inside Dam Adebayo holding on Draymond teammates on the Tokyo Olympic team bam having that knocked away down to three oir with a tough shot and Kyle Anderson played the D Kyle running but he needs people with him they four heat back defensively you want this to be your run right here string possessions together begins on a Jaquez launch the wing jumper they didn't threaten inside that trip down the way the Warriors are shooting from the perimeter can't afford to settle I'm okay with them getting the ball to Andrew Wiggins ISO though we'll see if he can get himself back in the game but you always talk about driv and jump into somebody do something the Warriors have attempted three free throws the whole game speaking of going inside but Sher didn't get a foul there one point game the Heat have had it as high as 15 led by 13 at the half Herro for three Draymond good defensive rebound and he's fouled there he has been quiet at this game two right now Eric SP are just like hey keep running clock and keep trading buckets with a double digit lead the heat blew a 14-point lead with 7 minutes left in Sacramento last night this is a grinded out type of game and with the heat you expect nothing different Wiggins three there you go and Wiggins first three of the night the step as yet to score in the quarter attacking where's going to shoot a three Warriors will lied that where's a 45% three-point shooter doesn't take a lot of them St just turn hits it what a tough shot he hits that three and you start to those screens press nearly the 8sec violation just got it across Jovic to where and Kyle Anderson had pinned him under the backboard shot clock at seven elit driving nice finish made it look like he was going to throw it to where in the post maybe caught Draymond off guard a little bit got a little bit of a step but then that was just power and niic nine Off the Bench slowmo off back iron and just those are the shots that must go against the Zone that's a great look from about 6 feet and then we is fouled well I told you they're going to eventually throw a lob to Ware it was Kel'el we doing the same and couple free throws coming your way courtesy of Kia amazing for the 15th pick he's been a solid player missing second free throw and Moody nearly had it knocked away but recovered not a lot of free throws in the game for either team step he's going to get a jump ball he almost stay away from the turnovers you only have come in here eventually forward momentum here make the heat feel you a little bit yit probably should win this jump ball at 610 probably see how JT or throws it they're just making sure everybody's doing what they're supposed to do around the circle long time deis there noich won it so Tyler Herro with Highsmith Nia Jovic we and Jaime Jaquez Herro Jing that out rebound battle that's when the heat are winning these gilich un a to make the Warriors pay but we couldn't follow it home so the Warriors play defense a couple times there and come up with a stop Trayce down the lane he is fouled as he lays it up and in teamm and Trayce Jackson-Davis with 17 now to back up Curry's 23 the two Warriors in double figures and it's back to six again down 13 and a half time bigest Leep for Miami was 15 Jovic lob where Hammer that I told you bro why would you not just throw it up to him and the only guy down there is shrer who's half his size back in this Zone step Ben The Zone Buster seven of 13 on threes Moody from Deep Moody's first three that pump fakeing sign step three is not as easy as he made it look it just have been hot the last four games he's one of three on threes tonight a banging buping off front iron Warriors playing the D good job by Moody got him further out than he wanted to shoot that buddy for three that's one buddy if he wants to I know he loves his three ball but he's got all that real estate in front of him he could have eaten that up maybe shot a floater inside if you don't want to get all the way to the rim yeah butd he's nine for his last 45 oh now wait a minute I think the NBA is trying to do away with that so I'm going to say that's not a foul I'm just going to say this and and Brian by the way was 8 ft away and was staring at just he he blew a call right there yeah and and the problem is in a tight game when you blow a call and give a team three free throws it's a big deal yeah and Tommy gave us a great angle you could see it the defender is is trying to jump by him he has that right bu he Hield that feels so good he had been one of seven he's made more threes than anyone in the league The Last 5 Years like the the numbers have to come back for him you got a little momentum going into the fourth quarter can you press the hill at any point Jaquez nice drive batt for the rebound buddy comes up with it buddy Running With Friends guys in blue jerseys are with Him slowmo to Trayce Indiana on Indiana is where had him Trayce I was there before you that's the power I me got to show that more try to Cave where his chested tjd with 19 he can do that man Herro with a three Tyler Herro coming alive he had been three of 12 there making it a six-point game trying to kill the Warriors momentum with that one man Trayce that was like when auki went back to Kentucky who do I need a dunk on who played after I graduated he just came with a physicality that time so much more Force shot clock at three moty catching sh three off fire there but a good creation buddy Hield got in the lane KS the free one with about a 5sec game shot clock difference as the Warriors play two for one Jaquez he's got 18 in the game I think he wants the screen I think he wants to go himself Schroder went for the pickpocket shot clock at three Herro from Deep off front iron Warriors have time to work with three but he heals to end the quarter and nearly banked it home but war is credit they they haven't lost their confidence their focus they've stayed with it you know that heat is BS misses a three you know the heat will let you back in and last night given up to 17-point lead you've been down 15 you're here now step Begins the fourth step back on Jovich he was running back gave him the h is at 3-1 in he's got eight Maes and 26 in the game this man is ridiculous Jovic has nothing for that so Jovic and Alec Burks bam Adebayo with Duncan Robinson and Rozier want to live with Burks just shooting wide open threes well Duncan Robinson was screening buddy Hield who was the closest guy to him no one else even tried Steph and Lindy Waters Trayce Jackson-Davis Kyle Anderson and Buddy Hield here jumping at him Lindy wat's a good look at three but Kyle Anderson look what I found and puts it up and in Johnny on the spot right place at the right time again they gave up so many Second Chance points last night you can sneak in there and get a few 15 down within four noic going to call his own number but he fou him before the shot to check to make sure that was going in just a big sh I get it it's so hard to look away man like that's such a long shot to look away and shot clock down to two the O has the Hoist Warriors are playing some D here second half been a lot different and they keep executing offensively EJ D on Burks staff driving on the 610 Jovic splits both Defenders Curry to the Rozier he is a monster but then he kept that dribble low to get in between those two Defenders here's rier being roofed they took it from him dubs can Tire Take the Lead buddy driving step three there listen Steph Curry what okay watch out Trayce Jackson-Davis again but what else is new this man he's the deviation from the norm how do you keep him down triples doesn't matter the reason Steph shot that is the foul occurred before the ball was inbounded which means anyone can shoot the free throw so that's why Steph made it a onepoint game and that one ticked iron there he pump fake from there not too long ago so from down 15 to within one he wasn't bluffing do not give Duncan Robinson any space Adebayo we got Jovic out of the corner that's a nice find from bam and Anderson was spilled as Rozier into him again the heat are an incredibly proud team they're incredibly well coached and they have a toughness to them that really comes from Pat Riley and folster Lindy Waters you would take him shooting that three all day but Lindy is 0 for tonight too Jovich instant replay same result plus a foul Steph's going to give him a four-point play opportunity Well Steph was even though he already well that's the thing about playing from in front like you were talking about is you're the team that's in front you just got to hit a few shots to beat the other team down again and without Podziemski without Gary Payton II withouta the moreor bench is getting run tonight and that's where buddy and Lindy's three-point shooting just hasn't been there corers are a deep team but they're missing three of their top eight players and they're going to miss them for a while St very deep three he's just try to stop in between the two Defenders the top of that zone Alec Burks open transition three so the three-point shooting has been the difference playing inspired basketball they have enough to beat you Kyle Anderson just setting up Draymond for a layup just got to threaten in there first make B on bu respect him that gave Draymond some space for that pass every time they come out of a timeout Steve Kerr's got something against that zone that's worked well they seem to just throw it in the middle which is what you want to do almost every time if you can the Heat have made three straight threes here Robinson attacking and noic have the rebound put it in and draws a foul all teams with 38 points in the paint that's the thing when you're trying to come back from behind you almost need to play perfectly all the little things boxing out and this is what we had mentioned earlier when you're playing with a double digit lead there's not that pressure and so you know the Warriors when they cut it to one you got to Crest the hill and instead it was three straight threes by the Heats sometimes that could be enough to just repel the any kind of thrust Steph Curry's got 31 Bing that home I like Kyle Anderson in the middle instead of attacking that time you just set the hand off screen for step let him get in the middle let him make the decision float game got forever left in the game over seven minutes Al Burks St good close out there Burks been hit wide open threes that was good attentiveness got bam out of the lane kned it away from Draymond it's still Warrior ball you looking for your split action there but bam Anderson to trigger gets it into Draymond finding Lindy and Rozier it oh there we go it's good to get Lindy on the board Draymond just kind of flashed in there the weak spot again Draymond's getting into triple double territory seven points 10 assists nine rebounds Hopkins had a triple double last night against Sacramento Robinson I watched him that whole possession Andrew Wiggins was just trying to stay glued to him off screen just tough to to stay on his back Robinson four four on three you know what he does you know what that guy does now Steph made that but you're going to have a foul reason Steph is subbing out now it takes away the basket Wiggins three and I mean it's not very complicated tonight one team is making threes and one team is not and that's been the difference Adebayo ding that home and then the fifth and one and the way they run though they set him kind of in a little closer get movement into it bam missing that free throw so you look up after you had it down to one and it's a 12-point game three the waters nice little mid-range if you take your time you can kind of inch your way closer to the paint get in there float game can't tray buckets though like we're saying down 10 Adebayo makes it 12 and people will look at these last five six minutes this will be a game that the heat if they win it will be in the first half when they built the 13-point lead Wiggins is stripped Miami came in having lost Indiana got blown out by Utah 136100 lost in double overtime to sack and keep fouling three-point Shooters is Burks he's got 14 points kind of had a tough night it's been everybody else Burks Off the Bench played well Jovic Robinson so Burks three free throws courtesy of Jack move up you know they feel like they're better than they've been able to show this year they're dealing with the Jimmy Butler stuff like guess what you look looking for and it's and some of these wounds are self-inflicted by how the Warriors have begun games particularly at home they were 21- 10 at home or 21- 20 at home last year they're going to be 10 and 10 I mean that that's in their Championship here they were 39 and2 at home like you got to defend your home court at some point I just never found like sustained momentum this game sustained Rhythm offensively against the zone and this is the kind of game you need to Comm in his downhill attack I feel so bad for him hurting the ankle not able to help his brothers tonight but like he just just haven't been able to find it consistently offensively tonight close out on Duncan Robinson there you had a chance when you cut it to one and that chance has gone astray and for the Warriors this will just be a miserable stretch to to go three and six in this nine game stretch with Miami playing a double overtime game in Sacramento Warriors are one of eight on threes here in the fourth while the heat are five of eight Jovic has been the one bothering them Trayce good close out Trayce Jackson-Davis is one off his career high can get him another bucket to be perfect from here on out knock out some threes missing that three the Warriors 14 of 48 on threes this a team that shot 60% Warriors need a miracle now 8786 the Warriors had cut it to one and then a 218 run by Miami make it 238 how does that happen when you're the team that should be rested and have the energy the final 9 and A2 minutes yeah that that zone is rough to deal with if you haven't seen a ton of it you don't have your go-to stuff against the zone another turnover the Warriors only 10 turnovers tonight Miami had eight it's been the three-point shooting and the Warriors overall shooting at 40% for the game and the kind of game that he plays is just the last thing the Warriors want to see right now 27th in Pace they slow it down you're just having to go from half court to half court Rozier hitting that and now Steve Kerr can put in all the reserve Spencer Santos Warriors uh-oh P threw that away the Warriors are dying for just productivity given the injuries and you take for granted what Podziemski does what Gary Payton II does you know what Kuminga has been doing and those are three massive losses and they're just they're not good enough up and down the roster to sustain some of these just just almost inexplicable shooting spells got it really well against Philly really well against Memphis horrendous against Sacramento and just as bad against Miami I just think the balance to their offense like shooting the 483 tonight obviously the Zone kind of induced some of that 24 second violation they did not get a shot up there we always talk about the in three-point attempts Houston points in the paint fast break points like this is what they do free throw line you know even Denver number one when it comes to to points in the paint like there's other ways to attack if you have balance to your offense when you see a Zone you know what to do against it you can do some other things other than shoot threes well especially if you're not making them you're not getting high percentage three-point looks Warriors are going to have a game where they've shot five free throws the whole game and one of them was that foul before the ball was inbounded that that's hard to do on your home floor to shoot five free throws for a game shus Alexander shoots 12 free throws by himself every game I mean that's just his mentality is a driving mentality times Warriors go long stretches of the games without having a driving mentality just looking for opportunities to drive those here missing there but no I think the three-point shot I mean a lot of it's being discussed in the NBA in terms of the volume of Threes but there are good threes and then just very poor attempts at threes think about's missing that as much as people want to talk about people shooting threes the best teams in the west are not necessarily like amazing three-point shooting teams Adebayo is just using clock here they going to sub in a bunch of other heat but this is an impressive win for Miami and sometimes you lose three in a row and they get embarrassed on their home floor and they take it out on somebody and that's what the Warriors want to do on this what I've said it before it can't just be you're making threes you're a good team you're missing threes you're a bad team correct the best teams in the west they have something else they can go to so Miami they lost 128 115 to Indiana 136 to 100 to Utah then lost 123 118 to sack double
