 we see Dennis Schroder in a acquired as the tip is won by jir the four Court looks to turn the corner he'll dump to the corner back it goes to curry curry fakes a three he fires a three hand open the scoring it's in and out and rebounded by moley Cavaliers is going have to do a good job of making sure someone finds Steph Curry in these rotations I mean he's going to look to shoot the basketball he's done it for 16 years he's he's Unstoppable at times but got to get a hand in his face make it difficult for him he struggled a little bit this year shooting the B ball so got to take advantage Mitchell up to an open Wade as Mitchell drew a crowd Jackson Davis plucks it out of the air and here's Draymond Green ring into the four toward Hill Al for Wiggins garlett up ahead to Mobley the C let off the make Mobley got pumped by Jackson Davis nothing called play continues as out trots Wiggins he'll dump off the curry once more to Wiggins he's open bide rebound is grabed by Jackson Davis he tried to throw it off mbly the ball recovered by The Warriors here's Schroder Schroder began the season as a net he'll pedal to the Elbow now Draymond Green takes an 18 footer and that's rebounded by Dean Wade nice defense by the Cavaliers everyone was accountable found a man stuck with that man until the last pass which was a pass to Draymond which was a difficult shot Garland Nails a three off the Donovan Mitchell feed the Cavaliers began this trip in Denver on Friday and threes were flying the Cavaliers at 23 all told scoring 149 points we have a foul on the floor as we take a look at our injury report as always it is brunning and working out with the team no contact as of yet it's good news to hear him moving you that AC injury is a interesting one he's working really hard to get back into this lineup Wiggins one to three Allen however was there green with three on the shot clock Val he'll find Jackson Davis got do a better job communicating on the back side of that Dean Wade comes over to help you got to step in front close off that interior we've seen a couple of those lobs early on so obviously the the Warriors are going to run and try to throw that thing up top catch our guys off guard Mitchell off one leg effortless yeah he can score in punches Schroder directs traffic he's still acclimating himself to this Warrior offense Curry finds green green inside of Jackson Davis he had that blocked by Mobley is put back doesn't go Jackson Davis recovers and the Warriors reset with a fresh 14 Schroder wants a three nice defense by the Cavs Evan did a good job on Jackson Davis stopping that basketball Schroder lines up and takes a nice shot but it was good defensive balance by the Cavs you want to see more of that keep making them take tough shots Mitchell chased by Wiggins he'll step back for three almost dropped on through after the ball hit the back ey Intruder says one head to curry curry in stride across the foul line curls back that three is In and Out Boy Jackson Davis is active inside the ball will go to the Cavalier by referee fenasy Ransom tonight that out works wiggan by Draymond underneath he missed the shot as Wade got a hand up and altered it Mitchell looks to turn the corner he'll fire from the Baseline tough drifting shot by Donovan Mitchell it ties this game at seven yeah the defense actually colls John and no one stepped out to Donovan Mitchell as he fading towards that Baseline normally you'll see someone step up and try to force him or either create a trap a tough shot Williams CS a three the Warriors shoot the fourth most threes in the NBA the Cavs shoot the sixth most lot of volume from long range we have an illegal screen on Allen that's going to wipe off the would be Garland three shrewder he was the system for the Nets yes he was Jackson Davis down by Lane tried to dunk it nothing doing as Mobley was there out strides the seven footer in toward green he knocked him down and it's an offensive foul boy Mobley had a Runway and you like the aggressiveness look the Cavs called time out they looked like they were going to challenge but apparently made the decision that wasn't enough to gain at this early stage of the ball game 10- s is our score wiggin has the basketball he's at the top of the key Draymond hoist to three no good the cows want to make green shootter who that's off the hand of Wade and it will stay with the warrior as part of the game playing against Draymond Green make him a wouldbe scorer instead of a passer which is interesting because he's been shooting the ball relatively well so but yes that would be the the ideology is to get him to shoot the basketball away the ball from Steph Curry and those other guys who shoot it so well gra Cavs grab a steel as Allen shot is blocked true over the warrior logo he's picked up by Allen on the perimeter Garland looks to stay with curry curry penetrates that pass is read by Allen deflected and off it goes to Schroder Schroder got weighed on a fly by he missed so badly and fell right into the waiting arms of Trayce Jackson Davis who dunks to give Golden State a 127 lead Mitchell omah hob got a half step on Curry right to the basket and he lays it in nice job by Donovan not giving up on that play he was looking to make a nice pass and Curry just kind of gave him enough room to make that layup Schroder answers Mitchell Waltz is right around green it's rebounded by Schroder actually well defended by Green he actually able to get a little bit of a hand up in Donovan's Vision alter that shot just a little bit W finds the cover in green darus Garland will orchestrate this offensive sequence he's badgered by shrer up near the timeline Darius hands off the way shter there again darl over the top Wade thises to Allen back to Wade and Wade lays it in wow what great ball PA movement look at Harlem Globe TRS there for just a second I lost the ball John that was great pass from Dean to Jarrett Allen and Jarrett Allen back to Dean within four feet of space excellent Curry Works around the perimeter you know he wants a three Garland rebounds how about the defense by Jarrett Allen on Steph Curry made him take a tough tough shot steep didn't realize he was going to have to shoot over a seven foot oh Garland with the and one as he just cruised right around the tear drop just like you saw there and he looks straight into the sternum of Draymond Green to draw the foul as Max Strus Caris Levert and Georges Niang all file in DG been in the wait room man Warriors make their first substitutions as well as buddy Hield and the redot Jonathan Kuminga check in as cares lbert with a quick steal he took it away from Hield up ahead to Garland Garland knes to the basket he thought he got fouled no they slapped the backboard John but the guys trying to block the shot off slap the backboard Kuminga scores Kuminga has backto back gains of 34 points off the warrior bench both career hides scws from the corner curry with his head up he goes down the lane got to step in front of that he's active with that basketball and and he almost free his guys talking about Steph Curry you got to step in front of him make him Retreat meang for three he's got it yeah we're going to need a lot of that from Georges spotting up knocking down those big threes he didn't care it's going to be vital Buddy Hield lays it in Penny ainson it's a timeout Georges Niang gets called for a travel as we're back underway Cavs checked in tonight with a record of 27 and four put it in perspective before the season began you would have said the Cavs would start seven and four I think we would have said fantastic yeah I agree what a what a wonderful solid start hon 17 and three Curry sends it off to Kuminga back it goes to Buddy Hield Hield up to Kuminga will complete this thought in a Balz Kuminga sends one over to Wiggins Wiggins into the pain tip by Niang and out of bounds if you would have said the CLE start 17 and four you would have said no nobody starts 17 and four in the NBA they're 27 and four starting now has to be the reality it's it's it's living in the moment and playing each game you know getting away from the noise making sure you're focused on what you're doing when you're playing that oppon opponent it doesn't matter the records once that ball goes up in the air you got to play your best every night in Moses Moody who had just checked in was unaware of the shot clock it's a shot clock violation as we paused for a word from Alon jewers discover the Steph Curry gets his first rest as Dennis Schroder returns Garland crosses over Schroder fires a long distance three and drops it straight through well I didn't see that coming Darius was setting up that dribble to go around that screen boy shot a deep deep three buy Hield drives he got there but missed the bunny here's Garland again Garland Works to Intruder dish to Allen he a got dumped inside Allen's jump Hook is true and just like that the Cavs are back within one yeah it's nice to get that ball to Jarrett Allen let's establish a little bit of that interior presence that we have the advantage with as we go forward we have an illegal screen cabs ball a good timeout by Kenny Atkinson as he have these Warriors as bringing Mitchell I should say his shot was off the mark and got deflected over the sideline and out of bounds the ball stays with the Cavs Miss has opened this game with six first quarter points that ball hit buddy Hield's foot last for it rolled over the sideline Mobley pushes one off to Levert Levert accelerates past Moody he'll back in Miss Jackson Davis has healed up ahead only Strus could catch him he'll missed again great Hustle by Max Strus not giving up on that play hustling back causing him to miss that shot good job by Max Str winning plays y Mitchell for three Schroder urges his team ahead he'll find Kuminga shers picked up by LeVert Kuminga from the nail operates on Strus and he gets the roll nice post up by Kuminga right in the middle of the of the lane there early on probably about 12T from the basket might have to get a hand back in there to help Max is a good Defender but g a little bit of help old Le three doesn't go it's just been one of those runs for kaming he has been extremely effective off that Golden State bench he goes to work on Niang Niang gets called for the foul inbound 223 to go in the first those of you joining us late night back in Cleveland welcome aboard getting set for the New Year's holiday we do it again tomorrow night from La celebrate New Year's Eve with you udy to Kuminga Kuminga this time is watched by Mobley H Jackson Davis who almost got stripped from behind by Mitchell oh wild shot doesn't go as Niang was fighting the young man on the inside strews for three wow Mobley gets CAU for a foul shooter got tossed to the leg to leg contact there see the displeasure Adam Mobley what a read byuu knocked that away from Moody up ahead it goes to Levert who tiptoes the sideline now slows down oh oh as a Strus passes behind Mitchell and out of bounds it goes little bit a mistiming there great hustle though by the Cru and Caris getting that ball up into the the front Court very quickly just a little bit of an Eric pass nether team has been particularly careful with the basketball that was the Cav's sixth turnover the Warriors have coughed it up five times Shooter had that knocked away make it six Mitchell was in there nian up ahead to Levert Levert for three hey knocks it down Caris Levert entered action second in the entire NBA at three accuracy he drills a triple here to the home team a tremendous advantage and rhythm of course is such a big part of this sport huge and for two teams that when they're cooking have loads of Rhythm this has been a first quarter that maybe somewhat surprisingly has lacked Rhythm I agree here's moody moody in the corner history is good as M got out there with a contest it didn't matter as Moody hits 60 seconds to go in the first quarter Levert checked by by Buddy Hield he wants to take Buddy he crossed him over Levert those choppy moves can't get the 12-footer to go Moody rebounds Schroder he'll look over at his new head coach Steve Kerr stes in his 10th season here with the Warriors Schroder works on Strus that shot was short Mitchell has the loose ball that caps up numbers if they hurry Mitchell over the top of Hield finds leer in the Corner Mitchell knocks it off the board what a play there by Mitchell as it came to Mobley and Mobley got fouled Donovan Mitchell knew exactly what he was percentage to 44% for the season he scored 26 points he has 20 or more in six of his last eight and he's averaging a career high 19 a night he had some big threes too I mean threes whatever kind of challenging him in the motion of the offense to shoot it and he did really nice clut ones in the second half in particular as levert boots that Curry feed with four ticks to go in the first that's what he does I mean he brings the activity the aggression he just gets after it Caris LeVert does on both ends of the floor and uh Caris is just the guy you got to have on your basketball team to go win Moody to trigger Curry dumps off to Kuminga Kuminga lines up a three air mails it first place Knicks are playing really good basketball watched a couple of their games over the last week so we've been traveling and they and they are Brunson is back to being a monster they're they're really really good going to be fun to watch us we match up with it can't wait that would have been Mobley's third as Kuminga thought he got foul moley starts the second quarter Strus has it go out of bounds last off Kuminga Strus moley Mitchell Levert and Niang open this second quarter green curry Kuminga and Lindy Waters who sees his first action wow Draymond Green just dragged Georges Niang to the floor those are two combustible sorts 26 seconds cooler heads prevail yeah good screening by Georges if you're feeling uncomfortable here early in the second quarter and you're not sure why the last time the Caps trailed going into the second quarter was over a month ago November 29th the game against Atlanta they have not trailed going into the second quarter in a month thought it was those three hot dogs no that wasn't it okay here's curry curry Works around Mobley Mobley has to be careful as Mitchell read that wiggin feed and knocked it out of bounds that's interesting well like I say first quarter is a little sloppy on both ends that was close to a 5sec count as Waters takes the inbound feed that's swatted right into the hands of Donovan Mitchell Wiggins got a piece of it Levert looks to go Baseline on green took a bump nothing called it's sails out of bounds Warrior ball opening minute second quarter Warriors 27 Cavaliers 26 Curry is watched carefully by stroops Green trying to find Kuminga it went right past him Levert with his head up he'll dance into the four Court play through mbly oh Jesus the C continued it this made gun Forest there as that's their his defense has been excellent against the Warriors and did for the Cavs just on the the perimeter you know Evans down in the middle of the of the drive go ahead and pass that basketball cuz the defense is so far up maybe cut behind it get down to the post real quick greay green dries floats and he gets caught for an offensive foul it was Strus who took the blow Draymond wants a coach's challenge he barks and called a timeout as that pass t for Sam arell goes AR back comes curry curry throws on the brakes Cavs show him a wall Curry now fires over that wall SCU rebounds Curry's opened this game 0 for four from three-point range Mitchell works right around lendy Waters finds Merrill for a stand still three this rebounded by Waters both instances in the first half coach called a quick timeout said something out toward the official which looked like it was perceived to be a coach's challenge it was announced over the PA as a coach's challenge then later twice reversed said no challenge it's simply going to be a timeout so here's Jonathan Kuminga who gets word decisive especially with their Cuts just paying more attention to those decisions they're making on the offensive end yeah it's a good point because on the offensive end what I'm seeing as the Cavaliers are looking they're following that basketball and you have an idea of where you're supposed to be offensively as you run the offense you got to make your Cuts make them decisively take your guy with you drag him through all of the mins of that offense which is so Dynamic and then if you're open you catch basketball you get a shot but everybody's kind of stopping and hesitating hoping to make these big plays on the offense when we have enough Firepower that if we just execute we can get to what we want in the offensive end tobly meanwhile inside that's rebounded by Kuminga MGA slams into moley Moley with the rejection but he gets caught for the foul that's going to be three on Evan s CS take advantage of it Ken's at 62% on the season as Lindy Waters was grabbing it former Warrior Ty Jerome who has checked in all tied did in the first meeting between these teams was score 20 points in 21 minutes and go seven of eight from the field well we could use a a healthy dose of Ty Jerome tonight he absolutely lit him up last opportunity he got against him Mitchell finds throughs now it's Jerome Jerome got fouled by Curry now it's Curry's turn to be dissatisfied the fouls on the floor as we pause for a word from Wayside Furniture don't miss Wast Mitchell got knocked down by Wiggins he remains down the ball goes to the Warriors whoa Kuminga just stepped over the the top of Mitchell and you saw the glare and now Strus is over there having wor with Kuminga Ed Malloy appears perturbed I think Donovan Mitchell got hit in a solar plexus remember that from the wrestling days I do old professional wrestling got to get hit in solar plexus it's not comfortable no first he went down maybe here's Curry he'll drive it toward moley throw high off the window that doesn't go it's grabbed by Strus well you don't see Steph Curry miss a lot of those just got having a bad run of shooting it right now Strus up to an open Mitchell barl grabs the long rebound Mitchell Cuts takes the feed reverses loose Ball's grabbed by Draymond Green who's back in the ball game Kuminga off the Wiggins again this game is Desperately Seeking some Rhythm from either Club on the offensive end Kuminga looks to penetrate he got cut off by Merrill wat side steps J roome Mitchell huls in a rebound with one arm and deal to Max Strus Merrill looks to accelerate he got cut off by a reaching Curry that knocked down boldly for three Curry off the Wiggins green over the top Wiggins floats it up and floats it in C's got to be a little more patient on the offensive end let's get some more Cuts let's get the basketball on that post a couple of times to Heaven see if Draymond can guard him one1 or if it's going to force a double team I think that'll open up three-point shot a little bit better Jerome for three he knocks it down believe it or not those two field goals are the first of this entire second quarter foul will be on Jerome as he was battling Kuminga down the floor nice pass by Donovan a hard drive down that strong side of the lane stopping the game and checking everything 709 to go in the first half what do you think about that Wiggins will send it in bounds let the game go to got to get a rhythm going in the game can't stop check on everything come on that's no foul keep it going yeah there's no question it's been a choppy first half of play as shrer he'll find Waters waters for three and we have people back home staying up late to watch this thing yeah let's go come on stop and see check somebody's temperature some tired eyes home as Wade fires a three some threes by the Cavs I think would perk some folks up in Northeast Ohio need Schroder looking to dance behind a Jackson Davis screen that was way short it never had a chance as Wade grabs the loose ball and out trots Garland Garland works on wigg is the one time Cavalier draft pick Garland left hand he's got it as Darius Garland gives the Cavaliers the lead love it something going to the basket after you know having futility shooting the basketball go to the basket try to create an opportunity that was great by darus shooter appear to get hit in the face play continues shooter from the elbow lost for Jackson Davis and he stepped on the Baseline as the scrambling has continues neither team has shot it well at all here in the second the Cavs are two of Nine the Warriors but one of eight yeah it's just been a really ragged basketball game it's one of those games you got to figure out how to win it you got to figure out how to cut through that that ragged chewed up part of it Shine wade back to Merrill off to Jerome Jerome fakes a three Waters ran him off the line Jerome goes all the way now finds Garland the shot clock shows two fires from the coffin corner it's grabbed by Wade who Savages The Possession now Jerome on the carousel he'll deal to Garland who's in the other Corner Wiggins rebounds at this point of the first meeting the Cavs had 60 points Wiggins line dries a three that's rebounded by Garland Jerome now he has his head up he wants a three and he's got it Ty Jerome points at the warrior bench arsenal of of players and find someone that can get hot and kind of carry the moment for the team to build some momentum Schroder bounces inside of Jackson Davis say Mir thought he got it cleanly a foul however is called on Sam the threes have been flying from this team this season the Cavs lead the league in three-point accuracy and field goal percentage their offense not surprisingly is rank number one under five to go here in the second quarter Jerome sprays it off the Merrill now it's Wade way Allen wanted that ball inside as we have an offensive foul called on Merrill we've had a lot of fouls we've had a lot of turnovers that was the Cavs 11th of this first half not common on this floor but he healed Warriors can D you up on this floor they'll get after you and usually they run away from you but they're just not shooting it as well either it's been a tough night heal up to Jackson Davis and all was there Jackson Davis missed twice good job by Jarrett intimidating that shot nothing's going down for the Warriors got to keep it that way got to start making some shots Jerome off one leg he'll kiss it in wow what a shot by Ty Jerome excellent kamanga skips around a screen he gets two feet in the P these teams have had to work for every single point here in this first half Jerome Badger by Schroder that's rebounded by Kuminga Jerome continues to talk of that Warrior Bez it was Draymond Green who stood up and was most demonstrative in responding to Ty Jerome they seem to have a running conversation truder down the lane Bon Allen was there he sores it he can't hit Jackson Davis uses his side he brought it down and almost lost it Wiggins Way Off Allen snatches it off the floor Jerome has Garland go tending count the basket wow I don't know what to say and then Ty roome nice little Outlet pass getting a layup for the Cav so Cav is deing it up Wiggins Euro steps his way to the paint wi Wiggins now has nine points and he's the high Warrior Garland leads the Cavs with a dozen Jerome wants another three Kuminga he's picked up by Levert now Allen Kuminga strength is getting downhill and the Cavs have not let him do that here through two quarters yeah got a good pick on Caris and Jarrett did a good job of stepping over picking up Kuminga may have Tak an off balance shot Garland got Hield in the air what a pass to Allen as Allen Banks it in that's where Darius Garland is the best in the league at just using that Cadence to get you off Rhythm and Jarrett Allen with those reliable hands always gets a good opportunity just so under control as Schroder plays through Jackson Davis steps back fires a long two that thugs off the backboard and comes right to Dean Wade Levert now as we approach the two-minute Mark he got a half step on Wiggins Levert deals to Allen Allen floats it up and in nice job by LeVert Levert's so active he has everyone you know watching that basketball and he gets a little pump fake everybody's head goes up Garland and the Cavaliers have taken an eight-point lead just like that excellent job by Darius Garland reading that defense just like a defensive back there you see the Cavalier run over the last 5 and a half minutes Curry's been sitting at the scorers table for about three straight minutes of play there have been and no stops Hield once a three steps into it a gang rebound as Wade the man who comes up with it lbert slows he'll get to the foul line Wade alone Allen another rebound he'll send it all the way up top the Cavs reset Garland Jackson Davis rebounds boy good job by Jarrett Allen just grinding down there keeping that ball alive offensive rebound that's a possession for your team Cavs had a good opportunity there Kuminga down the alley he's very elusive his moves John famingo like you say gets downhill very explosive fak me out on that one he's the first Warrior into double figures he had 21 in the first meeting between these teams coming off backto back 34-point games Garland took a bump from Wiggins and almost went in what a for Garland orchestrating composed getting the Cavaliers set up Jarrett Allen has come alive here late in this second quarter nice pump fake by Caris Levert getting the big two coming here for Garland secure your spot for next season's Cavs United memberships by placing

go he tried to go right through whoa Dean Wade and now a fouls called I think that's going to be on Garland as Kingo was trying to go over the top of play through it Cavs had one to get so the Warriors inbound finally Curry and Draymond Green get into the B get into the ball game shooter late in the shot clock SS went off to an open green Cavs give it to him and maybe that's why Wade with the loose ball have to move here to get over this timeline beat the 8C count and Garland just does garet feeds Mobley Mobley for three and is appreciate it all thank you guys yeah I I I I totally agree I don't think it's AB offensive end that we're not getting we're getting good looks defensively we're playing big rebounds in the first half he now has nine points the Cavalier lead is five yeah I was impressed with him his athleticism very aggressive on that offensive board he's got good hops looking young young Prospect Mitchell works on Wiggins get in the paint got to Dart one off to Allen out of bounds it went now Jackson Davis wants a coach's Challenge from Steve cerr as the call is Cavs ball Steve checks with his assistance and the Cavs get the ball in in time three I think the Warriors just took twoo much time as Kur started yelling but the Cavs had inbounded the ball they take this 4941 lead yeah I was looking right at Steve and he was waiting to get the okay and just a second too late a foul is called it's on the flo most since Donovan has entered the league Wiggins lines up a three Allen rebounds Curry is still hot that wasn't a shooting foul Curry was held at two points in the first half and I started to say Brad you don't want to send him to the line and let him see the ball go through the hoop as Mitchell finds another triple Donovan Mitchell opens the third quarter with Beck to back three yeah just comes down to the Cavs making some shots distancing themselves they're good enough defensively to to hold the fort down so make some shots one shot for the Warriors get on that back backboard get that rebound get in the passing Lane be aggressive Draymond Green finds Dennis Schroder Schroder Maneuvers down the alley runs out of room as Allen stayed with him step for step Schroder lay the shot clock as that erased by Jarrett Allen he was going to trick Jarrett and try to get a foul on Jarrett smart play Jarrett hands high Mitchell again hey knocks it down nice job Donovan Mitchell starting to feel it starting to warm up could be trouble for the Warriors I love the I love the possessions last three by the Cavalier has been very aggressive offensively Mitchell is on a personal 90 run Draymond Green has a word with Steph Curry Mitchell bombing away here inside Chase Center quick 10 point moley tips that Draymond Green pass shrer watch watch by Wade Draymond tries to draw a foul he gets it Allen picks up the personal The Barking continues between these two clubs Draymond turns and gives a bit of theatrics there I mean the defensive standing rebounds four assists a couple of blocks he shoots free throws this season at 62% and he misses his first boy what a contrast between theair Ju by the Cavaliers Draymond Green just missed both Cavs and Denver score the most points they ever have in franchise history on the road most points ever in a non overtime game Garland dumps off toward Allen it gets deflected back to a standing Mobley who can a three he has absolutely become a back breaker on shooting that three in critical moments big shot by Evan Mobley in the first half they've hit their first four here in the third quarter it's a rocket morgage feature about the second half there's Jackson Davis with the dunk the Warriors started the third quarter that way going inside of the youngster Jackson Davis they come out of the timeout the same way Mobley in the corner sends it back to Mitchell three minutes in third quarter Mitchell works on Wiggins had to sweep one off the Wade eventually it gets there and Wade hits the three the Cavaliers have opened the this third quarter with five straight triples yeah that's the type of shooting we're used to seeing out this Cavaliers team they just started out a little bit slow now they're starting to get a little bit of Rhythm based on Donovan Mitchell's three threes early nice shot by Dean Wade garet off to Mobley moley takes his time and lays it in after the Draymond Green Miss at the other end and just like that the Cavalier lead has ballooned to 20 yeah you mix it in and you're getting these these easy shots as well you just don't settle for the threes that separate you but then you keep chipping away inside wigg sent it right into the legs of Jackson Davis Mitchell for three he knocks it down the Warriors have had no answer for Donovan Mitchell here in the third green misses his putb doesn't go he missed it again out of bounds the officials compare notes and the ball will stay with the Warriors Curry there to squeeze between two of the Cavaliers shrewder with a contested three and to fire that one into the rafters bobley gets called for a foul that's going to be the fourth on Evan really odd to see Steph Curry not making a flurry of shots been struggling a little bit shooting that basketball and continuing tonight but you know he's what he's capable of at any time tangled up there 726 after one quarter since then they have outscored these Warriors 406 moley heads to the Cavalier bench with those four fouls Kenny will go a little smaller here as Caris Levert checks in mang's left a couple of free throws at the line here tonight he hits that one he has 10 off the Golden State bench Mitchell picked up by Wiggins crossed him over that one doesn't go little bit of a heat check there Curry looking to get going he veers off a green screen Curry way off play by Garland as trud tried to throw it off Garland Garland just plain caught it and then before he fell out of bounds he sent it back into a teammate terrific pass there to Allen Allen down the lane Kuminga has his head up thinka thought about feeding Draymond Green instead keeps it now try to jump off the green who almost fell out of bound back to Kuminga a ragged possession ends up in the hands of Curry Kuminga again and Allen's going to make him earn it it's a good foul there but is good foul kaming almost walked it looked like the walk that you mentioned Brad we'll call it EV he hits the free throw he has one more coming Bud he Hield Jacks in it replace Dennis Schroder One Max Strus returns for the Cavs so it's Wade Allen Levert Garland and Strus it's a 20-point game again Levert watched by Kuminga got a half step found the runway Kuminga commits the foul he's holding to his head he may have got chopped by a sharp Levert elbow like pause for a word from Ken Ganley Kia we've got the gives the Cavs a 6746 lead John Michael Brad Dy and Serena Winters late night basketball back in Cleveland you started to doze off during the second wake up gavs have started firing away from distance here in the third and there's Dean Wade he rejects that Buddy Hield effort what a great defensive play by Dean Wade coming over being the weak side help showing his shot blocking proudness as well Strus for three Wiggins amples into the four Court he looks to drive on Wade and gets there wi Wiggins now has 11 Allen wants Garland he'll get it there Dar takes a dribble returns it Jarrett flips it up at the left hand and scores nice two-man game by Darius and Jarrett Jarrett do reliable hands once again Curry finds his first three on his six shot from deep and 35 meanwhile the Cavs have the basketball coming out of this timeout Georges Niang checks in he'll join Levert Strus Allen and Garin Garin played by Wiggins deals to Allen Allen finds meang meang tiptoes Baseline Garland for three hey knocks it down the Cavaliers hit six threes in the first half they already have seven here in the third quarter Kuminga looks to twirl on Niang tries it again that pass finds Draymond Green now to Curry Draymond gets it back Hield side step struce that Ball's Tipp by Curry and out of bounds it belongs to the C yeah nice job by Georges that room for that rebound Garland Strus finds Levert Allen wants it he gets it returns it to Levert and Levert lays it in lbert took off buddy Hield was behind talking about giving him the keys to the to the engine and trusted it and it's been fantastic Curry step had two points in the first half he has a couple of Threes here in the third G finds the trailer Allen look out nice job Jarrett Allen trailing the play made himself very available to Georges as Georges was posted up that is a nice job by Jarrett Allen great great attack Curry whats another three that's an air ball as Allen was there with the contest Mayo for the seven-footer Garland pestered by Moses Moody who has just checked in Garland sheds him dumps it back to screws extra pass to Levert Levert puts it on the floor nice to the basket Allen there with a rebound the put back is good once again he battled Nick jic on Friday night all night long tireless work by Allen he un launes a three Allen's there for the rebound he'll Outlet the strews here come the Cavaliers Garland for three boy they had a good transition break there Warriors struggling to get back on defense Cavaliers had number Hield on the carousel Kuminga trucks toward dang some contact Kuminga goes down and Niang gets wh and Todd Drome going into halftime just gave us a little shot in the arm just enough to separate and going at halftime and and coach aens has just done an excellent job of putting the guys in position through you a little bit of conversation at halftime on what needed to be done and the Cavs are being a mature basketball team they're executing excellent Steve CER remarked about what what a unique opportunity it is for Kenny ainson stev that have reminded him of when he took over a warrior team for Mark Jackson that had won 50 games the season before he said new head coaches typically don't get really good teams that's right and we know what Steve CD did with that club yeah no doubt about four straight finals great comparison Caris lbert steps back after shed and Hield rebounded by Kuminga the Cavalier lead is 8056 this is a warrior team that can get hot in a hurry they can score in bunches Moses Moody for three in other words no time to Exhale Strus lost it there you see the threes this quarter that's told the story in this second half Kuminga watched by LeVert downhill is tough to deal with but BT made a really nice play to sty that drive Mitchell in transition he's got it Bo that's almost like a layup for Donovan Mitchell what a transition shot three-pointer in transition flowing away from his body away from the basket nothing but Net 5 threes for Donovan Mitchell here in this third the Cavs have gotten separation Kuminga underneath Mobley defends Kuminga has it once more tries to put it up it's blocked by Mobley Levert has Strus he finds him he gets it back and he couldn't get it to go Moody Jackson Davis ran over Strus and that's an easy call and boy does that takes a Moxy and some gumption to stand in 80 Seconds to go in the third Strus for three Curry's picked up by LeVert near the the timeline tries to create some space m there over the top it goes Jackson Davis lays it in he's had a nice night 13 points and 14 rebounds for the seconde man out of Indiana hey you don't mind that too much you want to force Curry make sure he turns into that paint don't let him get hot he start to heat up just a little bit you'll live with that Mitchell backs up he looks to set up Curry he'll fire another three Curry bounces through to Jackson Davis here's moody moody cruises Baseline the warriors with backto back buckets that has not happened a lot uhoh here tonight it as that's knocked away from Levert Kuminga in toward Niang Niang commits the foul the Warriors looking to gain some momentum here laid in the third 28 seconds count unless you have a transition opportunity go down to try to get some execution out of that offense they've separated while making big shots but now you have this substantial lead you want to maintain that the foul onang is his SP kickoff 2025 with some fun you can join us for mascot night at Rocket mortgage Fieldhouse on Sunday January 5th the Cavs take on the Hornet tip time at get your titney ainson Cavaliers are a sparking 17 and one in their own building 10 and three on the road there's a 4 second difference between shot clock and game clock M over the top to Mitchell NE got his hand in there to knock it away so a couple of empty possessions in a row for the state has so much you know they're they're a veteran basketball team so you got to really put them away if you can Kuminga waiting seconds uh-oh oh RS out has Dodge a big bullet Curry once again can't believe it the third quarter is over Mitchell around in Allen Street up the top strs for three got it that's a big shot for Max well we needed to see that ball go in for Max it's a good shot he's getting some good opportunities nice pass by Donovan good trust in Donovan too sh ma got to shoot that basketball be ready those are Max's first points on his six shot Schroder Allen picks up another foul that's his fifth I think that's one Jarrett would before or after the gather Allen and Kenny's argument is that it clearly happened before that ball was gathered so Allen sits with five here in the fourth Dean Wade and Georges Niang are in the ball game Ty Jerome has reentered after an effective first half want have utiliz the guards to help rebound this basketball without Jarrett Allen and Evan on the floor which very capable of doing mitel accelerates inside tough move yeah that was just a strength move he just went right through his Defender got hit on the arms and still just powerful enough to get the ball up needed that bucket now he got to come down defend Lindy Waters rebounded by Wade I like it saw four jerseys box out Dean Wade go get that rebound nice job Mell again on the bounce off a knee screen Jackson Davis has his career high 16th board Schroder cars his way inside got to for Schroder towards the sideline a little bit more make him run Baseline underneath that basket don't let him get in the middle of the floor if you can help it samrow bothered by Kuminga Feats neing and gets it back brilliant Ball workor by Niang and Merrill for the Merrill layup really nice give and go between Georges and Sam good communication Jackson Davis had it knocked Away by Wayne and out of bounds that was an odd play Dean so he hit the safety valve and got it right back and there's a steal Niang comes up with the loose ball Jerome has his head up Ty Jerome finds Wade he's got it nice job Ty Jerome head up just like you're talking about John he's surveying the floor had made up his mind he was going to make a big play with Dean Wade there if the defense stopped him stepped in front of tydd Drome he made that pass yes good job Wade has eight points to go along with nine big rebounds shter three is good four of 11 from the field he now has a dozen points Mitchell in control scoots right around shrer he left that shot short Kuminga rebounds he's guarded by ni m dumps it back to Schroder gets it back here's Jackson Davis he bangs and misses as barl was right there boy the Warriors have missed a handful of shots all night long from the doorstep Vel whs feeds Jerome for three extra pass to Meo got it excellent ball move by the Cavaliers Donovan Mitchell drawing all of that intentional de Curry has re-entered along with Draymond Green green got his signals cross with curry and it comes to Jerome Merrill puts it up he missed it Jerome's follow as he got fouled green and Curry fumbled the ball on the offensive end on the line 801 to go Jerome played couple of seasons ago with these Warriors it's his first free throw last season was effectively a Lost season for tyo played only the first two games into this right angle that eventually required surgery did not play again but he came into camp in terrific shape and he has been a huge part of a Cavalier bench it's a big reason why this team is 27 and four Curry has Merrill draped all over him he still fires a three and hits yeah there's been nights where Ty Rome has just absolutely been able to ignite this Cavaliers offense and he's had some big big moments throughout the season so great to see him back see him Health he's worked so hard to get back in this position roome opens up Niang as two of The Warriors wiped out Wade grabs the offensive rebound Garland for three Wade again he lays it in what a great effort by Dean Wade got the initial rebound through just effort nice pass hustled back clean that up good job Dean Wade great great effort that was rebound number 12 in 24 minutes for Wade as we have a whistle the foul is on Merrill so Wade just don't box out you you're going to get beat this Le dinga looks to work on Wade couldn't shoot it Schroder spins one back to Moody Moody to the foul line takes a 15-footer and he gets the roll Cavs 100 Warriors 80 under seven to go jerom and Merl play catch thr thought about a three got bumped by Kuminga foul is on the floor Direction prior to the contact ball Securities at a premium here at spins hard off Kuminga the shot however does not go MinGa has played a lot of minutes recently for Steve Kerr tonight is no exception Kuminga for three that was poked by Draymond he tried to get it over to Schroder but that was read by Garland as Garland deflected it off to Wade and Out Come the Cavs with this 20-point lead that's what you love as a big guy Dean Wade in there boxing out wrestling with those guys and the ball he can't get his hands up the guard steps back and makes the play happen Garland and he a play catch Garland gets there he Twirls and scores Cavs 102 Warriors 80 what a play by Darius Garland man he was all off balance was able to catch that ball and pette through the air nice touch Curry's picked up by Merrill Now by Niang Curry quick release rebounded by Jerome good defense by Georges Niang you know he's going to step back and shoot that three every time very rarely is he going to drive past you so don't give it to him J has that blocked by Curry and off the Baseline Garland basketball Dean Wade checks out Dean played great man he grab a career-high 13 rebounds tonight in just 25 minutes needed every one of them too on a night remember as Jerome works his way to the pain that was blocked by K and Mobley get it back sted to say on a night when Mobley has been in foul trouble Allen's in foul Buble Moody gets bumped and down by Marrow he puts it up and in and has a chance for three markable on both ends of the floor hit a couple big threes just really played well instrumento in the win on Friday against Denver just another body to throw it Nick yage who can switch onto Jamal Murray deal with the size of Porter that's right we approach the 5 minute mark That's batted out of bounds by shrewder the shot clock sh is going to be a real asset as they go deeper into the season veteran man he's so poised I think with Steph Curry they're going to figure it out the playoff time they're going to be a problem Garland right around Schroder finger rolls and scores Darius Garland has 25 points and seven assists he's given the Cavaliers a 21-point lead but tonight he's got his hands full with Darius Garland who is just eating this Golden State Warriors back court alive fou is caught on Garland who was trying to fight over a green screen and it's almost been kamango will shoot free throws 11 and 12 as we paused for a word from Kia here's Ty jome Dr got bumped by Quinton post who has just checked in Garland saes went over to Levert LeVert three is through oh good ball Movement by the Cavaliers nice fluid throughout the entire possession ended up with an easy shot not having to dribble the ball making sure it goes through the air by the pass just really nice the Cavaliers need two more triples as Kuminga gets fouled again that one's on Mobley and that's his fifth so Kuminga with 405 to go will shoot two more you can download the Cavs app to play Cavs pickup for a chance to win a pair of Cavs United memberships and over $150 in
