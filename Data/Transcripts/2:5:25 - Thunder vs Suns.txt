 the OKC Thunder NBA Wednesday continues presented by State Farm Chell night in Oklahoma City of course another big day of trades in the NBA trade deadline tomorrow so less than 24 hours of high anxiety for players and teams we got a good match up tonight the best record in the NBA the Thunder against a talented Suns team trying to find that consistency and also a match up of two super talented guards MVP Contender Shai Gilgeous Alexander forc and the brand new all-time leading score of the Phoenix Suns Devin Booker and good evening everyone with Tim legler Mike Breen on on hand George Sano Willis as well everybody just wants to talk about trades but there are still games to be played and for both of these teams this is an important game let's start with the Thunder 39-9 best record in the league this is a magical season What In Your Eyes makes them so good they have set the bar very high every other team in this league right now is trying to figure out what Oklahoma City is doing on the defensive end of the floor they are dominant they've got great individual Defenders they've got great Concepts and they have got great commitment to each other on that end of the floor if defense wins championships they're laying the foundation but none of that's going to matter if you don't have something on the other end that's special and they do Shai Gilgeous Alexander again putting up monster numbers meanwhile Kevin Durant missing he's got a spring Tacko so Durant will not play in his former are hometown of the OKC Thunder but when you look at this team when Durant plays there's so much talent yet they're only a game over 500 why are they not winning more it has not clicked Mike the way we expected it all to when they came together part of it is lack of availability man they just haven't had enough of a constant run together but that's not the only reason there's something about their offense that just has not been as fluid as you would expect Mike buer thinks it's incrementally getting better let's see if they can take another step forward tonight all be it without Kevin Durant well when Booker and Durant play together they're 23 and 11 pretty outstanding record but that will not be the case tonight with Durant missing this game as we look at tonight's starting lineup brought to you by Icy Hot so with Duran out Grayson Allen's going to get his second start of the Season Royce O'Neal also getting a start tonight for Mike Boler and the Suns meanwhile for OKC little change in the starting lineup K Wallace is out so Aon Wiggins will get his 16th start playing some excellent basketball this is one of the great atmospheres in all of basketball and it's also one of the toughest places to win they are an incredible 22 and3 here on their home floor and Nick Richards of course a brand new member of the Phoenix Suns acquired just a couple weeks ago we've got a whistle already shot clock did not start so a little attend to that now is that a sign of bad things ahead I'm wondering myself Mike what that means maybe another trade went down and we're pausing to hear about it it has just been an incredible couple of days and there's still a lot of talk about some other trades but some big names are already headed elsewhere more on that later Phoenix 10 and 15 on the road as we mentioned just a game over 500 Allen kicks it out Booker up top to O'Neal good ball movement but excellent defense O'Neal long three-pointer got it Royce O'Neal a good three and D player and getting a start here tonight for the Phoenix Suns and very important the ball change sides of the floor the way it did on that possession against Oklahoma City Jalen Williams pulls up that jump shot is good one of the cool things in the last couple of weeks a much deserved first Allstar selection for Jalen Williams yeah very complete player and he puts up those complimentary numbers for Shai every night but man can he defend how about the nice start from three-point range for Phoenix that's one of the things they want to do they want to shoot more threes as Gilgeous Alexander rattles that one in from good shooting to start four straight buckets yeah speaking of shooting more threes Shai Gilgeous Alexander shooting at a higher volume than he ever has throughout his career really added that to his repertoire this season bucker Off the Mark there's here's Wiggins Wiggins has had some big games lately coming off the bench Gilgeous Alexander to Hartenstein the floater is good well they are the number one defensive rated team in the NBA the Thunder off but they're also pretty darn good on the offensive end the sixth rated Tyus Jones missfires all four field goal attempts for Phoenix from three-point range Gilgeous Alexander he loves that spot he loves to D minate that area of the floor between the elbows out to the three-point line it's the best I've ever seen really at controlling that area with the live dribble because of his ability to stop quickly and shoot that pull up hooker whips a pass great ball movement Jones goes up top to Allen Allen off the bounce goes it Hartenstein back shot misses Nick Richards right there on the follow you like Richard's addition I do he gives them athleticism on the glass he's come in and been very productive particularly as a rebounder but he can make plays offensively athletically that some of their other centers can't grabs the rebound this is just his 10th game since they acquired him from Charlotte Booker off the bounce double team Royce O'Neal tries again and hits again so O'Neal off to an excellent start couple of three-pointers Phoenix up two career high this year for Royce O'Neil 9.2 points over 40% from the three-point line Gilgeous Alexander too strong O'Neal grabs a rebound Fenix comes in with a two- game losing streak lost twice in Portland as Booker gets inside count it and a foul good hard drive from Booker and a chance for a three-point play one of the few times you will see a Phoenix Sun in this game beat somebody off the dribble without seeing another defender in his path at some point before he gets to the rim and maybe that's why Mark dnot has called a it's time for tonight's big deal moment brought to you by Walmart and the big deal moment is that the Oklahoma City Thunder are on Pace for a franchise record in victories this season obviously a lot of that has to do with Shai Gilgeous Alexander an MVP candidate again for the second season but when I spoke to Mark dagal it's about how Shai makes the game so much easier with for his particular teammates about how it's so easy to play with him on so many different levels but it's not just that it's the eess portion of this team how they understand the pecking order as a young group you don't see that very often with a young team where they understand Shai's going to eat first then it's going to be Jalen Williams and Chad holr when he's healthy and then the rest of the role players again not something that's very common place in the NBA with a team as young as OKC who's the youngest team in the league Mike all right George thank you basket down the other end Allen runs into it kicks it out Jones Jones knocks down the three you know talking about Gilgeous Alexander he is everything you want in your face of the franchise player no doubt and one of the great points that Mark dagnal made was his ability to get his own and Hunt as an aggressive scorer without negatively affecting the rhythm of everybody else that is a very hard thing to find in your best player Wiggins on the follow there Wiggins coming off a couple of nights ago the best game of his life a 41-point game getting the start Mark egel likes to do that once in a while on that fifth starter Han of alternates it every once in a while bucker catch shoot fight for the rebound Hartenstein and Gilgeous Alexander picks it up Gilgeous Alexander in the paint draws the foul and he will get to the free throw line where he is an elite free throw shooter just under 90% as Jones picks up his first one of the things that makes him so special you talk about the area of the floor that he operates in why is that so important because it's the most difficult area on the court to run extra traffic at a at a ball handling cuz he can see everything on the court pocket passes are available lobs Corner kickouts when you're operating where he loves to and that is why he's such a challenge for teams well this game could be built the the monsters of the mid-range between Gilgeous Alexander Booker obviously Durant's not playing but that's where he has been lethal throughout his career Jalen Williams as well I put in that category as a great mid-range player who zone defense here from the Thunder tius Jones floaters up that won't go Richard tried to keep it alive buers Alexander comes away with it Allen guarding him L Dort aring three boy that one was launched up high as Booker comes the other way nice feet oh knocked away just about to say nice feet and jayen Williams gets in the passing Lane wiggin and that's what makes the Thunder go no one converts turnovers the way the Thunder do they just make you pay and that's what Mike buer said before the game number one thing top of the Whiteboard take care of the basketball first turnover at Sun there's another turnover Booker threw it away Gilgeous Alexander drives gets inside missed the layup but Jalen Williams right there on the follow and backto back turnovers lead to easy buckets down the other end timeout Phoenix Thunder back up by two NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm meanwhile on Saturday match up on ESPN 4 Eastern the Lakers Luca donic expected debut with LA host the Pacers game also available on ESPN plus and Disney plus everybody still talking about that trade Anthony Davis has yet to play for Dallas and now everybody talking about the Jimmy Butler trade you know leg you a night like say the night before the trading deadline how much anxiety is in the locker room how much discussion do the players talk about possibility of of having their life thrown into upheaval absolutely hangs in the air over the entire team and I was on a number of teams where guys were traded at the deadline you knew it was coming and it affects your team for that entire period leading up to it and obviously there's a massive adjustment period after when a star player changes teams but there's no doubt about it everybody's aware it could happen and until it does and is finalized you're kind of hanging in the balance waiting to see what the new version is going to be some great defense from OKC that last one Hartenstein couldn't get it control Richards with the rebound there's still rumors out there was a lot of rumor that Kevin Durant could be traded Bradley Beal could be traded and until that deadline comes and goes they're always thinking about it Richards floats it up and in Richards in the nine games he's played so far averaging nine points 10 and 1 12 boards Dort to Hartenstein he has perfected that Lefty floater it's like he's releasing doves into the air the way he lets go of that thing and they they they typically end up very peacefully at the bottom of the net as well for a big tough guy it's such a soft touch that he has around the basket speaking of soft touches Booker with his second field goal Gilgeous Alexander again gets inside gets off the shot but Richards knocks him down first foul on Richards more free throws for Shai Gilgeous Alexander I can't emphasize enough how difficult this shot is it to shoot these shots at the front of the rim from that distance with that kind of Arc it just requires a level of precision and obviously a ton of repetition I mean that that's where you get the muscle memory it's just unique You Don't See big guys in the league take that shot and Hartenstein you know takes that you know five six eight 10 times some nights in a game and and they knew he was going to be a huge piece to their Championship hopes but especially with Chad HR who sitting next to him there just playing 10 games after having that hip injury and hram getting closer and closer but Hartenstein's impact so much bigger than they even thought has he ever delivered I mean he had he got so much hype from what he did in New York and then entering the market wondering where he was going to end up he has more than lived up to every dollar he got from the OKC Thunder buman Shang coming into the game for OKC and Bradley Beal just checking in his first shot perfect and Phoenix back up by one you're only moving the ball that's what you have to do you're not going to beat this team consistently off the dribble it has to move through the air Phoenix has done a great job of that to this point and J called for a ping clearly bomb that one first turnover you see here you start in the Middle with a ball screen ball goes left wing right slot right corner quickly within a matter of 3 seconds four different people touch the ball against a team that loads up on the paint the way Oklahoma City does we've even seen begno throwing in a little bit of Zone here in this first quarter now Dort on Beal Beal nice move inside and squeaks it in Phoenix back up by three suns are shooting 10 of 15 from the field again against the best defense in the leag the other Jalen Williams his first shot of the night misses Mason Plumlee with the rebound so Plumlee Booker Beal and Booker goes right at Jen and they say before the upward motion that looked like it was in the act of shooting but they'll take it on a side out Booker thinks so like Bo think so I think so I I don't know maybe I'm not sure what a promotion is sometimes contact yeah one more step but I mean he's getting into that shot that is very very close and the way that they now legislate this particular call really could go either way from our first angle absolutely looked like he earned a couple of free throws Ryan dun has checked in for Phoenix Alex Caruso and Joe in for the Thunder beel looking for some of to throw to Booker fortunately it was there for him Allen the extra pass be very aggressive Off the Bench three for three seven points in three minutes there's Joe Joe whips a pass Jen nails that three again next man up so to speak Monday against the Bucks that was a blowout game but he had season High 21 points season High eight rebounds season high five assists as Booker draws a foul and comes up hobbling a little bit looks like he could have possibly bang knees on that or caught a knee to that area just above his knee and that's where he's grabbing but he he did earn the two free throws but he paid a price for it already without Kevin Durant the sprained ankle yeah look as he as he collided with Caruso on the initial move you saw the Grimace hooker six early points it's right there when he first swings through and tries to get that step on him you saw his right knee absorb the contact from Caruso slide in over Booker one for two buildas Alexander goes right at D the rookie thought he got fouled backs at home he's got 11 points already hooker guarded by Caruso the other new Big Time acquisition in the off season dun rushed it comes up short ball knocked out of bounds Thunderball and this is why he's so difficult you know these these spaces and these gaps to a lot of people handling the ball don't look big enough to take that on but Shai Gilgeous Alexander loves that likes actually creating that contact didn't get the call on that one but could have been a three-point play Gilgeous Alexander pulls back jum is good and you look at his strength I've been hearing this since I was a kid talk about a guy who's wiry strong functional strength without that without a doubt he has it another one there operating in that favorite spot you know 15 to 18 ft pull up there's Caruso such a good defensive player harassing Booker Plumlee difficult pass but Finds Its way to Jones Jones just gets it off in time but an air ball so a 24 second violation great defensive sequence there for the Thunder yeah this is I believe the best mid-range game player we have in the league right now he's Herky jerky and then he always creates that little bit of Separation by dipping that shoulder into your chest and then he separates backwards lean back got good height to get that extension and pullup shot Durant's a candidate for that as well Williams off to Jen Jen goes right at Booker floats it up shots good though keeps his aggressiveness from that blowout the other night right here tonight in their first quarter some important minutes boy Caruso with some excellent defense there you know you look at Devin Booker's numbers career obviously he's a great player great scorer but his career three-point shooting numbers only about 35% with a guy with a stroke like that I think that's part of the reason he takes a lot of difficult threes Jalen Williams misses dun grabs the rebound under two minutes to go here with the first it's been a pretty good Pace in this one thus far both teams shooting a high percentage Plumlee to Beal Booker Off the bouns Strip Caruso Joel picks it up boy Caruso already a huge impact five turnovers Jen goes inside can't get it to go plumly the rebound Booker wanting to post up against Joe there's a double dun good clean look Plumlee the weak side rebound and Dunn cuts and scores rarely see OKC get caught unaware on the weak side the offensive rebound put them in chaos mode Brian done great job reading that with the cut from the opposite corner Gilgeous Alexander misses the three ball batted around Booker did a good job tipping it away and Plumlee will hand off Bradley Beal goes right that Joe jump shot it's good Bradley Field Four for four Off the Bench yeah this is a guy that averaged 30 plus points a game in back-to-back Seasons exactly so and he he went to the bench accepted it mik gooder said been the ultimate Pro and he is coming in cooking he's got the green light as soon as he touches it and he's got it going so far this one gilas Alexander trying to draw a foul can't get it to go but right there on the follow is Caruso Caruso's dealt with a a bunch of injuries in his first year here in OKC but when healthy he is an Absolute Pest defensively with so many different things to impact winning field Corner three won't go goodless Alexander will slow it down Phoenix has a foul to give shot clock turned off up top to Joe long three-pointer at the buzzer Nails the three a 37-point first quarter for OKC as they shoot 54% from the field used every second on the clock Gilgeous Alexander with the pass Suns hanging a cuff though mobile here with Royce O'Neal the sun six points for you down four though what are the positives of the first quarter uh I think we moving the ball well uh getting some stops we just got to you know on the defense end get more rebound downs and you know the loose balls Shai is so slithery out there weaving through traffic how do you try to limit his Effectiveness uh just make things tough for him throw different looks at him uh I mean try to take away you know the spots that he want to get to and then make every shot for him contested Roy good luck thank you appreciate all right guys back to you Mike all right George uh nine assists for Phoenix in that first quarter they shot 59% as Beal pulls up can't get that to go kendri Williams out there with Jalen Williams Caruso hartenstein inside hartenstein floats it up that won't go rebound Grayson Allen it's Allen Beal Plumlee Dunn and Jones Grayson Allen goes inside back up top seven on the 24 good defense from Williams shuts off Allen forces a double team and the help from Hartenstein and that is OKC defense in a nutshell right there tremendous job by Kendrick Williams cutting off that penetration by Grayson Allen and it's just such a commitment across their roster to keep the ball in front of you but if you do get beat you're not going to get hung out to drrive with the help Plumlee tried a fancy spin move lost it backto back turnovers Joe to Caruso nice fake by Caruso keeps that dribble alive throws it off the chest of Hartenstein that's only the second Thunder turnover Grayson Allen walks up into with three the third Williams here on the Thunder roster Williams another just a good solid veteran doesn't play huge minutes dangerous pass but Harin able to get it Jalen Williams too strong Hartenstein keeps it alive goes all the way in the back court Williams kicks it out Caruso wide open Plumlee battling Joe comes out of the pack another offensive rebound that was a key Point as Gro misses that for Mike buos before the game it's been a major problem for them typically when they have their smaller lineup on the floor with Kevin Durant out there as the five but even here with Plumlee giving up some offensive glass it it actually cost them a game the other night in Portland inability to secure a defensive rebound late in that game a couple of times be will go to the line and just the offensive boards Joe grabbing that you know we also talked Mike pu the first thing he said was turnovers now 97.8% of the head coaches you talked to before game will tell you not turn the ball over that's the key to every every single NBA game that's ever played but against this team it's doubly important I'm not even playing in the league anymore and every morning when I brush my teeth I look in the mirror and say don't turn the ball over it's it's that's how much you you can't afford to do it in any night really but particularly against teams that can convert it as quickly as Oklahoma City can your defense just cannot recover in time when you lose an opportunity to get something up on the glass and give yourself a chance Oklahoma City's just too fast up the Flor Crest or Colgate uh typically Crest but now the choices overwhelm me there's too many I stand there for 5 minutes in the aisle staring at the different boxes there really are a lot of different variables of Crest Jones knocks it down if you had toothpaste choices for tonight's game you win Joe goes inside three minutes gone by here in the second Joe good looking jumper there he's got five points Off the Bench you talk about hot he is averaging just under 15 in his last 10 games and 56% from the three in the last five games yeah Royce O'Neal barely touched it before he got into the shooting motion and O'Neal off to a nice start couple of three-pointers and Phoenix back up by two timeout OKC gear up for NBA Allstar shop nbastore.com now for the best selection of NBA All-Star gear choose from t-shirts hats and more nbastore.com a Fanatics experience now you look at the Western Conference standings OKC up top but look at Phoenix they're basically tied for eighth in the west only two games back in the loss column of sixth they're also only percentage points ahead of the 11th spot it's so crazy and that's why these deals could could make such a difference in terms of everybody so close you add an extra player and boy it can make a difference in the team as Williams misses top of the backboard in bounds Beal pulls up and knocks one down by the way again we we said this or we talked about this earlier when Kevin Durant and Devin Booker have been on the court together this year they're 23 and 11 that's a 67% winning percentage basically and I think 67% total since they've been paired together which if you look at the rate that teams are winning this season Mike you don't think about where that puts them in the standings they can just keep them on the court together Jones nice move inside Tas Jones eight points couple of assists course starting now with be coming off the bench Royce O'Neal guarding Jalen Williams Williams in the paint soft touch so Phoenix continues to shoot lights out 61% from the field get a team with the number one defense number one in opponent's field goal percentage and a whole host of other categories shot clock at five Beal Jones in a paint turn scores Beal and Jones working nicely together and Phoenix to this point just not feeling the pressure that Oklahoma City typically makes you feel out on the perimeter they're comfortable in their handle in their ball movements and certainly in their shooting Williams thought to get fouled Suns come the other way 5 minutes gone by here in the second Phoenix trying to snop a two- game losing streak pass inside to Nick Richards they will reset the two losses were both in Portland and early in the season you think oh those are bad losses Portland's playing great now O'Neal lines it up that's good Royce O'Neal four four for four from three-point range and the Suns have their largest lead of the first half a nine-point Advantage they're eight of 16 from three legs Phoenix carving them up getting into a comfort zone nine-point lead well this is the number one defensive team in the league and you wouldn't know it by the way the suns are operating right now Bradley Beal getting some work done with Devin Booker on the bench first with his mid-range game and then drawing multiple Defenders and making the right play layup or Easy Shot for Jones and then a kick out opposite corner to Royce O'Neal just to show you opponents of the Thunder this year have shot 50% from the field that's a beautiful move from Wiggins have shot 50% from the field five times in 48 games five times that's it right now Phoenix shooting 63% obviously still long ways to go as Jones turns it over that's rare Jones has been the leader and assist turnover ratio six consecutive fears O'Neal getting the start tonight and he is paid dividends 12 points three boards seven-point Phoenix lead fairly quiet start for Booker but when you've got three other guys in double figures already you can withstand that Jones side to Richards Richards has it knocked Away by Lu Dort GilgeousAlexander the hesitation now gets inside perfect change of pace and it's back to a five-point game yeah you've got to have full commitment you have to have minimum of four guys get out ahead of the basketball against OKC because of Shai Gilgeous Alexander's ability to get in small gaps and seams Jones misses a three Richards the offensive rebound Beal jump shot it's good Bradley Beal six of eight from the field now he this year he's either the fourth or fifth highest paid player in the league and has been asked to come off the bench and as you said he's embraced it but he's not happy he'd rather start no doubt that's a tough thing for any player that's had the success he has in this league to accept but he's done a great job of it his production has been almost identical to when he was a starter and their winning percentage has been identical they're basically a 500 team either way and he averages 17 a game either way mik buos says he's been incredibly professional through it all Royce O'Neal's been incredibly accurate he's now five for five from three-point range it's the only five shots he's taken 15 points and 13 minutes crowd kind of quiet this one of the Ludest crowds in the NBA but the Suns with a magnificent offensive performance so far here in in the first half nice pass inside Booker shot won't go but a foul Wiggins commits the personal O'Neal with an excellent pass yeah it's a difficult pass to make too Devin Booker does a nice job uses some leverage down there to seal and hold off and you can see Wiggins just turned his head slightly perfect timing on that delivery from O'Neal today Booker to set up these two free throws so Booker knocks down the first tonight's National TV schedule brought to you by ESPN bet official sports book of ESPN TNT tomorrow Maverick Celtics from Boston Warriors and Lakers new teams for three of those four ESPN Saturday Lakers host the Pacers again that might be Luca Don's Laker debut then ABC Saturday night Celtics and the Knicks and that's the interesting thing especially for the Western coaches you look like it Dallas in La all of a sudden the way you've scattered the teams the way they play has changed significantly completely changed right now what the landscape could look like and it's going to be fascinating to watch both of those teams as Joe again continues his heater over the last month to watch each of those teams LA and Dallas and and this new iteration of what they are going to look like acquiring these star players everybody will be fascinated to watch it Evol O'Neal Bei against Gilgeous Alexander gets inside good help defense Wiggins now on O'Neal Grayson Allen catch shoot comes up short and Ne to Jalen Williams with a rebound nine-point Phoenix lead they've led by as many as 12 Gilgeous Alexander back up top Phoenix competing defensively Williams left open does not want to shoot that two-pointer wiggin's going to have to a contested three gets it off can't get it the go but Jalen Williams tips it another offensive rebound for the Thunder killer to have a great defensive possession collectively and allow a long rebound to give a team this good another shot at it and Gilgeous Alexander lost it that's nine offensive rebounds and Mark digel is going to challenge that out of bounds call now that could result in turning on the out of bounds or perhaps a foul let's take a look he thought he got hit that's their hope O'Neal appears to hit Gilgeous Alexander on that left arm Gilgeous Alexander did touch it last and there's the swipe hard to tell on that particular angle but clearly off the fingertips the key is will they call that a vow so the OKC Thunder challenging it they will get two free throws out of this I believe and here's Pat FR review O'Neal hits the arm of Alexander after he started his shooting motion therefore this is approximate foul this is going to be a successful challenge play will resume with two free throws for OKC OK OKC retains the right to challenge and again that was from the playoffs a couple of years ago on a key out- of bounds play at the end of a playoff game where they got the out of bounds right but the only reason that the player lost that out of bounds is because it got hacked that was in Dallas and I think that's that's a good adjustment to that rule much needed rule changeed because what was happening we we all see a replay and it would be a situation are you going to believe me or you're lying eyes a lot of times now they've gotten that corrected for this exact reason what what you just saw that's why they want to make sure this kind of thing happens it used to be just look at who hit it last but now you can actually get in there and see if there was contact that led to Shai Gilgeous Alexander losing control of the ball in the first place he's got 16 points leading the NBA in scoring 32 and A2 points per game that would be the most ever for franchise if he held that Kevin Durant wants average 32 a game when he played here Russell Westbrook averaged 31.6 per game no Durant tonight spring tle Beal to Allen Corner three that's good they're now 10 of 20 from three and this is really Bradley Beal right now setting the table and showing you how talented he is as an offensive player even against this great defense repeatedly breaking them down Gilgeous Alexander Baseline chumper 19 for Shai Gilgeous Alexander meanwhile Off the Bench 15 points four assists three rebounds Grayson Allen that one off the mark Joe catches ahead to Wiggins B good defense initial trying to fight over a screen Gilgeous Alexander in gets in the paint in and contact that time he just found the contact that was nice poised play for Gilgeous Alexander two free throws yeah this is tough because of of Shai Gilgeous Alexander's talent but I don't particularly like Drop coverage against him because when he comes off the ball screen and that Center is 56 ft back you're basically now giving him space in the exact area of the floor that he want wants to shoot the ball Plumlee comes up there's the L for I mean it's less two evils and I'm making something complicated sounds simple but I just think when Shai Gilgeous Alexander comes off and he sees that amount of space uh between where he is and that backline Defender it's his mind starts working in ways that he can get a guy off balance and get into that pullup 21-point first half for Gilgeous Alexander but it's the Suns with a six-point lead minute and a half to go and a foul on Gilgeous Alexander that's his first so first B the last two minutes side Out Boy Mike woser has to be thrilled with the offensive execution here in this first half Phoenix just looks Sensational and they're doing it without Kevin Durant boy Plumlee upset he felt that Hartenstein pushed and he certainly looked that way definitely contact here as plumy runs this ball down Hartenstein gets up into him you see the left hand on the hip and you know Plumlee's already sort of up on his toes so he's not in a great balanced position it doesn't take much to knock someone into the back court which is exactly what hartenstein did L Dort comes up short hartenstein had it knocked out of his hands by Plumlee Dort guarding Booker Booker gets inside beautiful move from Devin Booker and he's in double figures with 10 the lead back up to eight and again we see one side of the floor with somebody getting beat off the dribble and all the way to the rim before there's a rotation along the Baseline very rare for Oklahoma City Shai Gilgeous Alexander pulls up 23 here in the first half now seven of 14 from the field all eight of his free throws have been good Booker and O'Neal took his eye off it yeah and actually I think Plumlee cut at exactly the time that Booker was throwing the ball to O'Neal and I think it it just distracted O'Neal for just a split second he couldn't quite see the basketball until it was too late if you said the suns were going to have 11 turnovers that's Gilgeous Alexander Nails another three 26 first half points and the lead is cut to three but still if you said Phoenix had 11 turnovers and there were going to be ahead crowds been kind of quiet that's because of the Phoenix Suns offensive execution about a 5-sec differ shot clock game clock and a foul on Joe and that's going to put Booker on the line they're in the penalty crowd doesn't like the call yeah and Shai's done a better job of this this year where he senses maybe what it's going to take out out of him as a scorer on nights when you see a team being able to execute against them and right now he is absolutely cooking nobody is going to be happier to see halftime than Mike buer right now because it will interrupt this Rhythm that Shai Gilgeous Alexander is in meanwhile the Suns have been Rhythm the entire first half we've got our halftime presented by Hyundai coming up and of course the big story tonight Jimmy Butler to the Warriors Malika chenet Wendy he now gets Wendy as as opposed he's known as Wendy now that's a universal nickname and of course Udonis Haslam great to hear his contributions what a great role player he was for so many years for the Miami Heat NBA champion Gilgeous Alexander goes right at Plumlee gets inside L it's good he's Unstoppable right now 28 points final seconds no fouls to give O'Neal gets it off in time and that will end the first half Phoenix plays a terrific first two quarters 60% from the field 103 pointers but Shai Gilgeous Alexander with 28 first half points and we go to halftime two-point game here in Oklahoma City 6361 Sun's up two 28 points as we welcome you back back NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm but it's Phoenix with a two-point lead 6361 our first half stats brought to you by Ford Gilgeous Alexander was just Unstoppable 28 points got to the free throw line eight times but bradle Beal Off the Bench with no Kevin Durant and Devin B Booker initially struggling Beal was Sensational the entire Phoenix Suns team was Sensational offsetting what was just a spectacular first half for Shai Gilgeous Alexander they did a reasonable job containing Shai Gilgeous Alexander at the start of the game was four for 11 at the start but then he became very unreasonable towards the Suns in getting to his areas and I've talked about it a lot this is where he wants to operate very unique most ISO players in this league prefer the wings or off the off the block on either side but this is where Shai cooks and he got going late made his last five field goals first to three then the patented mid-range 15-footer and then that quick acceleration down the lane to the rim before the Suns can react so for Phoenix and you just look at that those numbers once again he's you know one of the key contenders for MVP but for Phoenix in the first half what do they do offensively that teams have not been able to do this on a regular bases to this OKC defense they stayed away from Baseline drives Baseline drives against OKC are where possessions go to die and they haven't done a lot of that they've kept the ball on the wings and above and that's where you can operate much better against OKC with ball movement and right away they've tied the game largest lead for the Suns was 12 again they shot so well over 60% from the field in that first half Booker guarded by D Booker turns into with double team gets it down to Richards Richard right back out and we send it over turnover send it over to George Sedano Mike Tim you nailed it when I spoke to Mark dagnal the head coach of OKC he talked about their defense defending the perimeter and the three-point shot he gave the Suns a ton of credit for the way they were moving the ball and said specifically though it starts with their point of attack defense that he feels that needs to be shorted up thank you George meanwhile the lead is already gone Dort with the save well they've had this year Alexander can't hit that an arenstein call for a loose ball foul they've trailed the Thunder of trail by double figures in 16 of their 48 games so far this year so now 17 out of 49 in those games they're 10 and four which is the best record in the NBA in overcoming double figure deficits every metric you could think of Mike they're they're going to be great at it it's just that kind of year for them and their defense gets most of the credit but they're very efficient team offensively as well Booker got some space but should couldn't get the shot to go down Williams searching out to Dort Dort three-pointers good but a quick start here to this third period and just like that the Thunder up by five this is their largest lead Jones looking another turnover Here Comes Wiggins Jones tries to get in his way Wiggins throws it inside Alexander using that left hand up and in and the Suns need a timeout nine straight points in the first two minutes of the third and the deficit has suddenly turned into a seven-point lead we talked about turning up to pressure on the perimeter and that's exactly what OKC has done here coming out of the locker room and turning that defense into offense Suns time to regroup Pi will have a 4-Hour NBA Today trade deadline special all of the analysts insiders break down all the movement Zack LaVine dearon Fox donic Anthony Davis Jimmy Butler Chris Middleton Kyle kosma yonas valent Tunis the hits just keep on coming not just a busy trade deadline so far but the big names that could really make a difference for teams come playoff time Booker fights over screen d right on him O'Neal nice fake back to Booker jump shot can't get it the fall Richards battling but the thunder come away what a dominant start here in the first two and a half minutes for OKC seven possessions now for the Suns out of the locker room without a point including three turnovers Alexander tied up and a 3se second violation this is what happens to opponents all the time you think you're hanging tough you're right with them you're right with him and all of a sudden a 4minute span and and you're in big trouble and it's just obvious visually how much faster Oklahoma City is moving defensively the desperation has picked up you're seeing white jersey flooding to the ball lot of activity with their hands it's just a different level right now that they've taken it to Booker is Booker is frustrated that's the second time he thought he was in the act of shooting on a foul instead they call it prior to the upward motion Mike buhos are looking up at the big screen so a side out the foul against Dart his first Jones can't get it the fall the three-point shooting was huge difference in that first half Phoenix good Oklahoma City struggled but they're not struggling now on any part of the court and the lead is ballooned to nine 11 straight points Phoenix has yet to score here in the third you know that one was a quick hitter so it was tough to really run an extra guy at Shai but at some point they're going to have to consider just making sure they get a second body force him to give the basketball up because he is just absolutely owning the middle of the floor and getting wherever he wants right now controlling the game he's got 32 of their 72 points Williams hesitation now gets inside turn shoots and scores the onslaught continues an 11-point lead now Williams right up into Booker a first time allar here is not a lot of room to move right now offensively for Phoenix Grayson Allen off the bound shot blocked by Gilgeous Alexander he averages a block per game to go with his two steals per game in addition to all the scoring yeah he does it every way imaginable he's got great length and he this is something he's become very Adept at is tracking ball handlers from behind using his length his time to disrupt shots you know Mike you see these little nuggets about guys all the time in the research that we get I love this one second player in the history of the game to average 30 on 50% shooting with five boards five assist two Steals and one block the other guys named Michael Jordan did it twice and both of those were MVP Seasons lovely company he keeps Gilgeous Alexander can't get that one to go rebound Wiggins Jalen Williams in and out and Allen the rebound it's now over four minutes Phoenix has yet to score here in the third Booker gets whacked and he'll shoot two free throws chance for Phoenix to finally get on the board here in the third and you see Mike pu hols are get going to Bradley Beal earlier than he normally would have he walked up to the table with eight and a half minutes to go in the third he was their best player in the first half he was able to do things against OKC's defense uh and he didn't start him which he hasn't been but in three and a half minutes you go from a two-point lead to down 13 while he's on the bench so Bo noer got him in there pretty quickly oh Booker trying another and gets it to go Booker became the son's all-time leading scorer on Monday passing the late great Walter Davis and Booker's you know saying it means so much to him in his entire career with the Phoenix Suns an extraordinary accomplishment in such a short amount of time G is Alexander Banks it in and the foul but they're going to wave off the bucket no side out I wonder because this happens sometimes we've seen a bunch of these tonight is that like something the officials have talked about recently and that they have to they do a better job of whether or not it's in the act of shooting they are this one to me is a little bit more obvious because the initial contact happened a whole dribble before Shai Gilgeous Alexander got into his shooting motion I thought the two on Booker were more Pro to getting fre throws it doesn't matter he gets the ball back and he knocks down another 34 points six rebounds three assists and a block shot Bradley Beal the floer everything B did turn to gold for Phoenix Allen good job deflecting gets it back from Richards Grayson Allen can't hit the three Richards pushed off oh loose ball foul on Richards for his second yeah it's just he puts it on auto dial Shai Gilgeous Alexander when he gets rolling and he did the way he closed the half came out tried to stay hot by staying aggressive and making sure this Rhythm continues and again occupying and dominating that area 12 to 18 ft Booker trying to put some pressure on Wiggins runs right into Gilgeous Alexander against Jones back out Wiggins lines up three-pointer Bater everything going down right now for the Thunder pick your poison and that time they did run an extra body at Shai and he got the ball to the shooter and Wiggins made Phoenix pay oh Giles Alexander goes up and throws it down Shai Gilgeous Alexander putting on a show and the lead now 81-65 he's got 36 points in 24 minutes Shai Gilgeous Alexander showing you the whole package OKC on a 20 to2 run out of The Locker Room Phoenix bringing the ball up look at the domination here in this third quarter 20-2 suns have no field goals five turnovers Bradley Beal gets up and under and finally get a field goal and it took them almost six minutes with this swarming smothering OKC defense to say they turned it up a notch legs is an understatement yeah they took this challenge personally you know they were challenged by Mark dagnal at halftime to represent what they've been all year defensively you're seeing it right here nice pass honstein Wiggins a little fake and the lead back up to 16 there's Bradley beel had that hot first first half B shot won't go but he got hit so 5 and a half remaining in the third free throws from him and let's here from Shai Gilgeous Alexander wearing a mic Force tonight yo let's get stopped and let's play Confident our offense come on here we play Confident on offense come on move keep shooting baby be aggressive be aggressive dunk everything care the more I miss the more I shoot I get frustated I get competitive with myself wo a virtuoso performance what I love about that here he's having this spectacular game and L Dort who's one for four from three he's telling L dor keep shooting and that's what Mark dagnal was referring to talking about his improved leadership you more vocal with the guy senses the the responsibility of greatness and Leadership it's on full display here and once again Oklahoma City getting that ball to the middle of the floor and just then attacking from a cutter along the Baseline Phoenix having a very difficult time right now containing this action there there's so much to love about the special talent the leadership the fact that he's as hard of worker and he always talks about what he can do better but the way he puts his teammates first he's a super Superstar and he carries himself like one of the guys here what I can't say enough what it means to a team to run out of the tunnel every night knowing that they've got a guy who a lot of nights is going to be the best player on the floor it it just owers the entire roster the consistency and the efficiency night in and night out field goes back door oh shot blocked by Dort blue Dort with a spectacular defens a play Gilgeous Alexander drives layup count it the Shai Gilgeous Alexander Avalanche continues Beal gets away goes up inside and foul by Dort and free throws for Beal serious end to end there Bradley Beal with a beautiful back cut on this first play L Dort comes across the lane to meet him at The Rim great job on the back cut once you get the overplay and there's d That's all ball Bradley beill wanted a call I think that's a clean block and then this is this is what we always talk about with this team anything they clean up off the glass and the ball's going to be Outlet it and it's going to be basically in the scoring area within a matter of a dribble or two beeld 19 points and 21 minutes off the bench but his team now down 18 upcoming National TV schedule double header tomorrow on TNT Celtics host the Mavericks Warriors and the Lakers from La ESPN Saturday Pacers and Lakers Luca donic that's right now they hope that's going to be his Laker debut then ABC Saturday night in New York Nick's hosting the Celtics a lot of big games and so games that take on a complete different feeling about them with all these new players Anthony Davis expected to play shortly for the Dallas Mavericks 16-point game Gilgeous Alexander gets inside gets the shot off and draws a foul he's already eight for eight from the line deal picks up his second personal you know when you when you talk to Gilgeous Alexander when he was a freshman in high school he was only 55 and look at these numbers in terms of highest percentage of free throws made only Harden and Jordan but he he talks about he he said he grew up he was clumsy he was all arms and he's never been the fastest player he doesn't have lightning speed he's just so crafty the change of pace the change of Direction and hearing the MVP chance he was a finalist last year he is a leading candidate to say the least this year long way to go and then of course jic has been equally superb but this could be the year for S Gilgeous Alexander bucker nice move gets inside tripped up thunder wanted to travel but Booker looked like he got tripped he'll take free throws as Shai Gilgeous Alexander picks up his third Deon Booker has to be laughing to himself because he had two plays earlier when he basically's driving into a pull-up shot with contact doesn't get a call and in this one he's falling to the ground definitely contact there in a reach but he just throws this ball toward the ceiling and this one earns him two free right well heads up play that time Booker now at 14 he's been to the line 10 times same as Gilgeous Alexander love the point the graphic we put up about Shai last time he was at the line they're 29th in the league Oklahoma City in free throw attempts 29th and yet you've got this guy that's the best in the league at it so he's not getting a whole lot of help from the line speaks again volumes to how efficient this team is overall but they're number one in percentage because he shoots 90% gets inside creates some space Lu Dort who he told him to keep shooting the rebound goes to Royce O'Neal Booker spins against Wiggins sun's trying to cut into this lead now here after this disastrous start to the third Beal off the bounce poked Away by Dort here's Jalen Williams Williams Wiggins layup missed it but a foul as O'Neal picks up his second and Wiggins to shoot two one thing about OKC it's you know you can have guys on your team that do a great job laterally containing the ball that's one thing they they have a unique element to their defense where they can slide laterally while being active with their hands and they've got four or five guys that can do it so even when you do get semi beat their activity level with their hands can still reach in and affect the play and force the ter you saw it right there by L Dort looked like Bradley be had a lane to the rim and Lor doesn't give up pokes it from behind and it still ends up with two free throws going the other way they not only have great team defense but but the individual Defenders and Dort and I I'll say this every game that a broadcast of Dort Dort deserves to be NBA all defense he has that kind of impact on this team every night always guards the toughest opponent and he plays a physical Style with quickness shoulders are always squared up to the ball handler so he absorbs a lot of that contact with his chest he's strong and he has a nice low base and he makes sure that the ball stays between his shoulders very difficult to get around him if you do he just has a relentlessness where he doesn't give up on the play lead up to 18 Beal gets in the paint comes up short but a foul it's going to go against Caruso that's two on Alex Caruso speaking of all NBA defense made the second team last year with the Chicago Bulls it's a smart play by Bradley Bal right here he's got Caruso on his back and he knows if you just stop and go vertical it's going to be very difficult for Caruso to stop in time doesn't take much contact to get that call but it was the right one Feld now at 22 Ryan Dunn will come in Grayson Allen who started tonight again no Kevin Durant with ankle spraining from the other night against Portland Duran of course his first nine years here OKC one an MVP here took him to the finals Dort goes inside ball poked away Caruso right there good defense from Phoenix Caruso fakes the pass can't hit the three Dort the rebound Alexander pull up jump shot got got it 42 points in 27 minutes and he's so tough because most players in this league prefer One Direction or the other for the pullup doesn't matter to Shai Booker good move but couldn't finish here comes Dort Dort the spin move back up top Jalen Williams nobody near him and Plumlee tracks it down as we're under three minutes remaining here in the third dun left open daring the rookie to shoot Williams with a rebound that's going to be the challenge for dun he's a great defender has the potential to be one of those all League caliber type Defenders he's got to be a better and more consistent three-point shooter Williams left wide open again comes up short gets the rebound he's not going to do it again Caruso though will can't hit that Devin Booker looking for Plumlee Royce O'Neal was hot in the first half can't get it going he was five for five from three-point range in the first half 0 for three here in the second as we're under the two-minute Mark beautiful feed Williams can't get it plumly the rebound but a foul and Jalen Williams will shoot slow it up it seems to be okay and now they are extending Phoenix a little bit certainly more than they were in the first half on Shai on ball screens with penetration they're meeting him with a second Defender out above the top of the key but he is capable of beating you with the pass and that was a beautiful pocket pass to Williams diving to the rim Mike boosa Will challenge that last call Sun's down 18 when they led by two at halftime what a third quarter for OKC here on on Bradley Beal it doesn't look like he hits him in the head there Tim he doesn't there's a little bit of contact with Bradley Beal's chest on his right shoulder and this angle doesn't show it as well as the last one that last angle showed it better there's a little contact from Beal's chest to his right shoulder right there he caught him just a little bit I don't think he touched him on his head and I don't think he kicked him either this is the one I was talking about right there his hip really actually more or so then his shoulder got into Bradley Beal's body a little bit so there was some contact if he goes straight up he's fine the officials like to talk about if he goes from A to B then that would constitute a foul they made a decision our officials tonight Pat fry the crew chief Eric dalan Su Meta Meta number 82 with his back to us Doan on the left for on the right eight 18-point lead for the Thunder they Trail by 12 in the first half here's FR P Pawn review be drifts slightly forward and makes hip-to-hip contact so this is going to stand as a defensive foul challenge is unsuccessful player will resume with two free throws for Williams that hip you spoke of yeah well well spotting hip tohp contact and you see it right there and Bradley Beal was coming for forward at the time he wasn't in a straight vertical position and so free throw stand so the other jayen Williams able to connect on the first that's his first points he has six rebounds missed early on in the season first 27 games with a hamstring but he's a big part of the team so many of their role players on any given night the impact that they can have coming off the bench or an occasional start it is such a deep team and right now they've got their largest lead a 20-point Advantage foul called on on Dort anticipated this well knowing that this ball was going to be thrown to the outside hand you he just released gets to that side of his body he had his hand around his waist right there he pulls his left arm back at the same time he's reaching around you know if that's if that's a defensive back in football right that's the one they always catch you on when you turn the body a little bit before you make the play on the ball with your opposite hand he's not buying he's not buying the interpretation it's his third foul and Booker now with 16 points the Thunder this year still have a quarter to go with the Thunder this year of their 39 victories 31 of them by double figures they don't just win they dominate Alexander draws the foul before the upward motion and Ryan Dunn picks up the personal duns first to your point this is how dominant they've been defensiv we talk about defensive rating all the time and you start to look at the rankings of teams and these numbers are tight right these teams are Bunch together Oklahoma City's margin over the number two defensive rated team that Gap is the same Gap that exists between team two and team 11 that's how dominant Oklahoma City has been over the rest of the field their point differential is 12.6 coming into tonight that's on Pace to be the largest in NBA history and long way to go first Miss from the line ball last touched by Plumlee so they get another position posession Gilgeous Alexander has 43 now he's scored 50 points or more twice this season the season high is 54 question whether he gets 50 in this game is a direct correlation to any type of run the Suns might have right keep him on the floor here's Booker racing up the floor he thought he got fouled again L dor goes strong and finishes just an overwhelming performance here in this third quarter for OKC now up by 21 as we approach a minute remaining hooker stops and foul thuso picks up the personal Phoenix has just 14 points just great positionally Oklahoma City I Deon Booker would like to get a call because there's contact but the defender squared him up perfectly and that's what Oklahoma City does across the board join ASN and the NBA family to support all those affected by the California wildfire fires in 2025 donate at redcross.org ESPN to help the Red Cross respond and help people recover it will be a long long recovery Phoenix shot 60% in the first half they're 1 for 12 here in the third quarter Caruso just adds to the domination 10179 final minute here in the third Ryan dun with seven on the shot clock done off the bounce inside Plumlee blocked by Caruso last Touch by Dunn another fantastic defensive play and this is Shai Gilgeous Alexander initially you know MVP candidate up 22 43-point night out there pressuring dun the way that he was forcing him into the traffic and then the backside help with the block Gilgeous Alexander with a three-pointer 46 points another Masterpiece from Shai Gilgeous Alexander tonight 10479 shot clock and game clock about 4 and 1/2 seconds difference and Plumlee a hard screen on door just shakes his head and the Suns can hold it for the final shot yeah this is just his timing on this is so quick off the ground Dunn is right there in his space it's almost hand onand contest but it's just doesn't affect Shai Gilgeous Alexander because he knows exactly when he wants to release that basketball one more possession here in the third Gilgeous Alexander feeling it drives inside pulls up shot won't go a rare miss here in the third quarter an absolute bludgeoning here in this third period OKC outscores Phoenix 436 wherever your brain at just do it yeah yeah you know what I'm saying trust your instincts don't shoot it off the backboard trust your instincts good next one good yeah next one good how many threes you missed like six me too I just made a couple that's all if you shoot eight some of them will go in I love that thinking that's always been my philosophy Mike I know that when I played eventually they're going to go field tripped up he outscored the entire Suns team in that third quarter he had 18 in the third the Suns had 16 but he also got it done defensively as the entire team just that smothering defense there are sometimes when you watch the Thunder defense like that third quarter you almost feel they have six guys on the floor you really do it's almost like you get empathy for the offense there there's just nothing to be had the biggest difference from what you saw in the start of this game to the third quarter white jerseys further out on the floor extending out pushing Phoenix out on the floor offensively and markk D's going to challenge that call Beal was expected to go to the free throw line we'll see how that works out as we open up the fourth quarter here in OKC the NBA on ESPN is presented all season long by State Farm like a good neighbor State Farm is there how are you Scott fan P here in the nation's capital we're getting set for Sports Center we'll have the details on the Jimmy Butler move to the Warriors what's that mean for the future of Kevin Durant with Phoenix sham Shir Brian windhorse with thoughts on that busy and entertaining night in the NBA all those highlights in the way Mahomes and herdz down there in New Orleans ahead of the Super Bowl coming up Sunday Mike timus the Shai Gilgeous Alexander show but what else is new it's been that way all year long hadn't it oh it certainly has and he's special again tonight they left him in the game with a 25-point lead to start the quarter you maybe a couple of buckets they thinking get him his 0 and and and get him out because I think he's on the floor for the entire third we have watch this year the emergence of a special Superstar he has been spectacular we get to watch Shai Gilgeous Alexander now we'll watch SVP later both special equally great in their own right hartenstein Alexander still out there goes inside shot Block M Richards nope they call a foul and arenstein says he's okay grabbed his knee and you heard like a little groan but then he quickly looked over to the bench and said I'm okay everybody's heart skip a beat right there with what they've dealt with Hartenstein out at the beginning of the year and then he comes back chat goes out and that's scary right there awkward fall grabs his knee fortunately he's okay he missed the first 15 games Hartenstein with that left hand injury then missed five more with the solo injury the back of the lower leg this is his fifth game back after missing five just again the number that that most shows what he does in the first 28 games he's played with the Thunder the Thunder's record is 255 and three look at this gets the rebound draws another foul on Richard just Relentless yeah he really captured everybody's attention with what he did for the Knicks last year particularly what he did in the postseason uh and he has come here and really delivered upon that potential and this is just a breakdown when you allow the shooter to walk in grab his own rebound and earn another trip back to the line Phoenix mentally right there just not with it it'll be interesting to see how Mark digel when Chad Holmgren returns how he plays both of them how often they'll play together I mean Holmgren in the 10 games he played was unbelievable before he got hurt after last year's terrific rookie season they say he is absolutely dying to play just all he wants to do is play basketball opening minute here in the fourth and what was a close fun game in the first half has turned into a route O'Neal finds his shooting touch again 18 points starting tonight had a big first half Jalen Williams can't get it to go and O'Neal fouled by Hartenstein that'll be his fourth foul to answer your question question about the Chet Holmgren Hartenstein parrying I'm not sure Mark dagal even knows at this point they just haven't really been able to experiment with it now ched hr's shooting ability will allow you to have proper spacing when he plays offensively but defensively that's a different challenge to have two bigs on the floor in a league that spreads you out and shoots as many threes as they do they have yet to play together because again Holmgren got hurt after 10 games and Hartenstein missed the first 15 O'Neal goes at Caruso leans in can't get it the fall Richards bats it off the shot clock so it's going to be OKC ball Mike legs it's interesting you mentioned that about the size because that clearly was an issue for them last season in that Series against Dallas where their bigs just kind of kept mauling them and pushing them around by the way a similar situation at NBA cup where Milwaukee kind of bullied them with their big as well legs it's been a factor for them it's the one thing you don't point to much with this team like it's nitpicking but they're protecting their own glass defensively and then occasionally three-point shooting can dry up but as I say that they make another three well Jalen Williams a quiet night for him the All-Star with 13 points now and yet another turnover Allen trying to knock it away from Williams Alexander a three fight for the rebound Hartenstein back to G jumper that's good 48 points trying to get 50 for the third time this season and a 28-point lead for the Thunder I have the feeling that's why he's out there right now legs I believe so as well and look this is just continuing this incredible run he's been on all season but particularly lately Mike coming into tonight 235 points in his last 205 minutes Allen trying to poke it away looks looking to double team him tiptoeing along now goes up pulls up jump shot there it is 50 points for Shai Gilgeous Alexander third time this season and a standing ovation here in Oklahoma City Richards on the slam impressive don't for Nick Richards Jalen Williams sneak inside nice feed and Joe BS at home the Shai treating these fans that's really what this is about you know you get to see a special performance at of Shai but Nick Richards just had maybe the most overlooked great dunk you're ever going to see because of the circumstances of the game and the performance by Shai Gilgeous Alexander Grayson Allen knocks down to three again Phoenix playing without Kevin Durant and for the first half they look they look terrific but just then that domination started another beautiful pass Joe another excellent cut this is a clinic and a timeout called by Mike puer and Gilgeous Alexander Knight I'm sure will come to an end 50 points seven rebounds five assists he's showing you all of it even when you run extra guys at him 5 has a nice ring to it and Shai does it once again Wednesday presented by Shai Gilgeous Alexander 3 50-point games in the last seven just one of the more incredible stretches we've seen as dam Lee misses that one and both coaches kind of empty their benches now with 8 minutes remaining Joe Jalen Williams Williams Jiang back in and Wiggins Wiggins to Williams back shot won't go fight for the rebound Williams gathers knocked out of his hands with a foul Jalen Bridges bow Bowl Colin Gillespie all have come on for the Phoenix Suns and throws for Williams this is this happens on a regular basis that you know the starters don't play a lot in the fourth quarter for OKC yeah this team is appropriately nicknamed right the Thunder the way they roll in I mean you you could feel it building and then it's just this eruption of Defense with a much faster Pace offensively and they put teams away the score in the second half is 6527 so rest for the starters their work is done led by just an unguardable player right now he is on a absolute tear Damen Lee up top daro Nadar looking for an opening Bridges couldn't handle it and and you watch often the the Thunder Wind they have gain like this you watch the starters on the bench and how happy and supportive they are for any success of the guys that don't get a chance to play as much there's a chemistry on this team you know you hear it all the time and when you're 39 and N the chemistry is going to be pretty darn good but this team legs seems to have just there's a camaraderie to it that you can see it with a naked eye it's just there's something special about how connected they are very rare to capture they've got incredible Trust of one another that the right play will be made for them when it's their turn and they've obviously got a connection through winning that that does bring a lot of this out but it's the you know chicken of the egg question I think first you have to establish this level of chemistry and then great things can happen on the court and they've really built something special here around a very special talent in Shai Gilgeous Alexander Gillespie gets in and draws the foul rova product will shoot some free throws Colin Gillespie good story here so I actually coached against Colin Gillespie when I was coaching in South Jersey he played for the Northeast sting in Philadelphia and you know going into his senior year didn't have a scholarship offer was hoping to maybe get one from Delaware ends up getting one from Villanova after he goes nuts in the Philadelphia Catholic League his senior year not only does he get that scholarship from Villanova Mike he goes on to become the bigest player of the year and now here he is in the NBA so it's a it's a lesson for all young players out there he it sometimes might be a little bit of a late bloomer but if you put the work in and you believe in yourself good things can happen to you he wasn't drafted after his 5 years of college was on the NCAA title team for Nova in 2018 didn't play a heck of a lot but was certainly a part of it a chance get some action here in OKC Wiggins Coast to Coast Aaron Wiggins who got the start tonight a terrific game as well 17 points and six rebounds they are deep they are talented and they are connected they max out to some of their parts me all of these guys are so comfortable with their role and because of Shai Gilgeous Alexander's greatness offensively they can stay in their Lane offensively none of these guys are asked to do more than they're capable of because Shai takes care of all of B Alex ducas the rookie from St Mary's from Australia he's com into the game Damon Lee can't get it the fall it's good to see Damon Lee back on on the floor had that terrible knee injury in preseason last year and missed the entire season and he continues to work his way back he was a really good player Off the Bench prior to the injury yeah big moments in Golden State as well for that for those teams and they came here and he really knows how to score and Jones lays it up and in Dylan Jones The Rookie from Weaver State there you see the bench happy for their for their teammates nice little move there really nice move on bbo that's a lot of length that on it starts moving in a certain direction it's going to be difficult to reverse direction of your b ball off to dribble particularly when you just checked into the game and you're probably a little bit stiff right now it's almost not fair to have to go guard on a close out so Jones who is the the 26th pick in the draft after four years at Weaver State Monday played a season High 25 minutes again the blowout against Milwaukee so just like tonight getting some extra time he had nine rebounds in that game he played some G League he was a really good player his senior year at Weaver State turnover throws ahead Jones makes his move kicks it back out out flaggers in the game three-pointer won't go from Dugas the L be thought about a three boy there's talk about extended time for the bench players b bow you know when B bow has we have a timeout call when bbow has played regular minutes he's actually been quite productive unbelievable skill for a guy his size all OKC tonight though Saturday matchup on ESPN for Eastern Lakers and again Luca dich his expected debut with his new team host the Pacers game also available on ESPN plus and Disney plus it will be fascinating to see how this generational player now plays with arguably one of the greats of all time now it's not arguably that he's one of the greats I don't like getting into that goat discussion but LeBron James and Luca donic on the same team still in shock it was unimaginable that a player like Luka daic at 25 years old having led a team to the finals LED it another year to the Conference Finals the most talented offensive player in the history of the franchise and that's not a slight against Dirk nitzki in a great career he had but just in terms of raw offensive Talent that's Luca but the Mavs in a lot of ways Mike I think they're betting against Luca because of things they have seen and Luca donic now in LA with LeBron is going to be wearing a Lakers uniform for potentially a very long time and let's see if you know what what this does to fuel him and his desire to now prove Dallas wrong and and and win some championships eventually you know it's one of the interesting aspects of this have nothing to do with the on court play of those two b b lines up that three-pointer knocks it down was the reaction of the Mavericks fan basee and it just shows you how much the fans care because they're they're absolutely devastated they're angry you know as Jones draws the foul there and and again it just shows you what players and teams what it means to the fans Not only a great player one of the most entertaining players in the league and that's what you know your guaranteed investment was as a Mavericks fan so I really understand this visceral reaction that has taken place in Dallas around this decision and particularly when there was no talk of it it it just literally came overnight for so many people to wake up in Dallas to find out that this player a lot of whom for for a lot of whom he will be their favorite player of all time and he's no longer in a Maverick uniform that's just a massive adjustment big adjustment for Luca as well well of course the reaction from the players is Dam Lee nice floater there the reaction from the players the shock from them is something that I've never seen as we check in with George you know it's interesting about the shock Factor certainly I spoke to Luca yesterday after his press conference and you could tell he's still processing all of this I asked him you know about what are you going to do about somewhere to live and he said to me he kind of shrugged his shoulders he's like I guess my family and I for a while we're going to be at the hotel and then kind of figure it out and we forget kind of the human aspect of that but remember Brad Townsen who is a local writer in Dallas asked him Point Blank would he have signed that extension in Dallas and Luca didn't waiver he said that there was no indication that he would not have signed it so certainly to your point legs this is something is that is going to be in his crawl and he is going to be out to get those guys when he faces them in February and probably again when he goes to Dallas in April the time will tell obviously with all trades Mike and look make no mistake about it Dallas got a great player in return in Anthony Davis and they're still going to be good and they're going to be very good and they're going to be a factor in the west this year and and for the the next couple of years the way that Nico Harrison put it you know they their window of opportunity but that's not to me what it's about it's about you know the next decade and what LCA donic potentially could be well it'll be fun to see like how will Dallas play will will they be at the same level will they get better will they get dramatically worse Flagler knocks down that three same things with the Lakers will they get better they they lost their key defensive player but now they get this all NBA peren a long NBA player as Gillespie misses that one it's just uh crazy stuff and and as George pointed out with the the human factor nice block shot madaro the human factor of you know they make millions of dollars they have this incredible life but there's still family involved here and your life is completely thrown especially in season to have to move to another place it's uh I I think I think sometimes we underestimate how difficult that can be especially if you have a family moving side shot blocked Garo Jones gets it back and backs it home as we're under two minutes to go well if you're just tuning in the Suns without Kevin Durant obviously had a quite the challenge tonight but they played one of their best halfs of the season and led by two at halftime shot 60% s from the field and then it was one of those tsunamis from the OKC Thunder they outscored the Phoenix Suns 4316 here in the third led by that special talent Shai GES Alexander 50 points for the night and just another dominant win for right now the best team in the NBA as they'll improve to 40 and N yeah this this second half was to me the prototype for what the Thunder have been all season and you could even go back to last year when we saw this and last year Mike we I think we all agreed they were the number one seed in the west but felt it felt like they're not quite ready yet because of the age factor of this team and they get knocked out in the second round by Dallas who ends up in the NBA finals this has a different feel about it this is a team now that's gone through that they've ripened they've matured they've added Talent so they're even deeper than they've and it's amazingly here they're going to be 40 and N they haven't played at full strength all year and then you look at Phoenix and when Phoenix is whole and again the key is when Durant and Booker play this is a team to be reckoned with because they when they're not together it they don't have that margin for error as we said at the top when those two have played together they're 23 and 11 this year 69 and 34 overall and it appears that although you never know the way things have gone Gillespie nice move on a pass from bbo it appears that Durant and Beal and Booker was never involved in any trade rumors that they're going to be with the Suns for this year the talent is there uh it's a matter of of just finding that oncore chemistry getting better defensively you know you you do wonder about that but I do want to get back to this last play did I just see a 71 player off the dri throw a lob to a 61 player yes you did you don't see that very often like at any level of basketball ball ball he's got tremendous skill so a minute to go and what will be the 4th victory of the season for OKC a Garo gets in and fouled by kendri Williams yeah this is not something you see every day so take this one in this is B bow with the up fake gets a Defender and you know what let's see the point guard under the rim for the the lob now not your your typical dunk at the end of this but that's okay gets the an one Colin Gillespie gets himself in the scoring column andc here at home they improved to 23 and three the three home losses two of them were to Dallas and donic didn't play in either of those victories for the Mavericks here at OKC the other loss as Flagler hits another the other loss was to the Golden State Warriors I believe there are seven teams in the league playing above 600 basketball and they are 14 to3 against those teams and they have Holmgren in 13 of those wins they've held teams to 101 points total on average so it's not just that they beat up on you know whoever the mediocre Bottom Feeders they've been doing this against the top teams as well and for the fans that are have stayed throughout and what turned out to be a blowout in the third quarter on their feet they've outscored the sun 7946 here in the second half led by as many as 38 and another victory in front of their loyal fan base they're 40 and N Now 23 and three best record in the NBA as Shai Gilgeous Alexander set another brilliant performance 50 points in 34 minutes as they head toward the All-Star Break Meanwhile Phoenix have lost three in a row and now 25 and 25 on the season as we had not only did he score at will and was unguardable he wore a microphone tonight appreciate it bro you see me like this look appreciate y'all boys and the first quarter I missed a lot of easy could have been 70 that's all right though all right bet his third 50-point game of the season and all in the last seven games and he's with George and the rest of his crew yeah thanks Mike Mike Green just mentioned third 50-point game in the last seven games when it's going like that what's going through your mind just trying to be aggressive play basketball take what the defense gives me trust my work at the end of the day that's all you can really do you can put in the work through the summer times through the off days when you get out here just trust it you guys blitzed them in that third quarter never looked back we saw you talk to your teammates how have you grown from a leadership standpoint yeah just being comfortable in my own skin not doing too much obviously the team can hear me hear from me in a lot of situations because I'm out there on the floor but making sure that I I open my mouth when it's time and and when they need to hear from me and then lastly I'm sure you've seen or heard a lot of teams in the west it's already difficult have loaded up to try to compete against you guys how do you feel about that as a team that teams are trying to load up to go up against you you guys yeah we just worry about ourselves that's all we can do we have a lot of growing to do between now and where we want to be at the end of June and that's what we're focused on trying to get better every day and hopefully our season's long enough to get to Summertime Shai congratulations thank you so much sir appreciate it Mike back to you all right George they have one goal and that's to win an NBA title and that man on his way to another spectacular season and maybe an MVP season final score 140 109 our
