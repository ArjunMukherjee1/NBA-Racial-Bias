adjustments if we need to get to those and then on the offensive end is continuing to execute versus different coverages what have you seen from this group with Kristoff's back uh you know obviously our Rim protection is there um you know and then the offense going doing a great job versus the switch attack uh played Detroit last week they switched us they're a physical team they're a good defensive team uh we were able to handle that a little bit better because of uh just our roles and our and our post presence we got to look to continue that tonight playing without Jayson Tatum what's

magic of the Enchanted Village at Jordan's Furniture in Avon Isaiah Stewart slides in for Detroit with no Jalen Duren no j and Tatum for the Celtics going double big with Al and Kristaps Porzingis key match up presented by Subaru of New England share the love in a brand new all-wheel drive Subaru Cade Cunningham having a fantastic year this year Jaylen Brown getting that chance to sort of set the tone and run the show tonight can't wait for this matchup Health Report by South Coast Health providing the exceptional care you need then now always South Coast Health more than medic of Jayson Tatum out for the second game this year both of them have come against these Detroit Pistons still no Houser with that adapter issue and James Springer also out Jaylen D's a big one for Detroit they typical starting center so they're even smaller than normal scal against this jumbo Celtics starting five but dur is I think a half a step behind still learning how to read the game this group right here might have more switchability so it's going to be important for us to crack these guys off the dribble get to the paint and then make the right play from there both teams haven't played since Saturday this has been an eternity of rest in NBA terms expect them to be fresh and ready to go Zach Zara jumps it up and Chris stops Porzingis wins the opening T Celtics trying to bounce back from that loss to Memphis on Saturday and Jaylen Brown's going to have to do a lot of the heavy lifting tonight with no Jayson Tatum just like it was last Wednesday when the Pistons came here and lost by 10 that was a good game oh cook Al Horford against Jaden Ivey Derrick white for three D white has been ice cold lately you go in his last three games 5 for 26 entering this one from three I think a lot of guys on the Celtics just needed a rest at five and seven we can see it really catch up to guys in that Memphis game yeah one of the busiest weeks of the Year Cade Cunningham likes that mid-range jumper it's no good the Celtics beat Miami Detroit and Milwaukee and then lost to Memphis bookended last week with losses but only have five of them all year 19 and five a game and a half behind Cleveland this match up was feisty last time out Porzingis has it rattle out shot over the top of Stewart who's 68 Cunningham coming off a triple double at Madison Square Gard Tobias Harris scored a lot last Wednesday missed his first shot round the hit ahead to White finds Horford in the corner up and go find take oh St got a big block met him at the summit gave him Mumbo hit him with a finger wag Jaden Ivey two strong on a three white Taps it to Porzingis Jaylen Brown who's had himself a busy week finds Porzingis beautiful feed beautiful shot like Jaylen brown in that playmaker role especially early I think it gets him into the game gets him engaged yeah Jaylen talked about it this week about how he's getting to the free throw line more he's bigger he's faster he's stronger and he knows he he gets into the paint everything else happens after that that's tough look for Cunningham he's missed twice both from the mid-range and here comes Brown ISO is Hard Away likes the matchup bullies him into the paint out to Porzingis extra pass for white oh for two start for Derrick white I'm waiting for these threes to come out of his pockets Hardaway Junior the Miss slow start for Detroit 0 for five from the field remember what happened last Wednesday when the Pistons were here holiday missed the Lefty layup Celtics raced out to a 26-7 lead JB bicker sta put the bench mob in and they close that Gap in a hurry as Cunningham has their first two yeah we got to remember Detroit came off that grueling Milwaukee Cup game where they were trying to qualify for the quarterfinals so they they fought pretty hard against us you can tell they're different from last season oh yeah TV bicker staff's done a fantastic job five to shoot for brown drives past Stewart got B no call and Cunningham picks up the loose ball finds Ivey those guys are fast in transition and Derrick white slams the door two one Porzingis to Brown but he missed the jam Second Chance is good man that would have been cookies to cream back to cookies to cream that would have been double stuffed stacked Oreos Porzingis has all five for the Celtics Cade Cunningham has the two for Detroit lost the the handle stays here five to shoot let's go back man Kristaps Porzingis on the drive Isaiah Stewart that is a big time block look at beef stew get up there by the rim under size it doesn't matter low shot clock Harris has to Fire and he scores Stuart get posterized by Brown last Wednesday he yes that's right by the way Big Time shot by Harris in the block he's T in the block Tobias Harris at 27 in this building last Wednesday you see the difference Porzingis makes protecting the that time Ivey had to go to the floater yeah it's a big difference they know and you know porus is always lifted so him getting back a big pres down there Detroit pushing Tempo cummingham to Ivey the Pistons just can't buy one right now two for 10 oua team is also 2 for 10 that of a clunky start you can tell there's some Rust here time out Celtics one at the moment here's to the doers presented by honeydew buy one get one gift cards are here and so is christops for zingis as Jrue mentioned his help on the interior defending the rim could not come soon enough the numbers are unmistakable since kp's return the Celtics holding opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the league within 5 ft averaging nearly seven blocks the game and the rebound percentage all the way up into the top 10 talking to Chris stops this morning I asked is this a point of emphasis for him and he said always every team that I'm on this is what I bring but he said the thing about it is the trust that I have clearly I'm able to pack the paint you know stating the obvious you have a 7 foot three guy at The Rim it gives you confidence but to be clear it's not just about his height and his length the way Kristoff describes it it's all about team chemistry and this Celtics team defense clearly so much better with Kristaps Porzingis on the floor yeah when you have a guy that's behind you like that you can just guard the perimeter so much more you can close out to a shooter a little bit better it makes a massive difference when you have a shot blocking big he's been aggressive on offense tonight he's already taken six shots which match matches His Highest total in a quarter this year he's got all five points for the Celtics Jaylen Brown trying to enter the scoring column that's a tough shot good defense from Ivey and Stewart the rebound P playing good defense we didn't see that to start the game last time yeah they look totally different Cunningham for three Stewart has an offensive board he plays hard Hardaway Jr missed the three yeah Pistons are also getting a lot of good looks both teams just missing shots like you said just look a little bit Rusty good hands from Ivey Cunningham Harris the jam so is smart play they you force a turnover you want to push the ball you don't want to play against the Celtics half court defense you saw the numbers Porzingis being back there they'll look to run on missed layups block shots and turnovers all six of their points have come in the paint for of them in Fast Break Brown Zips it out to Horford finds light that three pointer is good for three Hardaway with a Fall Away Hardaway loves to score loves to get going early Brown in the spin cycle same pattern here they zip it around the perimeter p is making a conscious effort to run guys off look to drive the close out a little bit more from the Celtic team they're fully committed you rarely see that nowadays but they're they're fully committing to that to that close out JB biger stat the year one Pistons third coach in the last three seasons big cheer as Payton Pritchard enters the game you know he was begging the official dedric Taylor in that last time out Scout let me touch the ball let me just dribble it a little bit dri said no oh man let how you know this guy's a certified ball lover P briter not a star yet though cuz the officials aren't showing him love M they' let a star do that oh yeah tried to heat up in a hurry holiday flies in for the rebound and he shoots himself that's no good holiday had 23 points in the loss to Memphis Saturday Celtics are 44 and two when he scores at least 14 Ausar Thompson back in the lineup for Detroit scores off the pass from Beasley Thompson's a high flyer he's only played in five games this year due to a blood clot situation P was getting h by Beasley and Porzingis right back to Pritchard for three no at all good job by Porzingis recognizing that double team early Richard all over the ball it's Malik Beasley who can fill it up from outside as well as anyone in the league he drives kicks to Harris his three is no good and Brown's got the rebound Jaylen in command here dbes past Cade and gets fouled see I don't hear anybody when Jaylen Brown snaps a full speed crossover I don't hear anybody talking about his handle here look at that we're all the people saying he can't dribble when he does hit they don't say a word that clip doesn't get you views on oh when he loses the ball it's like oh yeah he can't dribble but when you see that full speed snap crossover I don't hear I don't hear a thing it's cuz some people just don't watch they don't watch that people are haters that's why sipping on that haterade everybody can have some Cunningham hits it from the mid-range Detroit leads by one I think he's Bonafide man I really do I think it's just a matter of time before he figures this thing out pump from Jaylen Brown he smack my a pass SC that's the clip he got fou right you could you could hear it our Mike's picked it up he said he smacked my arm  Simone Fontecchio is in the game Tobias Harris takes a seat no I mean when I watch Jaylen Brown play he tries the hardest stuff like the full speed right to left between it between his legs right that's not easy to do even for most NBA players yeah most guys don't do it and he keeps his eyes up at the lane So eventually he just figured it out but a lot of guys wouldn't even try that bball Paul is in the game Paul reach in again no Jaylen Duren tonight pours in the quick hands holiday has Pritchard riding shotgun he gets it to him keeps the dribble alive right back from Kornet offensive rebound for Luke who was stripped by Ausar Thompson he gets his hands on a lot of passes and rebounds vono can cash out I like the pace lot of bricks though both teams are flying now Brown gets him away and scores ter Brown playing through contact time all right Detroit timeout Pistons Jaylen Brown bleading his case holidays don't miss your chance to see the Seas hit the paret before the end of 2024 scan the QR code on your

nine field goals made and nine assists look look at that list JIS Dage Trey young LeBron Westbrook Payton Tim Hardaway Senor tiny Jerry West Oscar Robinson that is Elite this is in the history of the game so right now Cade Cunningham really doing a good job of scoring and distributing and I just think he has the opportunity to be elite if they can figure this thing out in Detroit they can grow a little bit they can be a really good team in the future and JB Baker staff said on my favorite podcast this morning he said Cade's a great leader especially for his age just 23 years old Radio lineup not a podcast stop calling in a podcast everybody can do it yeah this morning on the radio show we had JB bicker staff and uh I mean he's really excited about coaching Cade Cunningham he's a special talent Porzingis foul that oneing Porzingis not wasting anytime watch that the catch and he goes up right away that is his signature shot for the Celtic team yeah it's not just the three-point shooting for Porzingis when he can stretch the defense out to 30 feet and shoot over everybody it's the postup game when Porzingis is in the paint against a mismatch he abused it last year most efficient post scorer in the NBA 1.3 points per 100 possessions and he got to the free thr line a ton which gets us into bonus which helps the team out oh great Brer hit the deck looks like he's okay Malik Beasley over Porzingis Beasley second in the NBA and threes made coming into this one try to get Porzingis on the mismatch and he's fouled by Fontecchio foul on number 19 Simone Fontecchio

to change so for this entire first quarter Joe maou's had two big men out there now it's Horford and Kornet Drew Peterson's in the game after he was a dnp the last two remember no Jayson Tatum no Sam Houser so the Celtics dipping into their depth on the wing Pritchard straight away the offensive rebound get two the foul no s how about Kornet show you the power at The Rim inside position gets it power dribble goes up strong one shot no s though well his s is that fresh cut he's rocking hey man no games from Saturday to Thursday everybody's got a fresh everybody got a fresh forsberg you me Luke everybody about tat fresh lineup he's always the same he gets cut every day think so Paul Reed for three cor that skies for way above the Box the Australians getting that vert way up there Brown givs it to him beat the Beast Peterson on the drive the bouncer Loop for two nice pass by Peterson Drew seems like he's more comfortable by the game Drew Peterson seven up in first for the Celtics with two minutes to play in the first Pistons shoed just seven of 22 32% that's very good defense by Horford Ivey has to give it up Horford again defending Beasley big step out all over that's a tough shot a tough shot Bey professional scorer Richard thought about shooting like 35 ft floats it over bball Paul give me a s give me a s give us something Luke all business with his fresh cut JB bicker staff cuts a timeout they need a solution for the Moose Luke Kornet the Moose is is loose and the SEL Scott six-point lead here's Peterson with the pocket pass over the loop goes up shows off that left hand no s and then Pritchard and Kornet Above the Rim dunks it on big ball Paul no s yeah Lucas all business today all business acting like he's been there before which he has what was he doing the other day mixing it up oh we never got confirmation no I heard it was mixing it up that was mixing it I heard it was mixing it up I just seen too much Zeke Elliot doing the let him eat Reed trying to post up Pritchard now Kornet comes over to me him miss the bunny the defense from Luke Brown into Horford nice cat and finish I love that early seal by Horford Porzingis it just puts a lot of pressure on the defense if they front you go over to top and with our three-point shooting that's a bad move for the defense Al just knows how to play the game man always doing the right thing Reed another three Reed and NS Reed have the same coach shooting coach one's a little more effective than the other cred by re free throws coming Kornet has really improved this part of his game it's his diving this is called a slot dive any kind of guy drives Baseline Kornet's coming down the middle from the other opposite end and uh that's been massive big men aren't used to guarding that when they help you know more than likely a big is not going to time a cut like that Luke typically reliable at the line they stay in the loop with all things Junior Celtics by signing up for the newsletter at

years from now Hardaway the quick attack Hardaway J B prer has nine already K got his hand on it but swatted it out of balance Detroit ball trailing by six so no JT no Houser so Celtics will run with a little bit of a lineup here to see if these guys could figure it out jula's not going to take guys out even if it's not going well he'll let these guys roll out especially in the first half here's Holland call the foul on K as zarba Blows the Whistle on the Baseline foul on number 88 G that's his first holiday checks back in Horford six holid theone big man out there now yeah I'd be shocked

for most games is a quarter zip zip boom they make a quarter zip quarter zip it's actually pretty affordable you know apparently they know their audience they do that'll be Pistons ball after the turnover I can't wait to see this you know scal I thought about asking JB for one to hook me up but I like to support small businesses and I think you know Jaylen some some money to help start that business the great thing about 741 he doesn't need any uh Venture Capital he is the Venture Capital no but if if you just got to call that's that's fine but if we call them we can get you a quarter

Queta Jordan Walsh leaping in the RS holiday walled off by cunning gets through a spot and gets two finally let's go that's my step up guy right there first two points let's get aggressive at 23 points against Memphis but it took him 26 shots to get there it was a new defensive strategy from Taylor Jenkins leave Jrue holiday open on the way down Bon all right let's see Kan it comes over good timing Elevate early my man dude that was close really close that was close they just showed it on the jumbo try anytime they show it on the Jumbotron that means you know whoever's running the Jumbotron disagreed with the call get aggressive Scout step up guy Jrue holiday defended by Cunningham finds pitcher who should really always be our step up guy he gets in the lane fend off Hard Away tried to draw the contact didn't get the call and Holland gets the rebound the speed yeah that's where he's really dangerous on the second nice move he's behind the play fouls white oh we got hit in the face it looks like right in the head too you can see Derrick white grab his head you guys get squirmish or squeamish squeamish squeamish don't watch all right so watch this holl in transition watch this overhand cross right there kind of dip his shoulder get to the rim Lay It Up Detroit fou was on number ZD on the second his second oh that's tough which I would ask what are you doing I I feel bad for the guy I do but like you know you always got to be aware of that stuff there checked on him as he walked past him at half court uh and now Derrick looking at Isaiah Stewart saying what are you talking to me for that gu put his face right behind my head you know if if Derrick still had hair it would have cushioned the blow a little a little bit still would have hurt Comforts of Home presented by Bernie and Phils receive up to a $2,000 MasterCard reward card with a qualifying purchase as Holland collects himself on the bench the Celtics have won 11 in a row against the Pistons it's the longest active streak versus any team now why do we bring this up the Pistons last game Saturday at Madison Square Garden they beat the Knicks which snapped to 16 game losing streak against New York man it's a lot of Gam a lot of gam well in the Eastern Conference so what did that span like three and a half years four years yeah playing three times a year but it doesn't like that Minnesota Toronto thing no that's like 21 years or Minnesota Boston although that I don't know I mean I guess they play once per year at both of those Arenas Thompson couldn't hit the turnaround Here Comes Jaylen Brown back in the game back in control of the offense find Holiday in the corner passes up the shot goes around Harris gets fouled and free throws coming for Jrue holiday see right now Detroit is pre rotating out and the right the right play is to put the ball on the floor but the S need to do is drive kick and then when they make another drive whatever that next kick is going to be it's going to be wide open shot but so far Pistons doing a really good job of scrambling around running guys off the three yeah Celtics three-point rate tonight is below 50% so more than half of those shots have come from inside the yard yeah as Holland getting worked on by the training staff and that's based on the defense you know like I don't know if it's clear as Daye to you guys everyone just think well they jack up threes but it's the pons are going to take away the three other things are going to be open look at the threes for Detroit that is rough brutal 6.7% and they and they've been smoking hot coming into this game holiday with good hands five to shoot for Cunningham he sees it works on holiday has to fire make it one for 16 Pistons are the best three-point shooting team in the league in December Derrick white for three white for three separation from the three-point shooting is starting to occur Pistons 45% in the month of December tops in the league Ausar Thompson missed

that Malik Beasley make it one for 17 holiday the rebound the hit ahead thir oh Stewart with a good challenge that was a little surprising that so talented he's a beast it's funny Scout during that time out I was watching him he's walking next to Jaylen Brown Cade Cunningham is taller than Jaylen brown people don't realize that no he's yeah he's a point guard Porzingis gets the roll poring is going quick right now I think that's been really good for him against his team he's just SM I think I think he's a really special offensive player that will continue to develop he's trending toward another triple double he's got 12 points five boards and four assists Brown playing off two feet has to give it up white defended by Beasley not a strong Defender Pistons better than 50% each to their last two games they are struggling tonight so Beasley takes matters into his own hands yeah Beasley could score it and he always plays hard this is a tough aside Porzingis against Harris again that time he took his time no one came went right over the top of Tobias Harris Kristaps Porzingis the first Celtic into double figures tonight 11 points Ivey hits the three Jen Ivey for yeah that's a good time for the piston I mean if you think about they if they can't shoot with the Celtics they got no shot at all down by nine PR a big from the T logo why didn't we pick him as our step of C just do it every night it won't be a segment if we pick prer every single time good challenge from White at The Rim Brown and merges with the rock gives it up holiday back to White oh it is a parage of Threes rich with the drive two more his first two-point field goal tonight Celtics lead by 177 by Porzingis don't go in there o this place would have popped if he hit that that would have been the unicorn in a nutshell a block and a deep three shot that from 27 ftol is called for the foul they had one to give there's Kristaps Porzingis rustling back so but keeping his body away from guys so he doesn't put him on the free throw line hand part of the ball there that's okay a dunk say like a junior high ball like you play man it's different the grown man's game I just don't want anyone sitting at home being like that's a foul no no no no on a dunk nah you ain't getting that arm yeah hand no you ain't calling that a wi is that a high school Main Street I you got to give me your highlight your your mixtape I'd like to watch his hands he is a talent former number one pick out of Oklahoma state only yic and LeBron have more triple doubles than he does this year brown eye on the clock refuses to screen kicks it out big out this the three Here Comes Harris 5 seconds left in the second quarter he's got to get rid of it Stewart will shoot from the mid-range they let him take it and that's why next end of the first half f with the score stay tuned for Celtics halftime live presented by Ace Ticket with Tom Giles and Eddie House 15-point Edge for the Celtics what do you think yeah barrage of Threes in the second quarter really made the difference if they could continue like this the D's going to have to eventually make some shots to sit two for 19 and that is a major difference in this game yeah two for 19 against one of the best three-point shooting teams ever not going to get the job done aby's with Payton Pritchard thank you guys Payton did you hear that Ovation you received the first time you checked in tonight what is that like uh it's a special feeling I I definitely appreciate the the Boston crowd and I'm going to keep going hard for them so I definitely am appreciative it was a barrage of offense in that second quarter what opened up for you guys guys this the pace played played really fast JB was getting downhill uh D me Jrue and then guys were connected so we play fast like that we can get open looks and uh keep it going Payton thank you very much best of luck in the second half Celtics up 15 at the half don't go anywhere half time live is next 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven eight I'm really really hot I'm really really hot tou the time is now it's our time it's game time it's go time it's no time like right now we shine it's our time it's crunch time it's show time there's no M give us something Luke sights and sounds brought to you by TD Bank America's most convenient bank a Luke s would have certainly made it on there inste it's us complaining about no Luke s it's time for the experience From the Bench presented by experience Abu Dhabi discover more about the incredible City visit Abu Dhabi a Abby chin what'd you learn got a chance to speak with DJ mlay he said our transition defense has been better tonight we need to continue that rebound the ball as for offensively and what opened up in that second quarter he said I really feel like we're shooting the same shot same shots they just started going in I would agree with that sometimes that happens first half stats by Jason Stone injury lawyers official injury law firm of the Boston Celtics injured better phone Stone Derrick white starts the third with a three and that is the difference I I thought we were getting good shots and we just started we just started knocking him down be playing Celtic basketball Jen I has your answer now the Pistons you saw only made two threes in the first half that is a season low in a first half by a Celtics opponent Miami made three in a first half the lowest for either half is one by Washington in October Wizards made 13 in the second half of that game which was their season opening oh I I remember that that is Brut T Stewart the rebound Jaden Ivey tries another I'm sure coach bicker staff is saying guys we can play this game but if we don't start knocking down threes we'll lose this game that Jaylen Brown keeps doing that that's his first three-point shot all night yeah he's played more of a facilitator role today how about this scy he only had four points in the first half he was a plus 20 you can tell he's just he has a good hold on this game Tobias Harris with a Miss Celtics with that starting five out there no Tatum tonight so Horford and Porzingis started together TP the fulcrum of the offense out there shoots over Stewart left it short coming got a deep bag he missed the shot but Harris cleans it up good offense JB for two and one that time it was cream and cookies they reversed the Alle that is true look at this flick the wrist he catches it and just flips it right up there sweet pass even better finish you know they're switching rolles on the Alle maybe they'll switch rolls on the car ride back from the airport next time maybe Jaylen will get to have the aux instead of christops they'll listen to something other than Spanish trap at in the morning maybe JB B will be driving and he'll get to decide what they listen to you know we should get on that playlist we should try to find the Spanish trap music in I think that's what Porzingis likes to listen to spent some time in Spain when he was younger he's fluent in Spanish worldly guy Hardaway lost the ball Derrick white says I'll take that oh this is cook Jabs on Ivey miss the shot Brown yelling at Zach Zara he where's my call Harris missed it Horford defending here is trying to get a technical they're not going to slow down the Celtic break there it is there it isoul they're saying he's saying it's it's a goal tank Al Horford slapped the glass let's see now hor we've seen this a million times tracking the ball if he get a piece of that he might have usually Tatum's a guy to take those technical free throws poor zingis does it tonight knocks it down let's see I need a fingertip on this ball maybe but it was before hit the backboard regardless yeah but you're not allowed the glass like that I mean surpris Harr would have a right to from playe but if Al just nicked the ball you could slap the glass like that oh Jaylen Browns are cutting him to the weight room but just left it Short's Ball but do you think Tobias Harris did that on purpose getting that technical foul or is that only something a coach would do no I think a player would do yeah he had no doubt he want he was he was arguing to get aack I don't know set a tone you know I have no idea what he was thinking Jen Ivey off balance well CU sometimes I think Joe moula said this earlier this year he's trying to get a technical change the energy of the game Kum does that too like yeah some guys want to do that whoa that would have been sick if poor zingis had thrown that thing foris the mismatch and the banker we've had a ton of success with those early post UPS Celtics on the spot with their passing timeout JB Bickerstaff SS by 20 it by Macy's welcome back to the garden and tonight after Celtics postgame live tune in for Celtics postup Cayla Burton and Chris forsberg take a look at the lighter side of the Celtics in the NBA it's presented by Eastern Propane and oil they're in your neighborhood all right story in the third quarter little Jaylen Brown by the way in 21 minutes plus 25 there's the pull-up jumper there's Jaylen Brown on this cut cream the cookies and the sweet layup and one and then Porzingis running the floor early post up S it's got about three or four of those today right now the rest much needed and right now clicking on all cylinders the lead is 20 the largest all night just four minutes into the third quarter can Detroit respond they did last Wednesday went down by 19 really early in that game and battled back K coming over Porzingis tough tough like he's like sus a separator amongst these guys on the Pistons right he does little things too to create space right that's the Luca comparison yeah holiday hooks it up poring over the top now you really can Porzingis the top score tonight with 17 J hard J holiday the step back oh that's good just an absolute barrage of Threes since that first quarter these guys are shooting it at a high clip Celtics are a plus 30 from Beyond The Ark they've made 10 more Ivey fouled that's not at the roll fouls on number seven not living right in and out there's the hand elevates it's Z kind of knife for the Pistons you think that's what me would say you're not living right that's why you don't no I didn't say that I didn't say that I don't want Mom to come after me game leaders brought to you by Arbella Insurance here for New England sports fans here for good Marcus sasher getting his first action tonight didn't play at all in the first half L corette was fantastic in that first quarter places Al Horford here without naming names I know a lot of guys who weren't living right got all the rules tell me off the air it's just a way of saying hey you're living right you know Jaden's mother Neel the head coach at Notre Dame Powerhouse women's college hoops Zach Zara alerts the scores table of an issue with the shot clock I saw Muffet McGrath at ESPN a week ago mafa mcra who was replaced by Neel Ivey after she retired as the Notre head coach great program there in South Ben big to Big cor Porzingis back to Luke out to Derrick white Celtics basketball they're getting fancy over here three oh no look got there's a sing you were talking about he was spilled on the looks a little sore like he's all right Harris catching shoot Harris lead is still 20 for the Celtics Browns pass taken away by Sasser that's what he can do give you some defensive energy Off the Bench Ivey ho the three off the top of the back this should be out of bounds right no I didn't go all the way over go all the way over Joe maou is arguing but Celtics ended up with it brown the extra pass for Luke right back to JB Harris picks him up Porzingis Ivey hits the deck no Jil urance tonight for the pist playing small Stewart's the center whose ball is that they'll stay here how about the bigs going big to big and back again to the kick out DK white Strokes it Derrick Derrick White six Payton Pritchard enters anyone who complains about the Celtics taking too many threes they don't move the ball watch that possession yeah no I thought in Memphis we took a lot of Threes I feel like of of the of the one game that we're like man that's a little too many I thought early on in that game we T we shot a lot but it wouldn't like we didn't battle in the second holiday got his own cleans it up you had holiday porz and Kornet all around the ball right there I like my chances with the Celtics scoring on that possession five Celtics in double figures and holidays filling up the stat sheet hunningham missed it Porzingis on the curl out to Jrue s nice floting remember he changed the game about a week ago just came in with a ton of energy got some steals got to the basket he was tough JB biger step brought in the bench unit and parus SAS was kind of the head of the snake for them five to shoot Pritchard go goes at him drops it off for Kornet oh that goes cor got 10 10 points and all business no sties tonight Celtics by 22 timeout Detroit third quarter Celtics up 22 electric moment is presented by Audi pit Year New England Audi dealer today is Payton Pritchard and he is back in full effect knocking down threes from all over the court no hesitation whatsoever inside off the dribble catching shoot deep threes a little bit of Defense in there as well creating turnovers P Pritchard just doing work all day today I love his aggressive mindset we're seeing more of that and now he's drawing double teams on drives and making plays and making people around it better that is your electric moment six times for Payton Pritchard 14 point points three boards Drew Peterson back in the game Paul Reed in there for Detroit with Sasser Beasley Fontecchio and Ausar Thompson Reed on the roll good finish PR good passing yeah a nice set play from picker staff out that time out great read by Beasley Brown works on Bono scores over Jen Brown has show us so many things that he could do today look at Porzingis moving his feet oh get that out of here Ausar Thompson tried to punch it Luke and Kristaps Porzingis both in the area Porzingis gets credit for the block Brown rejected by re kp's block was incredible look at the timing hand is already up meet you at The Rim Thompson some kind of athlete huh dude that's a 73 guy playing perimeter defense painton pritzer from the e in TD Garden we are not worthy Marcus Sasser for two I got 25 ft on that Pritchard three on my play bypl je it felt like it was longer no I I thought it I thought it was a lot further than that thought it was like 30 two minutes to play the quarter goes back to work here CLS it inside for por wanted to call it and get it corette the offensive rebound no reset no problem man the Celtics just look so dominant tonight this is the type of game you want to see after that type of layoff little rusty shooting to start but now they're fresh Jaylen Brown a little jelly Jaylen Brown so many different ways to beat you so many different ways to score to attack you to compromise your G defense we're seeing all of it today this is a bad possession I don't know where you go with Porzingis and Kornet out there you're not going to get anything at the rim and the subel guards are in your airace brown to Porzingis stays here is that something you think the coaches are telling them hey we got two big out there go ahead and get up in them yeah let's see how long this there is no way that's just 25 ft that's got to be 30 ft easy I think so Porzingis takes a seat Horford back in the game Brown to inbound floats it up Pritchard the catch playing a little football against Sasser now he wants to score but he lost the h two on two Easley Peterson called for the foul just the second foul against the Celtics in the quarter and just the fifth all night off the turnover Beasley let's take a look one two Peterson hands up in the air got a little bit of arm yeah it's just knowing your personnel Jrue like if if you got two bigs in there then you want to make sure you run guys off you know there's always going to be one guy at The Rim there's never going to be a chance with this group out there where the rim is not protected so get into the airspace anytime we play double big that's the advantage of it now you saw that play that Porzingis made if they're able to make plays like that The Bigs then you truly have no weaknesses Porzingis has multiple blocks in three straight games too Paul Reed with the takeaway B Teo drives Kornet call for the foul and he'll help up Fontecchio now Detroit's running off of our turnovers there's vono there's big Luke with the body line Shoto 79% on the year and here here's a message from FanDuel any NBA play can Inspire your next hunch and with FanDuel you can turn them into big wins let's go right now new customers bet $5 to get 150 in bonus bets if you win 5c Difference game clock and shot clock Horford trying to get it to prri Sasser denied him the pass and pitri Creed some space a little bit of a offensive pass interference there fouls on Ausar Thompson I'm nothing this get off me it was right in front of us first in the last two minutes Pistons had a foul to give so no free throws Pritchard holding on to his left thumb PR be that th got to get healthy Peterson a nice catch Pritchard from the corner blocked by Sasser he is just a tornado defensively that'll count it's a 25-point lead for the Celtics as we go to the fourth quarter threes are starting to fall Jaylen Brown at the center of it all little Jam little jelly SS by 2 5 12 minute three brought to you by Sullivan Ty we're always here to get you there late when we have big leads in the fourth quarter Celtics just want to execute but the one thing they have to do is take care of the ball you saw Detroit run on those last two turnovers stats through three brought to you by Jason Stone injury lawyers official injury law firm of the Boston Celtics injured better phone Stone well the three-point shot is the nameing the game here there's an 113 difference I don't know how you make that you can't knock down shots 27 assists for the Celtics through three quarters that'll do on 35 minute shots let me use Queta back out there to start the fourth plane with Drew Peterson these guys played a lot together in Maine and Queta travel travel violation Detroit that's one area I feel like Queta needs to improve on is when you set a screen and you get out of it you have to get out loaded like you're waiting to go Above the Rim so a guy could throw it up almost like he rolls out and then decides later he's got to come out with the idea that this L might be there and I got to be above that Rim this is a really small lineup for Detroit Cunningham in the post kick it out Ron Holland and the rookie rattles in the three and looks at the Celtics bench as he cuts it to a 22-point lead prob told him shoots 18% Porzingis up top that's a good example Porzingis Rose ready to jump ready to go above that Rim Cade's got to get used to that play this is interesting I guess Harris is technically their center right now meanwhile the Celtics have Porzingis and Queta assass travels can't do that yeah the reason the reason the Celtics play double big I mentioned earlier it's it's just to make sure that you have a guy at The Rim the whole time but look at Kristaps Porzingis get out look at his body he's wa ready just times it up really well he knows as soon as I get out of that I'm just timing up the alley Porzingis has 19 points leading away for the Celtics white and Pritchard both have 17 all out there right now Porzingis on the Block against Cunningham double comes skips the pass to Peterson feeds D white for ring D White fourth quarter that's Jrue step up guy and uh you said 30 though I'm just going to let you know that's what you told me hey 10 minutes left bro he's he's only at 20 ha a challenge Cunningham and Cade scored anyway yeah I don't know if K could have played any better defense Cunningham just tough DWI 6 for 11 from downtown after he had struggled in his last three back on track tonight five to shoot Porzingis against Sasser find Pritchard again a deep one oh poor zingis mtim his jump but still got a hand on it Celtics get back Cunningham hoist Richard working on the glass white saves it to him great defense and great hustle Richard creates some space midle post up give too little he is about bad life 19 points and seven helpers for Payton Pritchard in 25 minutes top bench score in the NBA Sasser for three offensive rebound he'll re-trigger this time he hits about Payton Pritchard coming off the bench has scored 19 plus in seven of his last eight games yeah besides the one goose yeah against Milwaukee I mean that's like that's crazy consistency but one scoreless game but aside from that he's 19 points every night and he's coming off the bench Queta Taps it Peterson's got it Porzingis loads it up Holland Dives and gives it up for Ivey JB calls the timeout with his team trailing by 24 8 and 1 half to play just one timeout left T the season to Deck the Halls with Celtics Pride find the perfect gifts for the Celtics fans and your life shop now to

as much as everyone else out there the Celtics get back at back to it on Sunday they are in Washington I don't know how they managed to draw two of the worst teams in the league picking up these games due to the tournament but we will take it and then on Thursday and Saturday is a home and home with the Chicago Bulls leading into Christmas week that should be a fun one the important thing to note all of those games right here on NBC Sports Boston with your hometown team you know I don't feel as bad about losing to the Hawks and I hope the rest of Celtic fans feel the same way the Hawks during the this tournament beat us beat the Cavs and then beat the Knicks like this there was a really impressive run by them they look dominating all those games on the road too they look dominent in that game last night Trey Young's roll in the dice on the Nick's logo he loves playing in New York sure guys the Knicks look tremendous I'm sorry the Hawks look tremendous they're like the Grim Reaper for the top teams in the EAS know they're coming for everybody K to the floater yeah that wasn't like they got lucky they ain't Lucky in any of those games okay to the steel Richard on the break tried to run it down ran into Peterson I think that pass was for Peterson yeah Peterson is supposed to Sprint to the corner can't shortcut anything in this game Scott let me ask you this are the Hawks like a legit Contender no not a contender but they are a legit team to beat you in a first round legit they could shock somebody oh yeah they've done such a nice job protecting Trey young oh building that team around him for sure 100% And I there were the point and I'm watching I'm thinking how are you ever going to be able to protect Trey young in this day and age with so many good players and so much shooting but they figured it out and give Quint cider credit but also Landry fields and going out there and getting a bunch of Defenders that really fit in well with them and they managed to get Dyson Daniels even though the Pelicans really didn't want to give him up they were really reluctant to trade him oh man I hate those stories some of the reporting is oh oh the pr work by some of these guys man Bernie Lee's not putting up with that man oh you see that oh yeah Jimmy Butler's agent you didn't see what he said about Chums go check that out Derrick white for three he said shs C's tweets on chat GPT that was pretty funny that was funny oh man we're not taking shots of Chance by the way a aent aent sham beep is pretty awesome Cunningham got the rebound off his Miss hul in the drive white

speed of the game for sure prer creates some space Payton Richard he's got to be one of the most fun players to watch in the NBA we get to do it every night you see the tools from Ron Holland footwork Final 5 minutes presented by Eastern Bank join us for good Ron Holland is emptying the B man he is he do a work right now he's got 16 points seven of nine shooting oh brard yeah that's not the defense
