 down that board how tight it is in particular between three and number eight right now all right here we go the Dallas Mavericks have the first possession John goal Brett Bari Simone joks a threers officiating crew team split the first two games in Denver as Lively drops one in and here come the Denver Nuggets 22 and 15 overall seven games over 500 for the first time this year good to see Murray in the lineup now Porter can't shoot West's got it against Klay Thompson Jokic and Jokic has it knocked away Marshall's on the Run he's been kind of a thorn in the Nugget side this season nji Marshall well you just can't beat yourself on the road by trying to do too much offensively make the simple play and then look to get your teammates involved nuggets have the fourth best offense in the league they're trying to improve their defense which is 19 but much better so far in January now Porter cranks up a long three rattles out and Lively the rebound without Luka Doncic without Kyrie Irving and Dante exom the three out for the Dallas Mavericks well to Scott Hastings earlier point that makes you know these next two games even more valuable for the Nuggets to try and take advantage of that snap Pass Christian Braun's got it and they knock it away Klay Thompson getting his hand in there Mavericks have won their last two now Lively's inside he dumps it in and once again the nuggets to a slow start and the Dallas Mavericks too scoring all six of their points their eight points in the paint they's six points they've only scored six points so far it seems like eight I I'll give you that inside and that shot is swatted against the backboard so credited a block shot for lively Thompson now going to be picked up by border Jr and another switch Spencer Dinwiddie the former Colorado buff star well traveled but still a good player he's yo-yoing against Murray Murray good defense and that rattles out and Jokic goes and gets it Jokic new haircut looking frisky over to Westbrook that's no good Jokic has the rebound Jokic inside lay it up and in and the nuggets on the board yeah the Mavericks weren't ready to defend on that offensive rebound and Nikola Jokic looking for a pass at first but then just goes right around Washington six to2 here in the early going crowd settling in a rare daytime game but it is Sunday inside Washington passes off got a wide open look and down it goes you can't be focused so much on the basketball defensively that you lose sight of your man and that's what felt like happened in that defensive possession for Denver Michael Porter Jr helping inside early seveno lead now bord got it inside snapped away Westbrook's got it westbr waiting for Jokic here he comes oh Jokic traveled I thought but he's going to be rewarded with some free throws here all right so let's take a look at the Denver Nuggets defense on that last possession and it's Marshall that takes advantage Michael Porter J's coming inside but look at him focusing entirely on Washington driving into the paint have to be able to see both and know your distance enough to be able to Sprint Out close out to the shooter especially from the corner let's bring in Scott jix hey hey Katie on that play you just showed right there if you see Michael his man is high and and moves doesn't stand in one place cuz Michael's first move was back to where the guy was it was pretty good play by the offensive player too sure the Mavericks shoot about 39 threes per game which is a lot and they're a pretty good three-point shooting team at 38% now hand off Thompson one of the great three-point Shooters in NBA history swing it to Marshall and the layup is good just returning from a four game suspension he got in an altercation with Yousef nurkic now Murray down he goes Mavericks have it Mavericks rolling here 11 to three Thompson on corks of three that's good going be a timeout coming as they have KD in recent game slow start really tough start for the Denver Nuggets the Mavericks getting all up in the paint scoring the Mavs let's take a look at how the Denver Nuggets will ensure the win when they get going Katie well first and foremost clean the glass the nuggets are 14 and five when they outrebound their opponent and Dallas is a really good offensive rebounding team so have to take care of that battle second paint your picture both of these teams Elite paint scoring offenses top 10 in the NBA so the nuggets they need to get out in run score in Fast Break situations win that paint battle tonight and based on how the first four minutes have gone Chris I'm going to add this one take care of the basketball the nuggets have already turned the ball over three times the Dallas Mavericks have scored seven points off of those turnovers you can't keep turning the ball over at that rate or you'll have no chance you see Jason kid there he talks about effort and energy the two things you can control can't control whether the ball goes in can't control how you're going to shoot but energy and effort are key strives to have that for 82 gamees now Jokic in on live Jokic turn little fallway jumper is short Westbrook couldn't grab the rebound and here come the match winners of their last two games over the Lakers and Portland and surviving quite nicely without their two stars Thompson's in the lane any rolls at home Klay Thompson had struggled in the first two meetings between these two teams 10 points total so you don't want to let him get hot here in this third matchup 16 to three the nuggets have fallen behind here in the first quarter Jokic lets it Go rattles out another Miss shot for the good guys the Nuggets one of seven long range that's good and the nuggets are getting pummeled here and again last game Klay Thompson only had three points so he's coming into this game looking very aggressive for his shot the nuggets have to be aware of where he is now Westbrook's in the lane give toic had a 15-footer passes it up now guarded by Denwood by Dinwiddie in the lane drops it in well the Nuggets may have gotten the Dallas Mavericks overconfident so goal number one is is good to go and at this point the way this game has gone now it's about weather the storm still look for your offense your great shot selection and you have to get stops defensively to Chip Away back into it chop some wood for the rest of the first quarter here's Thompson for NBA titles with the Golden State Warriors Lively comes up with the offensive rebound now now they swing it under the Lively back and the dunk is good by PJ Washington he's been playing well he had 23 and 14 rebounds Thursday against the Blazers and shooting well from outside a career high 38% Murray sets up Braun for three Braun is Off the Mark he's been shooting better in January over 40% after a dismal December Washington's in the lane and it's a nuggets foul that's a good paint three Look for Christian Braun two offensively Jamal Murray getting inside kicking it out Christian Braun's been shooting the three ball better so he confidently steps in those are the type of looks you want to get on offense but you got to get back and be able to defend without fouling be more disciplined in game plan execution now the Mavs as a free throw shooting team 18th in the league 77 12% PJ Washington rattles out now Daniel Gafford will come in along with quentin Grimes Christian Braun is going to go out for the Denver Nuggets he's replaced by Julian Strawther so the usual substitution pattern well and you wonder too here sometimes Jamal Murray is the first one that comes out of the game so him Coach Malone putting Julian Strawther in you need some scoring you need some Shooters out there to catch fire get some energy into this Denver Nuggets team Str can do that Washington misses both now Jokic coming in on Gafford Murray turns the corner little floater no good but on the weak side there's Porter those little extra effort opportuni is they're big when you're trying to make a comeback so Michael Porter Jr crashing the offensive glass order averaging about seven and a half rebounds per game to go with 19 points Jokic got his hand in but the Nuggets couldn't come up with it yeah Jamal Murray was there on the help side but took a gamble trying to go for that steal and it landed him out of position 23 to seven here in the first quarter glad you're with us on altitude a rare Day game as Porter unloads a three that's no good long lead pass Washington's out there that's be a foul on Denver now Murray is going to go out and he's going to be replaced by pton Watson take a look at that last play Mavericks running in transition and again you have to be pointing and talking and matching up and being aware of where players are running in passing Lanes when they're trying to get out on Fast Break Mavs a good home team 12 and six on the road they're 500 at 10 and 10 and that'll be a foul on Russell Westbrook coach Michael Malone talking about his team and the focus they need in these two games against the Mavericks without their Stars now Corner three nope inside ball knocked away retrieved and Porter with the deflection nice activity defensively from Denver there too flying around being in gaps pton Watson getting a hand on it Michael Porter juder getting a hand on it you want to throw Dallas's offense out of rhythm a little bit so PJ Washington with Denwood he Grimes Gafford and Maxi Kleber is also in CBA hasn't been getting much time lately with all the bigs and porters alone under the bucket nice pass good Vision there yeah great find from Russell Westbrook and he dribbled out a little bit to kind of get the proper passing angle have the defense shift so he could find Michael Porter Jr inside Washington no out of the reach of Gafford Westbrook's got it the nuggets the NBA's leading fast break team pass into Jokic what a spectacular pass ball knocked out of jokic's hands and now Washington let's go Dinwiddie sizing up strawther and Dinwiddie draws the foul we're going go back to this Russell Westbrook pass he's had a couple really nice looks so far in this game the last couple possessions really in the eyes he talked about him and Nikola okic don't really have to speak they just know by looking at each other and and sharing body language and that's how their chemistry continues to rise and develop in Wy free throw is good good look at Nikolaa Jokic now in his 10th Year from Serbia a rare Day game so the Nuggets fans in Serbia get a chance to watch their hero as Aaron Gordon comes on for the first time Gordon who was hurt in the Christmas Day game missed nine games with a calf injury there he is and maybe he can inject some life into the Denver Nuggets Z them up a little bit I see what you did there now Dinwiddie always like Dinwiddie been a good player wherever he's gone just solid yeah they got plenty of depth on this uh Dallas team 24 to 9 Westbrook works in the lane lay it up and in with a left hand good burst by Russell yeah what an impressive finish too around some of the bigs Gafford inside Westbrook extending now dwood that's short Gordon's got it Gordon On The Run give it to Peyton Watson Watson Wheels into the key now Westbrook and that's going to be a foul on Hardy so Jaden Hardy is a third-year guard into the game wearing number one came out of the G League ignite good player can score the ball that was a smart play too because Hardy much smaller player than Aaron Gordon and him fouling AG down low gives Dallas a chance to rematch reset and get the defensive looks that they're looking for just second team foul on Dallas now Gordon Gordon into the key got five P got rattles at home people don't remember that Gordon got hurt well G one of the reasons why the Nuggets haven't been quite as consistent he's got a little pep in his step early in this game to you can tell he's just so excited to be back playing basketball again nuggets down by 12 biggest lead was 16 and Hardy for a long three Hardy has been shooting 53% from three the last two games it's one of the players that coach Malone said he's most nervous about have to know where he is now Jokic Wheels into the middle of the key puts it up an in Nikola Jokic doing Jokic kind of things he's got seven points four rebounds and it's a 28-5 lead Dallas ahead Jokic up at the level Gafford inside and Gord making a difference when he comes over from the weak side and the pass is intercepted now long range Grimes ouch that's the other one the last two games Grimes that's been knocking it down from Deep 47% from three Hardy and Grimes those two you need to know their names know where they are on the floor Grimes had six threes in a game against the Lakers recently so he can shoot it up Jokic and we've got a foul Jokic thought they weren't going to call it so he passed off and we'll take time out now the Nuggets try to work their way back into this one they Trail third 31- 15 yeah it's good to have AG back in the sou nuggets trailing on this special Sunday it's here time now to go Star watching presented by Royal Caribbean sounds like fun doesn't it Russell Westbrook Nikola Jokic you look at the triple double list old time separated by the great big old Oscar Robertson Magic Johnson LeBron James trailing it's an incredible duel and they've been playing well together the History Channel is what we're watching Westbrook and Jokic first pair of teammates to record triple doubles in the same game twice tce in the same season and we're just getting started it feels like when it comes to Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic not only with the way they played together but their production and their triple doubles that they can have on on the same night yeah remember Jokic had missed the previous two games because of sickness comes back with a monster triple double got a whistle and a foul foul called by Brent barck holding what's been the story of this first quarter the turnovers for the nuggets have really hurt them four turnovers for 10 points off of those turnovers and then Dallas has just been converting on everything they're shooting 67% from the field 83% from the three-point line and the nuggets have yet to hit a three and shooting 41% Murray trying to get away Murray picked up by Gafford into Jokic trouble three to shoot Jokic falling away no and Grimes goes and gets the rebound not the kind of possession you want to have when you're trailing by 16 you have to be more intentional with what you're doing offensively right now every shot has to be a smart one and Gafford misses but he'll shoot two wow the fact that Gafford split Jamal Murray and Julian Strawther in the air there too looks like they both went straight up to contest but Gafford just snuck right through the Gap can a little guy get in there and take the charge is that a possibility no one saying they can't yeah it's always a possibility you look at Gafford who shoots 67% from the free throw line first one is good hey if you're injured no attorney is more qualified to know and to speak about your injuries than the doctor who's also a lawyer Dr Joseph Ramos Ramos law.com I'm Chris Marlo with ktie wiy and Scott Hastings glad you're with us today as the Nuggets who have one two straight trying to battle back kind of a crummy first quarter I would have to say just not the strongest of starts but the nuggets have come back plenty of times already we know that's a part of their identity what they're capable of best team in the league at that got 10 10-point comebacks and Murray is fouled quentin Grimes is asking for a replay or a challenge perhaps we got two shots coming up but I don't know if Dallas wants to take that early so I believe Grimes is asking for the offensive push off there with Jamal Murray and his left arm kind of extending to create space Murray is the Nuggets leading free throw shooter 86% wow well you know things are off when Jamal Murray is missing free throws this has not been an outstanding first quarter for the Denver Nuggets look at the numbers for Murray improving missed them both I hate to see what the guys who are not the leading free throw shooters on the Nuggets do today free throw shooting has been a concern all season long nugget start off one of four switch out on party now long three no good Jokic has it nugget want to run every opportunity give it to Gordon Gordon tracks it down Strawther dble Drive come underneath put it up no and Gafford there with a bother as we used to call it when Chris Birdman Anderson roam the planet for the Denver Nuggets now n Mar Marshall trying to back his way in 32- 15 17-point lead the biggest of the night inside no Jokic bats it and it's out of bounds and everything that could go wrong in this first quarter is happening to the Denver Nuggets it just looks disconnected really on both sides of the basketball the nuggets have been fouling too much defensively not in the proper coverages and then offensively taking some really difficult shots letting the shot clock wind down have to be have execute on a much higher level Murray goes out Watson is in now right under the bucket going to try to Power It Up He travel get the bunny hop in the P patch well if you're going to have a bad quarter first one is a good one to have because you've got two three and four to catch up is that that's a glass half full mentality right there it is I learned that at San Diego State back in the day now Jokic with it foul line extended and Gordon gets the bounce a a kind bounce that Aaron Gordon played four minutes got four points a couple of rebounds 3217 nuggets our behind once again no Doncic no Kyrie Irving no Dante exom for the maps Hardy that was pretty good defense there sure was Porter's got it Porter heave at the end of the half or at the end of the quarter I should say and that is no good now the Nuggets got a bad start they Trail it 32 17 you're watching altitude your home

Professionals for all your residential and Commercial Roofing needs go with the pros Red Hawk Roofing and by Advent Health reminding us to never underestimate the human Spirit they are back in the Lone Star stage at the American Airline Center Jokic getting his customary rest here at the top of the second quarter DeAndre Jordan replaces him I'm Chris Marlo with ktie wiie Scott Hastings a big question Katie was that offense or defense in that first quarter a little bit of both a little bit of both because it's the offense okay DeAndre Jordan maybe that'll jump start the Denver Nuggets but the offense when score 17 points let's get a little Scott Hastings I I'm going I'm going pure offense on that one you scored 15 points right or 17 points but you gave up 10 off your turnovers and that's part of your offense also so now I mean it could have been a 227 first half and then you'd be saying hey the defense pretty good in that quarter Watson's pass to Gordon so let's set the Nuggets line up they've got one starter and that's Russell Westbrook with Str Watson Gordon and Jordan the one area defensively that I would love to see the Nuggets improve as their three-point defense five of seven for the Mavs in that first quarter Gordon rolls into the paint and Thunders it through so an interesting lineup here for the Denver Nuggets athletic powerful let's see if this group can catch up in the non Nikola Jokic minutes now nji Marshall shaking and bacon give it to Thompson Thompson long range three straight away got it Peyton Watson got through that pretty quick but it's risky to go under any screen when you're defending Klay Thompson you really want to stay attached to his hip and make him feel you 14-point lead westbr and now it's taken away it's two onone against westbr and Westbrook Smothers the shooter but he's going to be called for a foul it's a good foul you don't give the Dallas Mavericks a chance to get an end one opportunity right there shut it down right away another turnover to Scott Hastings point that is part of offense where you're giving up possessions you're taking away opportunities for you to score and the Nuggets now up to five turnovers so far in this game and Dallas has converted on a lot of those 10 points off of them B is already six of eight from the free throw line Katie mentioned that the Nuggets zero for six from three-point L one for four from the free throw line now Porter comes back in So Dallas is six of eight from the three-point line and the nuggets are 0 for six now we just showed that on the screen but that is that discrepancy is playing a major factor in the score of this game Hardy got it so 37-21 lead back up to 16 biggest lead was 17 Westbrook 15 nice DeAndre Jordan in that screening action too he's so good at at finding a body getting a teammate open and Russell Westbrook knows if if I'm coming off DJ I'm going to be open pass under and ly wide open for the dunk so active bigs for the Dallas Mavericks very effective inside missed Jordan had it Jordan tried to Power It Up does and a foul so the former Dallas Maverick DeAndre Jordan wearing number six the number he wore in Dallas when he was there for half a season he'll head to the free throw line and deander Jordan created that opportunity for himself because he saw Russell Westbrook driving in Sprints down the lane cuz he recognized my Defender Lively was going over to help I'm going to be open and available to get this offensive rebounds is able to secure it goes up so strong Nuggets won the first moving in November 122 to 120 then lost the second also in November a little bit later ball knocked out nuggets have it Strawther Long three that's no good and Dallas on the attack Marshall's in the lane floats it no DeAndre Jordan after it he's got it chance for the fast break order slows it down nuggets trailing by 14  Strawther's wide open and he buries it great offensive execution right there too just flowing into it in a transition situation couple handoffs and you want Julian Strawther shooting the way that he's been shooting the ball lately for the Nuggets last three games 47% from the three-point line Julian Strawther might be heating up here in Dallas Denver the Nuggets traing by 11 but still showing a a little bit life asard Toyota Co is going to go to a little history talked about history with the triple doubles the other night with Denver how about this Nicks hooks up with Franklin that first quarter did you guys know it's the first rookie to rookie touchdown no that can't be NFL well if it isn't it's Andy's fault and not mine I'm just reading the card but Troy Franklin uh just two catches so far on the night it's not going good for the the Denver Broncos just two catches that one right there 43 yards and a touchdown Broncos trailing 287 and again Buffalo threatening need more cowbell Scott yeah you need more running back now the Nuggets Putting on the Ritz now they cut the lead to single digits 39-3 this group looks good in the non Nikola Jokic minutes they are playing with so much great energy right now that's a defensive mistake that's wide open Lively a dunking machine well deander Jordan had to come up there higher than he wanted to which left Lively open underneath Aaron Gordon playing for the first time since Christmas Little Fall Away boy he was playing great Before Christmas too he was off to a terrific start the whole season he's been playing great when he has been available and and healthy and so Aaron Gordon the question is where is he at stamina wise conditioning wise it looks like he's hasn't missed a beat Lively's inside and he travels well we've been told that he's on a minutes restriction so we'll see how many he plays today as Jokic chatting up the fellas Andrew mson a yuck yuck there little buddy right next door Jokic holding Court I guess is what I'd say the king in his court well and I I enjoy seeing this look of the Denver Nuggets bench because con Nikola yoka just constantly talking with coaches and teammates and how do I where where what are we doing here what are the coverages maybe we need to reconsider doing these things and and so when he talks everybody listens so we got a reach foul there you wonder if there's a little r strategizing going on MH one thing the Nuggets I think are really good at if they get off to a bad start of their Trail making adjustments figuring out other things to do other matchups  Strawther's in the lane Westbrook's got it nuggets trailing by nine trying to get a little bit closer strawther three to shoot  Strawther's on the run and he knocks it in wanted a foul didn't get it so the Nuggets cut the lead to seven and the Dallas fans a little bit antsy now the Nuggets offensively are running strawther off of so much screening and dribble handoff AC Thompson from distance oh Thompson has had the hot hand how about Klay Thompson in just 11 minutes he has 14 first half points we're coming back nuggets down by 10 have so far here in the second quarter 17 to 12 gaining a little momentum right now it's time to take off with South air Southwest Airlines and it's good to have Aaron Gordon back taking off and jamming through a view that we missed immensely Aaron Gordon up and in perfect from the field so far in this game four of four and AG throwing it down as a sight for Sor eyes a takeoff with Southwest Airlines so Gordon as we mentioned on the minutes restriction he goes out now and so it'll be Porter and Westbrook with strawther Gordon is out so let's take a look Jokic there that's good news so Jokic and Watson Str Porter and Westbrook to five on the floor for Denver Jokic held to seven points in his first stint five rebounds see if the Nuggets can make this group work nuggets got to within seven got off to a bad start and down goes strawther just tripped over his own feet right there trying to flare off of that screen and Russell Westbrook threw it exactly to where he thought Strawther was going to be 4434 Dallas Ellis got off in case you just joined us look at that defense by Russell Westbrook now Westbrooks On The Run Westbrook all the way Crank It Up Russell 4436 the speed and the way that Westbrook controls it is so fun to watch 84 and three for Westbrook so far Dinwiddie he into the corner good close out by strawther and another foul by Dinwiddie Westbrook getting up high defensively to contest and help out as Nikola Jokic had to step up goes straight up in the air handles the contact gets the rebound and then if no one's going to stop the ball Russell Westbrook's going to take it all the way himself so difficult to stop when he gets a full steam ahead of him Daniel Gafford is at the line 67% on the season knocks it in full head of steam did I say that correctly yeah okay great Christian Braun comes in he replaces Michael Porter Jr junior Four Points a couple of rebounds in his 12 minutes Gafford kind of a key for this Mavs team they're 17 and seven when Gafford scores 10 or more looking for his fifth point today gets it the interchangeability too between Gafford and Lively and the way that they play so similarly it's it the Mavs don't lose a beat when they're big is out remember this is a Dallas team that played in the NBA Finals a year ago lost to Boston now Jokic on the run and the Gafford put it up no but he's foul Jokic has some Mavs jumping trying to block that shot and Jokic to the line Gafford picks up his second foul that's third team foul nuggets you know are not a good free throw shooting team 27th in the Le at 76% Jokic drills it they've been getting to the free throw line quite a bit though and just unable to convert at a super high rate but I do think that helps them in a game like this where you're working your way back trying to catch up to a lead get to the free throw line find a way to see some of those go down we look at what Jokic has done against alas this year big triple doubles Jokic with 15 triples on the SE he at 145 in his career Westbrook has 202 he's the alltime leader now Braun is in the guard Thompson shut him off he's been the big story Strawther with a nice interception Braun's got to give it to Jokic Jokic over to Strather he sets he fires no way short picked out by Braun wide open is Murray nobody sees him he's over here Braun inside give it to yoke Jokic and they say traveling Jokic still trying to shake off the effects of being out for a couple of games and having the flu Dallas's defense did a pretty good job of of taking away initial action there even though the Nuggets were able to get an offensive rebound Dallas did a good job of covering up and helping and and M going to send that double team to Nikola Jokic nuggets Trail by as many 17 they're now back by 9 N nearing the Midway point of the second quarter Dinwiddie pass it out Kleber wide open and he knocks it in Maxi's always been a pretty good three-point shooter but this season only shooting 26% 15 points for Dallas on turnovers and off Murray and they get the blue arrow going here Murray around to Jokic screen Murray's got room and and he rattles it home Murray and Jokic obviously know how to operate together so well Jamal Drive drives and and draws that Defender off so he's either got that pocket pass to Jokic and if they're late he can get the shot off just the first bucket for Jamal Murray now Grimes long range no good Watson's got it Watson coming off a good game the other night eighton Watson 10 points seven rebounds couple of blocks and Maxi Kleber complaining I was set I believe there's a good look at Maxi he was born in verburg Germany the same town that produced The Great Dirk nitzky the Hall of Famer verberg with a Big W you're going to have to point that one out on the map for me where the tall basketball players are hiding out now Jokic doubled immediately Jokic going quick to beat the double turn put it up missed it and it'll be Nuggets basketball oh Jokic it's amazing how much contact he plays through night after night after night doesn't seem to bother him Dallas Mavericks are sending a double team immediately to get the ball out of his hands too nugas have a 14se second holds on the clock now Jokic in in witty skip it strawther corner Corner three nope and Watson after it Braun's got it Braun put it up and in so the Nuggets is starting to get on the glass offensively and they cut the lead to eight coach Malone was talking about how many games they I get the played in January too sters miss the last two short long range and three shots coming up here Michael Malone has talked about this all season long that the team has to stop fouling jump Shooters particularly three-point shooters tell us before the last game Chris that the Nuggets lead the league that's what he said in fouling jump Shooters I believe it free throw by DW he is good hey let's go over to Hastings hey real fast guys here let me tell you a secret I'm right here in front of him so I can show you too uh uh guys try to do this all the time you try to go by get get a little touch on the chin or a little touch on the chest or in the stomach or maybe they come by shoot act like you're shooting Nick Nick shoot you tapped the elbow just a little bit Denver's not getting away with that's what Christian Braun tried to do he went by tried to just give a little flip up of the arm and you're right Chris they f as many as anybody in the league and and the problem is they're not getting away with those little touches that some some people get away with now Westbrook back in drives to the bucket and he is f i I really do like the mentality of I want to get a good close out in I like that that's the mindset of the Nuggets but you have to be able to do so in a way that's under control where you have Poise and you can contest the shot without fouling and Russell Westbrook if you if you watch him when he defends he closes out right in between the player's eyes almost every time and he's learned that he's mastered that but if you can't do that there's no need to be risky get there close out make them feel your pressure apply that pressure do so in a way that's not fing now Grimes goes out Lively is back in you see Russell Westbrook as a starter 12 and four with Russell Westbrook in the starting line you pointed out but even better with him and Jokic just those two 11 and three when they both start 52 to 41 as the Nuggets free throw shooting causing pain they're two of nine yis with a deflection three on two Westbrook H to Braun and it's swatted by Lively Watson for three spinner Peyton Watson did he hurt himself looks like he came down little K there pton Watson from the corner knocking it in nuggets closed to within eight once again Kleber and Kleber stepped out of bounds so the Nuggets pressure defense doing a little bit better now well and then offensively too they're not giving up on possessions 14-2 Second Chance scoring nuggets can get a little closer now Westbrook picked up by Lively that means Jokic can go into the post against Maxi the pass was low I don't know how Jokic digs those it's like a like a short stop in baseball let's go back to Watson who makes the three but watch his feet at the end of this comes down a little bit ouch right there little bit of tweak Watson's still in however 5244 our score Murray for three no and that's going to be a foul on lively I think over the back of Jokic boy you want Murray to make that shot I know that's that's as good of a look as Jamal Murray is going to get trapping that Defender underneath the Nikola Jokic screen can't ask for much more than that no that's bread and butter usually for Murray Murray just two points on one of three shoo remember Jamal Murray questionable coming into this game too that left knee is still bugging him a little bit Jokic free throw good Red Hawk Roofing is your local experienced Professionals for all the residential and Commercial Roofing needs go with the pros Red Hawk Roofing Murray with just two points as we mentioned a couple of fouls Jokic makes two Jokic the first and only nugget in double figures with 10 points five rebounds couple of assists but the nuggets are within six that's good news they trailed at one point by 17 Kleber long range Nails it well they're giving Kleber that long three well that's unar he's shooting 26% from three on the season to for him to knock down two in a row is very uncharacteristic like Zone here Murray got it to Murray Jamal Murray answers back and sometimes you know Jamal Murray makes the tougher ones misses that wide open one wants another another chance at it creates an opportunity for himself there now another Corner three coming up and that's good too Naji Marshall Naji who shoots 30% he's making him now Murray on the dribble Drive in the lane hang throw it up no tip it up yes the big Tipper doing his thing Nikola Jokic Jokic now with 12 points to go with the six rebounds nugget hanging around 5851 ready Murray picks up Dinwiddie nine to shoot Dinwiddie going to back his way in Murray Stout and Dinwiddie a three-point opportunity Dinwiddie very crafty in the post well and Jamal Murray loves posting up as a guard he's defended it he knows you know what to get to offensively has gone up against it defensively and right there Dinwiddie does a really good job of going down into drawing the fing going up what's interesting about that replay is that Murray's in good defensive position but he can't let him knock him back a foot knock him back he's got to stand his ground or go for the ball fake there just go straight up that's Jamal Murray's third foul by the way 61- 51 and it's a kick ball it is incredible to your earlier point about the passes that Westbrook makes to Nikola Jokic that Jokic yes he has long arms can get down there to grab it but Westbrook Russell Westbrook puts it just in the perfect position for Jokic to be able to access it Westbrook 85 and four so far now Porter cranks up a three and gets it boy that helps oh Michael Porter Jr puts one in the bucket 61 to 54 Nikola Jokic is fifth in the entire NBA in screen assists per game and such a good screen like Michael por Jr needs no time to get that shot off and it's because Nikola Jokic sets up a great screen didn't he one-on-one against quarter Porter's got the length and he utilizes it DW he got hit in the face nuggets have five on four and five on three Westbrook got it and in the back court Dinwiddie is hurt the former buff got poked in the eye it looked like and suddenly the nuggets are within five Russell Westbrook setting the tone with the way that he has been running the floor and scoring in transition for the Denver Nuggets what an acrobatic finish from start to finish here yeah getting serious about defense great rebound from Nikola leic who of course is immediately looking down the floor in Russell Westbrook again no one coming out to pick up the ball so Russell Westbrook using his momentum a beautiful Up and Under around the defense nuggets have made some progress here in the second quarter here's some second quarter stats nuggets out scoring Dallas by 10 you look at Westbrook he needed 38 points tonight to catch Vince Carter on the all-time scoring list Vince is 21st Westbrook is 22nd those Second Chance points too the Nuggets finding ways to create extra opportunities 13 to nothing in the second quarter and then points in the paint after Dallas got off to a really good start inside which opened up their three-point game the nuggets have been dominant in the paint since then Maverick are still shooting a high rate 57% but the nuggets have come up to 52% so Scott Hastings offense starting to come alive for the Denver Nuggets well and it's it's been the three-point shooting really that's hurt the Nuggets Dallas is 10 to 14 from 3 71% have to be able to cool off the Mavs from Deep to finish this first half and into the second well the Nuggets did not make a a three by my count in that first quarter so they made four here in quarter number two we' got a minute 25 remaining a Sixpoint they get a five-point Dallas lead nuggets trying to get stops get out on the break Thompson into the corner got a three on the way that's no good hit the corner of the basket don't forget the First Bank halftime report is coming up very very soon now Westbrook working with Jokic Jokic has a smaller man two on him now great pass underneath pass it out Porters On The Run y into the lane and he is fouled W Porter has really perfected a lot of the nuggets have Braun is good at the euro Jokic is fantastic yes Porter is improving Russell Westbrook Going Up and Under and kicking it out to Michael Porter Jr CLE is able to get out close out and contest but Porter putting on display much more than just a three-point shooter can drive right in draws the foul let's see if the Nuggets can make some free throws here there's one watching Nikola Jokic in the post maneuver and look at his options if you are a a basketball nerd a basketball Junkie I mean there's like nothing better than watching that in slow motion and seeing him evaluate nuggets uh getting a play Dallas without Luka Doncic you saw him there in civvies seven straight points for Denver as we're trying to close out the second quarter in style d wty guarded by Braun now Lively's in the key left hand that's no good and Lively hustles up the rebound and he stepped out of bounds while he was doing it so the Nuggets get a break and will have the ball that was a good heads up defensive play by Michael Porter Jr to stunting at Lively to allow Jokic to get back to his own man and then recovering doing a better job now so the Nuggets down by just three they could tie it with a get within one with the deuce screen and roll Westbrook and that's off a foot so the shot clock is off 8.2 remaining remember when you kick it the clock resets to 14 8.2 remaining they're going to bring back in Gafford Lively with two fouls Gafford has two to he's more Expendable Westbrook into Jokic and it's knocked away Watson's got it falling away no good and that well there's going to be 510 of a second remaining so a heave coming up or not Klay Thompson he'll take one not a bad one but that is the end of the first half so the Nuggets Trail by as many as 17 behind Nikola Jokic fight back and at the break they Trail by 3 61 to 58 that's the end of the first half officially stick around for the First Bank halftime report Christopher a Dempsey and Bill Hans coming right after Toyota stores now fighting back here in Big D down by 177 at one point now down by three but right now it's time to check in with Scott Hastings and Andrew mson presented by Health one what was the difference a lot of points off turnovers that first quarter cut them down a little bit what what' you guys do different yeah for sure obviously you know we got to be a little cleaner with the ball that that help set your defense and then that we were a lot more physical in that second quarter especially with with all their Shooters we got to you know amp up that physicality and it's still a long long season in front of us but I feel like the way the bench is playing including that second quarter is really start to come together here in the last handful of games oh yeah they they were a real spark for us especially to start that second quarter you know DJ pton Julian all those guys Aaron Gordon obviously helps have him coming off the bench but uh those guys are great and we'll need him again in the second half you you getting any sleep yet a little bit she's sleeping good through the night that's good almost a year now so we're doing good congratulations man good luck second down thanks Scott Ben scored 20 points in that first half and Christian Braun dunks one to start off the third quarter you saw Scott Hastings and Andrew son along with Katy wian Chris Marlo the nuggets are within one they started this game they were down 19-3 at the outset bad start but they fought their way all the way back and on the road against the short-handed Dallas Mavericks little pullup jumper is no good and Westbrook has it Russell Westbrook was spectacular in that first half in terms of pace down to Braun fumbled at a moment now y's trying to get position Dallas doubling behind the back Porter if you ever needed to make one in in and out Braun there put it up and in and the Nugget have their first lead of the the daytime 62-61 and that's 20 second chance points in this game for the Denver Nuggets to the Mavericks to and Marshall navigating the Baseline the lead is back to Dallas oh westbr going to try the bank shot that's no no good Mavs right behind the Denver Nuggets in the standing at 22 and 16 overall they're Fifth and easily Lively putting it in over Porter yeah you really don't even want to be in that position with how big Lively is Michael Porter Jr sliding over to help and Lively can just shoot right over him there and off the Murray ball Jokic Dives nuggets dig it out out to Braun he sets he fires short there have been quite a a few three-point shots that have been missed short and you have to wonder if nug just need to get their legs underneath them a little bit more here Spenser DW he know hustles up the rebound but it flies to Jokic outlet give it to Braun here he comes lay it up and in Rock Chalk Jay Hawk Christian and Braun the Brauns got eight points now and the Nuggets back to within one BL Thompson was huge in that first half and Lively going to work and he is working over Michael Porter Jr on the outside defense so 6764 our score Dallas leads before we go a break let's head back up to Chris Dempsey for The Inter Mountain Health Sports break Demps you want to end a season but certainly a better season than most of us thought that they might have uh 10 wins um and a bright future so uh good luck to the Denver Broncos nuggets down by three we'll get you back to American Airlines Center in a minut by iata the proud local sponsor of the Denver Nuggets download the free app using Code nuggets to start earning cash back of groceries and more today and by Advent Health reminding us to never underestimate the human Spirit downtown Dallas Texas the Mavs at home hosting the Nuggets today our camera not working you know you know why that hasn't been working Scott cuz your head has been hitting it there's Hastings uh let's go to Scott Hastings for a report Porter junr no how's this look hey Andy in the truck is this okay hi hi everybody I think people would pay extra to have that camera turned on you for the whole game just a little box Scott Hastings cam oh you you'd see some rage some rage looking going on I think I think I fixed the camera oh Hastings you just hit it again well listen I have a personal space and your cord goes about 8 Ines into my personal space and and see like can you stop backing up please I cannot personal space with all right let's see if the Nuggets can get going here Murray and Murray's in and out tip by Jokic no Klay Thompson's got it someone's got to pick him up Westbrook does couple guys who know each other very well for a lively good pick up by Porter outside the paint Lively Porter bumping him and he'll pick up a foul but I think that's a kind of aggressive stance you want to have against Lively well you heard Andrew mson too tell Scott Hastings at halftime we want to be more physical we want to inject physicality into this game he thought they did a better job of it at the second half but Michael Porter Jr there much better and a pretty good recovery there by Porters they tried to back door him when he has to be the L man and slide over and defend lively that's when he does need to do his work early and be very physical because Lively is that much bigger of a player both teams with their starters in here at the top of the third no Doncic no Kyrie Thompson no another rebound to Jokic nine boards for Jokic to go with 12 points Westbrook on the backand no Thompson's got it out to Marshall down the middle the Lively look Lively got hit but they're going to call a foul call though that's very late they waited to see if it went in first Jokic is going to pick up the personal and it looks like Yas Jokic almost was looking to take a charge here yeah they Jokic frustrated there don't love that one think a pretty good call if he calls it a second ear there it's a foul prior foul yes a foul Fair yes yeah here's Jokic bleeding again now they're trying to patch up the hand of Nikola Jokic there's contact here for sure it's the initial reach that's the foul but the fact that they didn't call till after he got the rebound and the shot was missed is applicable agreed Jean Dan shinsky oh it's all over his jersey this is going to be a problem yeah you're not allowed to have well you're not supposed to have blood on your jersey he's going to have to go get a New Jersey maybe they're going to let him play with it maybe battle wounds AA Jokic the three-time MVP six time Allstar two triple doubles in the first two games against Dallas tonight or today I should say 12 points nine rebounds four assists just 13 assists for the Nuggets a low total to I mean it just Nikola eic's Jersey right now just looks like he just went to war there it is Lively gets a couple I like Lively he's good player seconde man picked him up play his college ball at Duke the 12th overall pick 2023 Porter he's do here we go nope had a great look there 6964 an 8 to2 Run for the mass after the nuggets have taken the lead another long range that's a two-pointer for Marshall Dall is pushing the lead here nuggets need to hoop this time down twom man game Murray turns the corner Murray in the lane puts it up no Murray getting some good looks Porter getting good looks they're just not putting him in yeah no and and it almost feels that last Michael Porter Junior look he was fading away Jamal Murray went into Lively but then faded away left it short can't shy away from contact there into Jokic pretty good game plan by Dallas the double inside to Westbrook yes and a foul Nikola leic spotting Westbrook and a chance for a traditional three-point P well and Jokic is is The Mastermind right when he gets double teamed he's constantly looking and trying to get rid of the ball as quickly as possible to make the defense pay gets it in the postup situation and Westbrook no hesitation because he knows Jokic is going to get double that he's going to be available there's like a convoy of guys that are cutting to the basket as soon as Jokic gets it Westbrook has 13 Jokic picks up his fifth assist good pass and Thompson is fouled and one thirl Jokic are going to pick up the foul third for him so because Klay Thompson has shot the ball the way that he has in this game Jamal Murray goes high side with him and Thompson recognizes that and curl cuts to the basket which forces Jokic to have to come over and help Thompson in the last game I think you mentioned this KD was scoreless 0 for eight and zero for four from three he's got 17 today the Nuggets trailing by eight Mavs having a hissy they think the Nuggets touched them well the officials don't know so they're going to jump it up here look like it's off the open Strawther Dallas head Mavs are going to challenge this too it does go off of Nikola okic so they'll likely win this so break in the action the Green Lantern will be lit after review jokic causes the ball to go out of bounds there before the challenge is successful it will be Dallas's basketball all right so Dallas earns an extra challenge you can see it fairly clearly here off Jokic fingers and out of bounds and that's the power of deflections too right there Nikola Jokic has a New Jersey on after dealing with the battle that he went through early on you look at the uh live odds update brought to you by FanDuel it's 5 and 1/2 Point favorite and now they are 2 and 1/2 Point Underdog Chris Marlo Katy wiie Scott Hastings has had the momentum going they've been outscored 13- four here in the latest little run Thompson and right over Michael Porter Jr Klay Thompson because of the work he's done early in this game is just in that zone right now as a shooter four of six from the three-point line one minute in the Nuggets had a onepoint lead of 6261 here they go again loose ball lugas trying to come up with it they can't Thompson for three time out Denver that's one you really wish you could dig out get back Klay Thompson is the one you don't want to leave open well 12 point lead for the man ah this is the best picture look my family great picture this is actually the perfect explanation of my life and my family you never see them but they always here had one lead at 6261 since then ktie wiy they've been outscored 18 to5 what's going on here well the Hope too is the way that the second unit came in in in that first half and and provided that spark provided that energy maybe they can do something similar but right now Klay Thompson is is having his way yeah he's lighting them up with the Denver Nuggets the first two meetings he did not have that but Thompson is one of the best Shooters in this league he can get hot at any time so you have to know where he is and he's been in Rhythm the Nuggets again have to do something different against him get the ball out of his hands here he's a season high is 29 career high is 60 see if the Nuggets get a little momentum here in the second part of the third quarter Julian  Strawther's come on so is pton Watson and the other thing that's really hurting the Nuggets is the turnovers I mean again the start of the game the start of the third quarter both times it's been sloppy offensively 10 turnovers for the Nuggets once again a cost of 20 points Thompson feeling it here he comes and Westbrook strips it out of his hands out of bounds it should be a surpris to no one that okay we need to stop Klay Thompson who's going to guard him Russell Westbrook Russell Westbrook's going to say I got him he's mine Westbrook likes to guard the toughest Challenge on the other team we found that out the other night Marshall into the lane little push off got it so now it's a 20 to5 run and the nuggets are losing contact here the double on Jokic Braun for three and the Nuggets can't convert well Dallas's game plan of doubling the Kio every time he's in the Blocker on the elbow has been working the Nuggets got to make those shots Thompson with pton Watson in his face that's good defense by the youngster bad pass another turnover nug not getting the opportunities to score down the middle of Washington this has been a stretch to forget K after the nuggets started so promisingly after a good second quarter and they've just gone dormant here after you have uh you know a couple turnovers in a row that's when you need to slow it down work into some great action but every time Nikola Jokic has gotten the basketball who you want to play through in situations like that they send that double team and he's finding his teammates they have to make plays let's go over to AC here's another thing with that double team Katie not only are they doing that then they're clogging the lane for Cutters and they and they're daring Dinwiddie to to try to go out and make a three and the last I looked they were four of 18 so it's none of those games when they're shooting 20% from the three-point line that they really struggle to score so it it's it's concerted effort double Jokic Clogg the lane and let Denver prove they can make a shot it's working four for 19 now Scotty 21% and Jokic being held by lively that's the scoring there 22-9 and the Nuggets scored 17 points in the first quarter now they only have nine here in the third quarter we're talking about the fourth best offense in the NBA being held well under their average Jokic going to take a three Marshall with a rebound 8367 Westbrook's got it it's three on three Westbrook turns on the Jets offensive fou anticipating that was Jaden Hardy he's definitely moving he's sliding into it that can be a blocking foul I don't think the nuggets are going to review it though concerned for head coach Michael Malone here in the third quarter Thompson side stepping good again and Thompson's just getting exactly to his spots getting to his spots on the floor he averages 14 points per game with the Dallas Mavericks and right now he's already at 25 points six of nine as Watson answers the Bell Naji Marshall M finally miss one Westbrook for three four minutes to go third quarter they call that on the shooter or did they call that on straw they're trying to get through there they called it on the screen though so it'll just be because the nuggets have five fouls already in this period the Mavs are in the bonus the rest of the way here Gafford will head to the free throw line so as we get this sorted out Mavs want to bring a couple players in nuggets want to insert Aaron Gordon into the lineup he can use his Edge free throw is good time now to see he was making a real difference presented by Chipotle well tonight it's member of the opposition Klay Thompson 25 points as KD pointed out nine of 15 six of nine threes just to put some perspective on this too with the first two meetings between these two teams four of 21 Klay Thompson was 19% from the field one of 10 from the three-point line so the Nuggets had limited him in the best way in the first two meetings and now he's just having himself a night and an offensive rebound for Dallas Dallas lead up to 18 they want Maxi to shoot it he does and Watson they're going to say it's off with Peyton Watson leg here I believe Watson hustling after it in the corner it's really difficult to get momentum back if you're the nuggets and try and work your way into this game with all of the choppiness that the Dallas Mavericks are utilizing to their advantage here getting offensive rebounds getting the ball out of bounds here those hustle plays are making a big difference Corner jumpers no good once again offensive rebound down Hardy lets it go no Jokic has it Jokic being hounded bring it back to Murray Murray pulls for three that's no good once again the Nuggets LED 6261 their only lead since that time they've been out scored 25-7 Gafford wedges his way another offensive rebound Jason kid in the pregame presser talked about energy and effort and certainly the Dallas Mavericks have brought that today that's exactly what they're showing on the floor I mean that at least particularly in this third quarter where they have come out of the locker room and and really set the tone with that putting on display how much those little plays can make a big difference in a game here we go defense defense Murray's had a quiet game at doic Jokic is in the lane drops at home kokic keeps playing he's got a double double 14 Points 11 rebounds five assists Murray gets his first assist of the day Westbrook has 137 and seven Hardy hey missed it good rebound by Murray nuggas have to chop into this league a little bit Murray on the left hand layup good a good way to do that too scoring in transition getting out and running in Fast Break situations lead cut to 14 215 remaining here in the third Dinwiddie contested Watson's got it try the euro on Maxi no give it to Murray Murray flurry right about now Murray's in the lane turn drop it up and in pretty patient inside there from Jamal Murray too he was serving his options down low little spin move to create some space and some time nuggets were down by 19 they've cut the lead to 12 Hardy under duress that's no good another rebound to Jokic that's 12 boards Jokic pushing the pace snap it to Watson oh and Watson left it short they're going to bail him out with a foul call so maybe there's body on that that we didn't see initially I mean barely on the the lower right hand here watch Dinwiddie on the hip yeah he's got the hand in Scott Hastings will tell you once you got the forearm in no you don't like that free throw is good Burke Simpson reminds you that when the game is on the line 303 79 0252 five Burg Simpson good lawyers changing lives Spencer Dinwiddie could use a lawyer about now to argue that foul call now nuggets trying to cut the lead to 10 rockson 6 points five rebounds now seven and five so producing Off the Bench You know despite this game going the way it has in the first quarter and the third quarter in particular Denver's only down 10 yep plenty of time remaining get a couple here Dinwiddie got Murray on his back Murray chasing Denwood turn put it up an in a professional score is Spencer Dinwiddie Jokic back to Murray oh Gordon was open he volleyballs it into the corner Watson for three no rebound quentin Grimes and Grimes can't handle it so a turnover there an opportunity for Denver here got to make some shots got to find a way to get some of those threes to drop Denver Nuggets four of 23 177% to the three-point line here another one screen and roll Murray being hounded Jokic on the dribble Drive pops it out to Strawther Strawther lets it go that's way off Jokic right there put it up no but a foul no chance there for a three-point play couldn't quite get it well Nikola Jokic as a AA right now feels very much like okay I understand that I need to be more aggressive I need to take over both on offense and defense he's flying around a little bit more getting more physical defensively and then on offense he's deliberately seeking out his own shots to try and get the Nuggets back in this game of course he's always playing the right way Jokic five of seven at the free throw line now nuggets have missed seven on the day as Klay Thompson going to come back in replacing Lively Braun and Westbrook come on for the Denver Nuggets the Lively sits Lively's day 14 points seven assists and five rebounds so he's turned into a very good all around player yage gets to Jokic improving his double double if you like to 16 and 13 with five assists and a 10-point deficit nuggets have overcome the most 10-point deficits in the League this season if you're wondering they've done a 10 different times down by 10 or more now Hardy picked up by Jokic Hardy over the top that's no good a good box out Christian Braun's got it got to heave it kind of go no almost so Mavs led by 19 nuggets cut the lead to 10 8979 Dallas you're watching altitude Sports your home for Nuggets basketball that was our refreshing rewind presented by Ball Corporation Allin for the Nuggets aluminum Allin I'm Chris Marlo with Katie wiie and Scott Hastings nuggets out scored 2821 in that third quarter a 20 to5 run was really the biggest problem for Denver and now they find themselves on the south end of a 9179 score Aaron Gordon is in the subs with Murray Murray in the lane Up and Under with the left hand no wouldn't drop and it's going to be Nuggets basketball so the Nuggets uh with Murray strw Watson Gordon and Jordan the Mavericks with PJ Washington Klay Thompson Dinwiddie Grimes and kach see if this group can do what they did in the second quarter Strawther floer too hard playay Thompson with it gets it back side steps left nope Gordon's got it oneon-one goes Gordon off the window yes so Aaron Gordon coming off the bench he made all four shots in the first half makes his first shot here in the fourth quarter 9181 pretty isolation play from Aaron Gordon 2 just taking advantage of that one-on-one coverage down low DeAndre Jordan collects the rebound off the Miss but then what he finally missed one now Murray's got it Murray with nine points tonight uncorks one got it Murray flurry Katie would you accept it will you accept this flurry absolutely accept I would like a Murray blizzard to be honest with you right now 9183 intercepted Peyton Watson off to the race as we go over to Murray got to have it Murray for three yes again you get stops on defense you're operating well offensively just continue to chip away long range no good flies to Murray nuggets down by five trying to push it now Murray over to Gordon Gordon against ca he knows he's got Gordon's going to shoot a three and hits it air Gordon gave Jamal from gave Jamal Murray a little wink after that one too say you like what you see wow you talk about playing catchup fast Murray Gordon and the rest of the crew hoist it my friend we'll take timeout here come the nuggets two scoring run and Clos to within two 9189 time now to see who is all in presented by Ball Corporation Allin for the Nuggets aluminum all in it's nice having Aaron Gordon back he just brings so many elements he can score he can rebound he defends he he passes and he creates a little fear I think boy he's just so tough he he implements so much toughness was is contagious on this Denver Nugget team he's been perfect from the field six of six one of one you can tell that he's just so grateful to be back on the floor playing he is on a minute's restriction but the nuggets have needed every one of his minutes now can the Nuggets defend here get a little bit closer kleo for three rattles out the kleo made two threes as ktie pointed out he wasn't shooting the three ball very well alyo to Jordan Miss Jordan the former Dallas MAV ties it up at 91 let's go to Hastings hey real fast guys plus minus hting everything but the starters all in minus and just like they did in the second quarter the the whole bench is plus and plus big 41 to 29 in that second quarter nuggets it's been now kleo try it again that's no good Mavs have gone cold a bit Denver could get its second lead of the afternoon oh we thought about it maybe a little too far out how about screen and roll with Murray no Murray's oneon-one Here Comes Gordon Murray trying to get around the corner on Kleber Murray's in trouble Murray Lay It Up locked that's a head up play by Washington to slide over there and the Little Euro saw a fourpoint switch there and what Murray was doing on the other end is he gets the switch has CLE on him but then he draws the help side over but by that point the shot clock was already down he didn't have another choice he's got to keep pushing here and off Murray he's got to be important draws C again Murray Up and Under yes and a foul so Jamal Murray luring CBA into the tarpit he's playing with two incredibly good screeners too Jamal Murray DeAndre Jordan Aaron Gordon he basically picks who he wants to come and set that screen he's been hunting for that matchup with CBA and right there Jamal Murray makes him bite on that shot fake Murray trying to give the nuggets the lead and he does he had missed his only two free throws and now the nuggets have their second lead of the afternoon 9493 Klay Thompson had the hot hand and the ball knocked out of bounds by a hustling DeAndre Jordan to Scott Hastings point it's not very often that the Denver Nuggets second unit comes in and can save the day but both stints so far in this game the second unit has made all the difference star performers today now long range mat trying to get back on track and DeAndre Jordan is tried to take no he tried to get that foul because that's Murray's fourth inside Murray battling down low with Gafford trying to get proper positioning that bant that was a bant effort DJ wide open shot by PJ Washington did not go 9493 Denver 7 and a half to go at the American Airlines Center Western Conference contenders alyu and Gafford rocks the cbba there that was Julian Strawther underneath that Gafford pushed off of a little bit to create that space so he could fly Murray picked up by Naji Marshall is good Defender hate to shoot Murray in trouble give it to Strawther Strather in the lane Murray's got it two to shoot does he know it going to have to Cork one he does and it's a 24 second shot clock violation and those are the possessions that really hurt you late in the game you want to be getting a great shot off every single offensive possession when it's this close down the wire have to be aware and execute at a high level so just under seven minutes to go and a one-point game Russell Westbrook back in kic will be back in soon we think din witty Gordon saying that was a pass Dinwiddie goes right to the free throw line and here comes Jokic Jokic coming in with 646 now again the nuggets have to make the Mavericks pay when they do send that double team late in this game have to be smart out of those situations Red Hawk Roofing is your local experienced professionals for all your residential and Commercial Roofing needs go with the pros Red Hawk Roofing Chris Marlo Scott Hastings ktie wiie in Dallas for the matina it's a good one the nuggets are caught all the way back from a 19point deficit and here we are Dallas by two 641 to go how much of a difference can Jokic make usually a lot now Gordon one-on-one against Thompson and we got a defensive 3 second violation now this is interesting because usually Murray would take the tech but they're going to send Jokic up there Nikola Jokic will shoot he's got 16 points 13 rebounds five assists despite being double and triple team the entire afternoon get it Aaron Gordon too reminding us just how high his basketball IQ is we talk so often about Nikola Jokic and about Russell Westbrook and their vision and ability to see plays develop but Aaron Gordon having Klay Thompson on him taking advantage of that in a one-on-one situation nuggets get the lead back right here Strawther over to Russell Westbrook Westbrook in the lane tough shot off the glass no Dallas has it both teams trying to record their 23rd win of the Season Ms have 16 losses nuggets have 15 losses just ahead Thompson oh and Gafford in the lane missed it challenge wow no harm no foul no blood no foul Gordon for three Westbrook after it and it'll be Dallas basketball wow a lot of contact on that last I was going to say the exact same thing that was Gafford had the dunk I believe initially and spun out of it the Nuggets were trying to scramble some big steps there and could not convert Grimes has come in Marshall Washington Thompson Dinwiddie and Grimes well Grimes waiting to come in excuse me dping in to Gafford Gafford collapsing on Gafford they take it away yeah hold on to it loose ball MBS have it three to shoot Thompson lets it go that's no good Westbrook's got it nuggets are down by one we've got five and a half to go Westbrook on the drive lay it up and in oh Westbrook tur it on the Jets and the Nuggets by one now 9796 head right down to the wire we got a nail biter here in Dallas now three is blocked pyton Watson got his hand on it 5 minutes to go give it to Jokic good idea out to Braun tend to shoot back to Jokic NBA's leading three-point shooter and he draws the foul they're going to call it on the ground still a foul it'll be nugget basketball defensively Peyton Watson is always flying around he gets a little piece of that one right there those are the type of efforts that you need in tight games and then Nikolaa Jokic feels how close G he's going straight up that looked like a jump shot to me I'm not an official however no 9796 nuggets going to screen and roll Porter five to shoot Jokic puts it up we going to call that on the floor oh my gosh what is the shooting motion so Jokic says I'm getting into the shooting motion but they're not going to give him that so that's two in a row hands in the cookie jar no that's absolutely going up so another 14 seconds on the clock Malone can't believe it remember those two plays if the Nuggets can't pull this out Crouch and defense Jokic has it Jokic against the smaller man Lively's patrolling Jokic is in the lanee around the corner and he drops it home The Splendid Serbian more points and the nuggets with a three-point lead 9996 biggest lead of the afternoon for Denver now Porter and Denwood he draws the foul let's go back to Nikola yogas boy some of the tough shots he makes under dures being bumped smaller player on him so he knows he's going to keep attacking he kind of waiting for that double team but look at the way that he shoots over Lively underneath as well he knows there's a shot blocker lurking and times it perfectly I should mention too the improved three-point defense from the Denver Nuggets in the second half the Mavs were 10 of 15 from deep in the first half two of 15 in the second half so the nuggets have figured some things out terms of Defending from Deep have to keep that going going here in the final 4 minutes and 13 seconds meanwhile at the free throw line the Mavs are 18 of 24 iny makes one of two 9997 remember these two teams split the earlier two meetings in Denver to play again against Dallas right here on Tuesday night nuggets nursing the two-point lead under to Westbrook what a pass maybe even a better cut that's how you make a team pay for double team and no hesitation those two they're operating at a different level Westbrook got 17 10 and seven so he could be heading towards another triple double he's got the double double at the moment Dinwiddie pass it out laying it off loose ball nuggets come up with it Porters On The Run give it to Jokic Porter for three oh and they'll call a foul on Jokic here I think bumping Grimes out of bounds yeah going for that loose ball there Nikola Jokic is trying to deter and I believe that's Y is four so they say yeah fourth fourth team foul or fourth personal foul I should say fourth team foul so Jamal Murray comes back in Jokic needs help 10197 Denver Murray also operating with four fouls just over three minutes remaining in this one Nai Marshall oneon-one mono mono here Dinwiddie triple Drive come underneath lay it up and in I think maybe you got to back off him a little then use your length to influence the shot pton Watson too and your first step has to be a little bit quicker as well you can deter that shot take a step off and then be ready to move and push off kind of Frozen there now Murray dribbling two-man game Jokic has it Jokic in the lane spots the man Watson for three payday that's a huge three-point make for pton Watson too Nikola Jokic had four Mavs on him 10499 trying to answer back yogic goes and gets the rebound now out to Murray alyo to Porter and Porter puts it in wow what a risky pass by Jamal Murray and Porter grabs it and lays it in I went oh my gosh I don't think Jamal thought it was that risky you didn't think so no Jokic pushing the pace up the floor Murray saw Michael Porter Jr streaking in from the weak side nuggets off and running and they lead 10699 time now for a whole story presented by adet elf reminding us to never underestimate the human Spirit well there's the whole story right there triple doubles all time Westbrook Jokic Jason kid and Luka Doncic and they're all in the house this afternoon it's it's crazy when you think about how much basketball impact is within Striking Distance here in the American Airlines Center and this is our beautiful quad box where we're first time this season where you guys are seeing four different camera camera look of these four basketball greats that's so cool what I mean the amount of stats and production between those four of course Jason kit already in the Hall of Fame the other three are going into the Hall of Fame one day I'm Chris Marlo with Scott Hastings and Katie wiie the Nuggets putting on the rits here they were down 9694 with just uh 646 remaining and the nuggets have put together a 123 scoring run now can they keep getting stops defense is taken over here off the screen comes Thompson now Dinwiddie shaking that's not going in rebound available Watson's got it really good defense right there from the Denver Nuggets and flying around helping each other out all five on a string love what Watson is doing here getting late minutes crunch minutes and making it pay off now Jokic has it knocked away Murray says seven on the clock got to go five to shoot Murray over Lively Jokic was there Porter tapping no should run it out run some clock coach Marlo run some clock Murray's going to shoot a three Porter tip yes MP with a very short j a little Tipper there that is two beautiful offensive rebounds from Michael Porter Jr in moments that matter most it's a 14-3 run Washington drops one in finally the one9 to go nuggets by seven not quite out of the woods yet Westbrook 1710 and seven yage 19 16 and seven Jokic dump it under Westbrook there again wow they have brain waves are working here well Nikola Jokic is making it very easy on Russell Westbrook too because Westbrook has figured it out and he's got something to say to some of the fans over there he has figured it out has he I give the ball to Jokic then I run towards the basket he throws it to me I lay it in as easy as he I hang out there for a second because so much attention goes to Nikola Jokic as Jamal Murray misses that one but Michael Porter J the Dallas Mavericks just turning and ball watching and then Russell Westbrook down low inside it's it might not be upon the initial cut that Westbrook is open but if he hangs out long enough Jokic will find him the oldest play in basketball pass and cut the Nuggets defensively here in the second half particularly here in the fourth quarter it's been brilliant Scott Hastings you likeing some defense yeah here's here's the difference real fast and what they've been doing put Scott on camera I want to see what he's doing listen Jokic was is fabulous but the first half they were doubling right away he was trying to throw it out and the ball was getting deflected if you've noticed they're almost like delay little cuts and then passes and he's had three or four of them already and again he's flirting with another triple double I don't think they'll get it with 53 seconds 110 101 you look good on camera Scott I know you're a handsome man I'll give it back to you oh well well let's put this one where oh there you okay there you go there we are I've been hey now the producers get on I've been on it for like 20 minutes but he had the camera in front of his face to slow in there they chose not to show know I know we got a surprise for you though uh the post game wow Russell Westbrook with a rejection and Westbrook I don't know who he's chanting at out there but fans the everybody he said no no 50 seconds remaining the Nuggets by N Dinwiddie Out to Thompson for three he's wide open rattles out and Jokic collects the rebound now Nikola Jokic 17 rebounds to go with 19 points and eight assists he's heading for a somore double don't forget our next TV on altitude will be Wednesday night when the Rockets come to town the Rockets one the surprise teams in the NBA second in the west now Jokic around the corner dump it to Russ and he puts it away and the crowd what's left of it here in Dallas is stunned at the Nuggets late run here the final 13 seconds and the Denver Nuggets are going to go up two games to one in the series they're going to get a precious win on the road they will improve to 23 and 158 game games over 500 for the first time this year you said precious win and I think that's exactly correct this wasn't the prettiest of wins for the Denver Nuggets but they found a way so much credit to the second unit in the guys off the bench coming in setting the tone really providing some energy when it was a slow start
