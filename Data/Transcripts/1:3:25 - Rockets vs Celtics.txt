 but his winning percentage is the best all time here we go rockets and seiz by the fact that Jeff's 38 he's got a lot of life and a lot of basketball left in those legs yeah a mix up there and look like Sengun is guarding Aaron excuse me Jrue holiday we got Aaron there are guys I got to speak to Mama and Sean Papa before the game I'm assuming both guys will be on the floor opposite one another at some point here tonight Sengun on porzingis Vanessa will have more on the brothers meeting one another and Sengun Worlds the Turner on Flamingo he's two for two yeah that's a great sign because porzingis length really bothered Shimon the last time those two met up holiday it's not that Jrue can't score he's just so selfless that's what he does best is that defense right there he throws it up to porzingis and doesn't have to jump too high at 73 to dunk it down but Celtics get an easy to off the turnover Zone look here for the Celtics will face him and the jumper goes for Jeff he's off to a fantastic start yeah the veteran there's a reason that Jeff was thrown in and got to speak with him before the game and I said Jeff you know your star tonight right he was a little hesitant but I knew we'd always be prepared I got a chance to play with Jeff several times and one of those times over in Boston also that is our Verizon orbit cam whitmore they take more threes than anybody and white has just been awesome for them yeah that's their offense seventh in the league in made threes that was 118 for him now on the season is somehow someway Dillon Brooks gets it to go speaking to guys who have been awesome with their new team two years in a row for Dillon Brooks and he's on an offensive tear you see Sengun guarding holiday because he likes to post up and that's what he does he gets downhill Craig banked it up an in have thought that maybe Sengun size would deter Jrue holiday is a Relentless attacker of the rim although as his career has gone along that frequency of attacking the rim has dropped a tad bit but still very good and the holiday family some of the most respected people in the league yes and fet with a shot clock winding down pull back two offensive rebound Sengun went for it it was knocked out of bound by Tatum Rockets get it with 14 a set 14 on the 24 you mentioned it earli I'm just surprised that this Zone look and you know it's a backto back a little short-handed for the Celtics but Joe Mula coming out in zone second game of four game Road Trip for them won in Minnesota last night 118 115 down the Baseline Blowing by porzingis and Sengun stays perfect I'm telling you excellent sign for the rockets Sengun in attack mode and forced that double team to come and make the right play Boston won last night without brown and without porzingis he shot 22 of 57 for three only committed four turnovers that's a shockingly low number and another look after Sengun after porzingis almost had it and then just hit it with a spin move Ryan down the Baseline yeah that was is first that's what you have to do good job from out you got a smother porzingis he loves that mid-range post up and right the Shon deep post positioning porzingis could do nothing about it it's no question but again going right at porzingis make him work disrespect me with the one1 go ahead and Fry him and got fouled again and this time will be rewarded with a cou giant of Sengun to start this ball game for the Rockets that's the second already on porzingis don't miss out on the Monday mat initially had a career high six steals against the Mavs they readjusted the box score officially credited with five which tied his career high but he's been on fire and if you don't send two and three guys at him he's going to burn you yeah he is and again the strength that Alie put on the in the off season is really paid off for him to be able to hold his ground he already has eight Tatum fouled by Jeff was claiming that he gave him an elbow hadn't seen Jeff a lot but you know Jeff was the backup seok in his first year here in Houston and just hasn't been called upon as much but Jeff has a lot left in the tank there's no question yeah he played 78 games last year started six times has it again hasn't played any near anywhere near that amount of time as white makes his second three that they've got the green-light they they take those shots that other NBA teams May hesitate on and the Celtics let it rip from three that's their offense green thought about it now looks to take holiday off the dribble The Help by Tatum finds Brooks a little off balance in the corner and history goes down how good has Dillon Brooks been just shooting with confidence and love how quick that he's getting off his shot this year last four games coming in for Dillon Brooks averaging 249 and shooting better than 43% from three as VanVleet is down har still out the man Thompson serving the second game of his two game suspension as Luke Kornet checks in and dunks it down Kornet can play does he get a lot of action but they going to call upon his size against out Oh I thought that was almost in for green but again we talked about how he has a lot of life left in those legs we saw it there the Celtics bench is deep and dangerous holiday for three that's the game plan you know alred is going to be guarding uh Jrue holiday to force him to shoot not that he can't shoot but you know he likes to set up up the rest of his teammates Sengun on Court and spin move missed the shot though he came in because porzingis picked up two early fouls white will survey picked up by Green now gives it to Payton Pritchard who as of right now as the leader of the clubhouse the six stand of the Year holiday able to pull back and through holiday is hot to start his fourth make his second three he's got 10 and just like that eight straight by Boston four of five are the Celtics already from three they'll get up 50 plus tonight for the three-point line Jalen Green will drive po no man's land now to Brooks on holiday lows the shoulder too strong on the layup attempt Tatum back to him one-on-one with Sengun takes him off the dribble goes to Kornet from the dunker spot and he dunked it down on top of Sengun yeah back the back dunk for pouring that and normally he'll step out and shoot fre showing some power he's a he's a big boy too that Celtics had some huge bigs 12 straight appearance for Luke Kornet a season Ian believe for three the Rockets are going to have to make threes tonight they won a lot of games this year we talked about a lot about this lately they won a lot of games this year when they don't win the three-point map losing the three-point map to the Celtics is not a formula for success because they're going to get up 50 plus threes and odds are they're going to hit somewhere in the neighborhood of around 20 of them yeah rockets need to get something going here offensively they gone cold and a shot just inside the three-point line a two-point fi goal for Jalen green goes down his first points of the game of the Rockets first Basket in the last two and A2 minutes can't go through scoring drops against the Celtics they're second in league in offense they average almost 120 a game and this is what they do they take and they make three after three after three yeah the threes have been the difference but again man the Celtics just steep in confident it can go cold also so seen that happen before green weaving his elbow jumper good so two in a row for Jalen Green but the Rockets are currently exchanging Twos for threes that's the shot that's there with Kornet and they stay in such a deep drop Pritchard goes Baseline and then on the other side able to bank it up and in he's having an awesome season playing the best basketball of his career only Celtic to play in every one of their games this year now Boston they've been rather pedestrian since their hot start because they've been dealing with quite a few injuries to their rotation the guys who make up their rotation ton on Kornet rolling short so hit a lot of success early on porzingis not so much against Kornet holiday five of six 12 points just like and Aaron great pick cute looking kids world class family and two really good basketball players as Jalen Green ends up getting fouled by pcho by the way Jrue is 9 and 3 all time against Aaron yeah Jrue joke with me before the game and he said he doesn't want Aaron picking him up full court and could imagine there's a lot of Defense in the holiday household rockets need some offense Justin har a great defender too they can all defend VanVleet to Brooks who is open in and out Steven Adams in there gets the offensive rebound and he's able to score over Kornet there you go Steven Adams really doing a great job of late on the glass and Whitmore coming off the 18-point game is out there here in the first quarter about three minutes to go in the first Tatum a contested three that's what you got to do you got to get hands up missed it badly Kornet though the offensive rebound to Pritchard shot from the corner and he makes it they have so many good Shooters now their three-point field goal percentage this season is about is down about two percentage points from what it was a year ago but still with volume they get up so many and when they make them look out good job Whitmore to Adams missed the layup though and they try to get it back and lost it out of bounds and now it's time for a wing stop bringing the flavor and look when Mike Danton was the head coach of the Houston Rockets the Rockets were the first teams in NBA history to take more than half of their shots as threes as you see there the Celtics take better than 55% of their shots as three-pointers it's never been done before even by what the Rockets used to do which was a surprising thing for the league back then but the Celtics now basically 5 percentage points more on threes in terms of attempts of overall field goals than the Rockets ever did under MDA and you see the three-point discrepancy to start this game that's a big thing yeah it's a the new NBA Kornet misses and then Jalen Green knocked it out of bounds unfortunately see if the Rockets can get Pritchard air mails it white battling on the weak side for the rebound not I'm sorry it wasn't it wasn't Derrick white that's Jordan Walsh seconde player out of Arkansas scoreless last night couple of games ago had 10 points against the Raptors in career eye youngest guy on their wer at 20 years of age B lead and he knocks it down so going to need a lot more of that especially from him again he's been a lot better shooting the three here over the last couple of weeks but they're getting a big ball game for Fred VanVleet from the perimeter here tonight again that's a shot that our guards are going to get because the bigs are so deep in their drop for the Celtics Pirtchard on Brooks buried it 42% Pritchard from downtown this season he played with Dillon Brooks one season in Oregon you saw those two greet each other and Pritchard the Pack 12 player of the year he had quite the career spin move Tatum in to Adams blocked by Tate Tate gets it back Fred buring trying to find a lane comes back out to Brooks short on that three rebound picked up by Tate good energy from J Shan as always now cam Whitmore from the corner that was nice there you go a little three-point action here for the Rockets but they did the old fashion way hitting the glass now let's see if they can get a stop off the class Pritchard putting on a clinic he's gotten better he is falling this season it's just confidence you know he win a world championship and he played a huge part in that and he had a scoreless second half last night at Minnesota but you know he's a little bit more focused offensively to get that shot up and in here to begin this ball game as VanVleet Blows By him goes right to the rim and lays it up and in good energy from the Rockets starting to pick up on the offensive end but they've got to get some stops now Celtics are shooting 65% final second to the quarter Kornet to Walsh that would have counted they ended up making seven of their 12 the Rockets started the game off six of eight for the floor have since gone seven of 19 down six as cam Whitmore goes to Sengun as he's back on matched up with porzingis yeah you saw this in Boston you got n p on the floor and porzingis does not stop out pinching goon so unorthodox here Joe moua going with the huge 73 7-1 lineup Porzingis get back after missing the last four games with an ankle ISO his 12 game overall this season Rockets Come Away with a turnover Here Comes K let himself a little bit too much on the dribble which took him out of a dunk situation but he still got two and that's what counts it's now a two-point game there you go Rockets finally getting a stop there and super rockets can use their speed to their advantage and one more injury note on porzingis of course missed the start of the season coming off of offseason hook surgery as he shoots and misses now the Rockets can tie it with a two the lead back back with a three so the Rockets fall down by 10 twice early against Dallas and battle their way back they're on a 14 to5 run Jeff pass deflected Whitmore picks it shoots it missed it and foringas with the rebound Boston is a very good defensive rebounding team the Rockets are the best offensive rebounding team as that's been the case for most of the season in the league pulls himself all the way back out to the three-point line so sario here for the Rockets as they Trail by two now it's official Aaron Flor flipped it up over the top por zingas missed it those two on the floor at the same time and it's t a little too handsy picked up the foul on Jrue holiday can't leave wide open they came off of him for a moment and that's what he'll do to you his third three want to communicate that white averaging over 17 a game of career high wh more thought about it now dumps it into shun at the elbow White had 26 last night at Minnesota he draws two finds holiday shot clock winding down he got to take the shot here Aaron he does didn't grab any iron so that's a turn over in the shot clock violation thing you see Boston getting a lot of defle so you got to stay tight with your passes against the Celtics the Rockets are have some open looks but those deflections playing apart Austin does a great job they have for years staying in front of drivers very fundamentally sound are the Celtics white this time a really deep three and he bricked it badly not even close Whit more ahead of Team Co to ghost got it all missed the shot rebound holiday he'll come the other way to Pritchard comes Baseline got by Sengun and on the other side's able to make the reverse boy it's been white holiday and Pritchard for the Celtics and trying to do the math here what 33 of the Celtics points between those three guys as the rebound is cleared by holiday 12 a piece for Pritchard and holiday nine for white for zingis he hits the three so the Rockets had a couple of possessions ring to either tie or regain the lead they weren't able to do so and then you look up and you're down by 10 again yeah it's a three-point shooting and the Celtics they don't hesitate not at all jenon on holiday again draws a Crowd Goes Baseline bed it up then he's got 12 and that's pretty holiday is a all First Team Defender but cannot stand front of Sengun right there K right down the middle of the lane for the rim bender on the floor I don't know when the last time I've seen that in the NBA it's been a while that's for alred Sengun interesting Jrue holiday guarding Alperen he got help Sengun stays with it stays with it now needs some help threw up the shot but it ended up hitting along the Baseline Sengun wanted a foul there numbers forth coming Rockets give it back to the Celtics seven whites three of six and all those makes coming from the three-point line over the top to porzingis now to Queta missed the shot Rockets caught a break pretty good big to Big passing there though br line drive three rockets needed that his second triple needed that is right now let's see if the Rockets can pay it off and get another stop they were fortunate that last time Porzingis is going at it still going at it Queta spins off good and now there's going to be a whistle on a foul I believe on Dillon Brooks Yep they're going to hit him with his second as see porz zingas we're battling consistency with their shooting particularly their three-point shooting Bost when they got it going got the full package and that's why they're the defending champs and now it is Sengun who gets porzingis his first yeah tough foul but you like the physical play from aling green back out there match up with white came under the pick so white shot the three missed it that's why they don't turn it over if they get open look they let it fly working a t him now can't turn the corner goes inside to Sengun working on that left block back to Green Hill launch over Tatum a deep three good there you go nice little two man game between Jalen green and and talk about how willing a shooter out passer that Alperen is Chin's been incredible blocks the shot they're going to call a Goen though on another drive by Pritchard who's just been eating the Rockets up off the dribble angle he's going to take it he's done that this whole game Pritchard has 14 he's outscored the entire Rockets bench in fact he's the leading scorer in this game green with a toe on the line jumper goes down that his fourth in seven shot and again good to see the Rockets offense firing but now they got to get some stops just so tough to defend there Bost team and they Str out well Alperen should be able to Zone up right now there you go but they get the ball back Queta to White the reset the drive the kick the Deep straightaway three porzingis no another offensive rebound to White lets it Fly oh my goodness yeah that's that's what's tough man those threes create long rebounds and it's unorthodox you there's nobody else that that shoots as as quick quicker threes as a as a group you know Golden State used to let it fly now it's just Curry lets it rip like that but everybody one5 green feeling it comes around the pick and makes his third in a row that one he was beyond the three-point line he's got 12 just like that there you go again the Rockets offense is rolling they just got to get a stop inside of five to go in the first half been a really fun first half Tatum the Queta to white but of a bad pass he gets it back shoots it dances off holiday gets it ahead to Green he'll attack against three Defenders now dishes it to Whitmore shoots three and then Brooks went for the board I think went drop eight points of green in the quarter a couple of Threes then that long two with the toe on the three-point line got Whitmore Fring porzingis Pritchard to Queta Dives down the lane misses at The Rim but a foul is going to be called Jalen Green does not feel like he fouled him thinks that Queta just missed this dunk but maybe the foul was low first on green K to the line and now a message from Alliance in the league and the rockets are the best free throw defense in the NBA I must say wink wink see you making things happen see there we go last down now the Rockets have been Elite on free throw defense for two years running I'm not saying I have anything to do with it but I'm saying I have something to do with it second last year best free throw defense in the League this season did you pull that stat up man did I look it up myself did earlier today when was researching and preparing for the game while you were lounging and sipping on iced tea yes yes I was yes I did Brooks on Queta into the lane slips by him out stretches missed it Whit more came for the weak side tried to dunk it back and it went off of Boston second time the Rockets nearly got a put back dunk earlier it was Jeff but good activity and the huge lineups on the floor man for Joe moua yeah they got they got some Big D dud Kate has been really good for them Kornet as you mentioned earlier has had an outstanding season is really unheralded underappreciated for what he brings to this Boston team Jeff will shoot and he will score Jeff getting the start in place for the injured Jabari Smith Jr if you're just joining the Rockets the thing we kept hearing about his time in Boston was that his honesty and transparency with his players was crucial to that Celtics team success oh there's no question about it guys like Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum hold him in high high regard he's a tough L guy he's a great coach I like the fact that he allows his players to speak their minds of course he speaks it right back to them but he is a leader of men and he has led the Rockets back into being part been a perfect marriage between the young players the added veterans in Brooks and VanVleet prior to last season in this new coaching staff two-point game Jalen Green can give the rocket the lead that was not close picked out of there by Tatum is that the the the Kornet contest as he that's a Jalen Green contest yes it is Whitmore hops lean step through one on Three forced that one up missed it yeah I thought he had Dillon Brooks on the wing there and Tatum Gets behind the rock his defense he's two for seven so he's been relatively quiet he had a big game last night in Minnesota at 33 points8 rebounds not assist and three steals green stumbling puts on the brakes thrs up a wild shot cleared by Kornet so the last three possession by the Rockets not great over the top into corette in one motion threw it up got pushed and Kornet will go to the free throw L if you're wondering this game and Kornet will step as Jeff picks up this second and guess what it is full time for the second consecutive season pbr's premier I'm I'm waiting you told me I need to work on my core strength I've been working on my core strength trying to get ready for when and or if forearm ready mechanical bull shows up Kornet gets it back missed the shot Rockets Come Away with it and then a collision and a blocking foul on white as both guys ended up on their Keers is this a clear path violation foul in the back court they sent two on Tatum get by the two gets to the rim and gets denied at the cup Uncle Jeff with the block how good has he been in this first half Sengun no stays with it can't come away with it just got to go power up there once you get that much space porzingis rip through move on Jeff picks up the foul now and we're going to take a look at that last def that's why Fred is attempting just the third free throw of the game for the Rockets now the Celtics don't foul much for the second year in a row as he makes their free throw they allow the fewest free throw attempts per game to opposing teams and conversation about the Lakers free throw discrepancy versus their opponents over the last couple of years it is sizable well they're a team that does get downhill and LeBron and Anthony Davis forced contact by their style of play but it's always going to be controversy around LeBron James you'd imagine say porzingis fourth pick of the 2015 draft now at his ninth year last time he scored 30 points on the road he had a 32-point game last January right here against the rockets on the free throw L sh open like a free throw 14 that's exactly what it was old man he doesn't get his backyard as that man footed free throw jumper that was old man in Chuck Taylor's hoops right there he an uncle somewhere proud an uncle he'll be killing the youngest too Tatum again man and day hunt threes second three and you've got to follow through with your contest against the Celtics air 11 of 22 from the three-point line they've cooled off somewhat though VanVleet the Sengun into the lane knocked out of his hands off the Kornet pick long three two in a row for Tatum you got to be up and that's a shot he can hit in his sleep and everybody knows Jayson Tatum's Talent Green right to the rim got fouled a two for one 27.3 to go in the half this isari missing another game and then Thompson will be back on Sunday there's look at Jabari man think about the Poke he hat in the eye and times he's Hit the Floor Jabari very durable but just get hit in the wrong spot your hand man that can it happens a lot this is a match up against this team in particular you really miss the ter Ryan don't you oh man it'si long athletic switchable Defenders who can close out on three-point Shooters this match up is an ideal for one for that that was an ideal move by Jayson Tatum weaving through a couple of rockets Defenders have to two threes and then dunking it down closing second to the half green runs it up up short at the horn and that'll do it Boston up 65 14 and the third quarter gets underway with a wing three by Brooks over porzingis that misses forette starting there the huge up is out here Joe moula going throwback NBA so he gets the the start in place of Hauser for the Celtics in this second half green all over tat a score the last eight points of the second quarter for Boston and forces him into an air ball great def from Jalen Green you you saw Jayson Tatum just working for a bucket and Jaylen said not on me but Boston on brand in that first half offense coming in the paint offense coming from threes and just one turnover that's what they do we had a whistle and a foul off the ball on Alperen Sengun all the contact in the game this game and you call that seemed irrelevant to play oh yeah the hook ah I don't like that call he's getting position a little B much there Austin Swift used it last year they won seven of the last eight overall got to crowd him yep you had a little bit of a mouse in the house there on porzingis and VanVleet fouled him and will send porzingis to the line he's two for two again very few free throw attempts taken by either team so far in this game porzingis is at 85% in his limited time this season due to some injuries and recovery from foot surgery makes the first and now work from caram injury lawyers ability as we've seen already in this game with all that size to throw a wave of big guys at you around the rim and they can protect the rim at an elite level Chris STS is huge he's a unique big for his shooting and shot blocking and there goes Jalen Green so green now with 16 but again look how deep The Bigs are for the Celtics they can't get up and match Jalen's foot speed tum one Jalen green comes into the lane comes inside to Kornet he was lived at that dunker spot got to watch that push off there from Tatum you call that both ways you call Sengun for his post up call Jaylen Brown Excuse me T Jayson Tatum for his push off Celtics up double digits again green lines up to three makes it third three for him here you go underhanded rockets and spirited basketball from Jalen Green over the top and too much over the top holiday to porzingis a very rare Boston turnover last year Boston won 6 game screen stay oh it does not stay hot missed that one he wanted to stay hot a little bit of a heat check shot there but last year Boston 64 and 18 beat Miami in five games in the first round beat the the Cavs in five in the Eastern Conference semis and the rockets come up with the turnover then Dillon Brooks gets to the rim has it stuck by white who's probably the best shot blocking guard in the entire league huge part of the Celtics Championship last season plays like that he does he does not give up on plays on either end 4-1 over Miami 4-1 over Cleveland as Tatum gets fouled swept the Pacers in the Easter Conference Finals will then beat the Mavs four games to one of the NBA Finals yeah there goes Jalen Green getting to a spot and he understands valuable he is to the Celtics third on Brooks take advantage of tonight's rocket shop online item of the game to four appearances in the finals and championships most recently in ' 08 in last year green gets it back gets doubled Jun got to go out of am B goes Baseline at a step on porzingis now to Jeff was out of bounds he a step back out of heel on the line and gives it back to the Celtics Rockets way too casual in that set offensively white the runner he's got 14 Boston's biggest lead they've matched it at 11 chenon was a focal point early hasn't done a ton of stuff offensively since sets the pick for Green Drop oh vience so awesome we just talked about those bigs getting up for the Celtics and they don't have a chance to stay in front the love and that answerers with another dunk double fist pum by Kornet he's a he's a character man he's a fun guy into Sengun in the lane spin kick shot no yeah that double big lineup Joe mulich just converging too Green's got 21 Kornet sets the pick Tatum comes up firing too strong got to get the rebound Sengun does comes into the front Court leads the charge uh oh mtim his steps a little bit initially wanted to go to Jeff they're going to call for a walk good job you see you notice that Rockets got to pick their eyes up the ball's in bounds yeah Boston wasted very little time broken up by Sengun yeah but you see the Celtics scoring or getting fouled on their opportunities the Rockets kind of got to finish those plays there can't come up empty-handed shooting they're daring him to into the lane Jeff foul so some rare fre thros coming up for the Rockets the first two for Jeff again getting the start in place of the injured Jabari Smith Jr who fractured his hand and shoot around today 758 730 to speak to our team for details on locations and pricing for more information head to rockets.com he bragged about the Rocket's depth and Jeff it's played sparingly and you see how good he's been here tonight now we'll see how ultimately this affects him when he starts to play on the regular but certainly definitely enough athleticism and skill in his body at 38 years of age to get the job done Celtics almost turn it over but there was a foul called on Houston it's going to be on Dillon Brooks and successful but he's been awesome with the Rockets as porzingis has called for a walk after play has resumed and they threw it over the top this no you got it that was the most surprising thing when he came here I'm like wow he is so soft spoken very unassuming kind of like Clark Kent and then an evil Superman when he starts playing Green draws a crowd fires it a corner long two rebound white he'll push ahead to Tatum in on VanVleet back to White Sengun there to turn him back he'll shoot for three man what they do this fifth I feel like they just stole him when they picked him up they did San Antonio let him go and just is's the perfect piece because he he does what you ask and great two-way guy great defender great shooter doesn't care if he gets a shot that's why he was part of Team USA in fact they played him over Tatum that was the whole controversy got to shoot it go the three Off the Mark and out Rockets keep getting in these red situations where they have to lead here at 12 still a manageable deficit but with the way Boston shoots the ball you he the Rockets got to be real careful here they've been down multiple times by double figures they've got right back at a game can't let things get much further out of hand it's probably easiest shot Derrick White seen all night long he misses Shadows green into the lane the dis to Sengun draws two to7 Footers and they when dp's there they're like kick it out for three we don't care they are converging Tatum his three every time Tatum drives he pushes off every single time that's got to be called that pass Sten Away by Tatum comes back out to Holiday he misses offensive rebound porzingis right back to him Works Baseline on the other side Sengun got a piece of it scooped up by Kornet and he's called for a walk after being sworn by multiple red jerseys yeah Tate comes in Tate is back out there man Fleet to Tate to Whitmore great look rich a great first half with 14 points works on VanVleet comes back across to Hauser who was in their starting lineup his four star in the last five games holiday's missed time Browns missed another game that's the why he was in there broken up by Whitmore scooped up by Green Celtics now starting to turn the ball over a little bit in this quarter had just one of the first half six in the third and then they pressure green somehow was able to get it ball back to Whitmore now pressured by Hauser to take the lead Celtics really extending their defense into Tate rumbling inside throws a back out to Jeff keep his balance to B Lee resets kicks on the skip Jalen Green three no good and the rebound eventually to Hauser of the Celtics rocket Working Man Celtics are making the rockets work and got to get some easier looks holiday that time got green off his feet and Jalen's call for the foul a little frustrated since a hot start but they have so many guys who can put the ball in the hole and now a word for Mattress fur Court said that there was going to be two seven Footers on the floor at the same time but the the big focus is from Joe Missoula I'm not going to let Sengun beat me you know he somebody else is going to have to beat me he's going to have to see two seven Footers yeah that's been very obvious since Sengun started the game so well got a foul on Boston it's going to be on uh Nish Queta first Portuguese player ever to be drafted was the 39th pick of the 2021 draft by the Kings we got a timeout starts to the Celtics will'll take it with him pass there from Steven Tatum oh gosh loses Whitmore tumbles down shoots for three makes the three he pushes off every time man he pushes off every single time you got to make that call Whitmore from the Baseline overshoots the rim Tate got a hand on it stays with it keeps it alive back to Whitmore now to Adams then ble one one with Pritchard shoots a deep two misses it Adams battling for the board out muscles Queta throws it up no stays with it and eventually got the foul good minutes from Stephen Adams second on Queta Adams makes the free throw Jalen Green right back in VanVleet going out perfect trip for Adams who came in at just 37% of the line again he's been good for a month maybe we'll see some Steven Adams and chinon at the same time that's a big lineup he's out defending Tatum on the perimeter there's the help by holiday Queta dug out by Pritchard on the short hop now to Hauser good energy more from the wing he's wide open too strong Adams battling and eventually comes down to Hauser and the Celtics good energy since taton Adams have checked in Tatum going ISO here on Jalen Green got to be ready ISO and Jayson Tatum place oh no and call him for a walk and got crushed by jop just Alexander ISO more frequently than do Jayson Tatum again that's why the Rockets could really use one of if not both of a man Thompson and tar e for this particular matchup green off balance from the corner stays hot for three 24 points for him 10 in the third after scoring 10 in the second similar shot that we saw Jalen hit early and again the BX they're so deep for the Celtics that play is going to be there here rocket down 10 Tatum again isoing over the top to Queta Rocket swarm him falls down loses it out of bounds Houston ball eight turnovers by the Celtics in the third quarter from a Rockets perspective you you kind of hope that the Rockets were to take a little bit more advantage of those turnovers than they have they unfortunately have not the Rockets have only scored five points off of the Celtics turnover in the quarter seven overall in the game and the rocket normally make teams pay when you turn it over around and out offensive rebound Tate working on Queta and Tatum and there's a whistle and a foul and I think Tate is I don't think he holiday doing the honors comes into Tate back to green again draws the crowd now one-onone with holiday po come out and set that high pick Green does not take it rises up for a really really really tough shot they got a piece of it had no prayer of going in and now the shot clock is off himself can take the final shot of this third quarter as Adams again defending Tatum on the perimeter tries to lose him Adams blankets him misses the three and that'll do it up that defense from Steven Adams Yeah couple of times on the here tonight especally in this second half Boston has gotten turnover prone late help by porzingis Sengun misses as he tried to drive on Kornet prit back to Kornet now to Porzingis straightaway three his second he's got 11 points now it's a part of that unicorn nickname see how great he shoots and such a quick Rel how big he is yeah holiday into the lane go back try to go back to Tate had it deflected and stolen now the foul line for porzingis into Kornet blocked by Sengun but fouled got him with the body fourth on Sengun Kornet to line Kornet's had a really nice night tonight eight points and seven rebounds a couple of assists and it's full time again this is the second time we're reading this one for the second consecutive season PBR we have an update okay we have an update Grant M on Twitter says Craig I have a mechanical bow let's get something in the work yeah he did offer you bring that to Toyota Center we making Craig ride it uh you're my booking agent Whit more missed the layup and then Tate picks up the foul just reach out to Vanessa she's she's my booking agent our Guy Brian even knew about it pregame yeah Brian scalini was talking about it so this is a well-known thing across the league the Craig started a story about an alleged bull finished by saying he had never ridden the mechanical bull but we will make it happen all right looking forward to it 14-point Boston lead their biggest tonight has been 16 white fouled by green and now Derrick s uh nine of tonight so Green's got three foul I'm really good at this will be an empty trip but it's bricks for burgers everybody gets a free Water Burger y one for two back to a 15-point game though on the Rockets are running out of real estate yeah Rockets have to finish the open looks that they're they're getting another look at our Verizon orbit cam they're not leaving sh go not that's what that's what they're forcing and he got that open look but holiday misfired here's saying when he spins and we help we don't care about the kick out for those three-pointers Rockets are just two of 12 from three and the half down to 29% for the game N9 of 31 from three meanwhile Boston 15 of 32 from three porzingis with the catch the fouine jumper the rebound to Kornet comes back out to White and he sticks it ter white just filling it up six threes now for him 21 points in lead Boston in scoring and the rocket staring now at an 18 point deficit but again that's Boston's offense so they don't mind taking two and three threes to your twos because they know they can get stops still no points for Sengun in this second half again the LM of Kornet has bothered him and Kornet's all the you know seven 172 Celtics moved the ball well Kornet gets another offensive rebound pitard lines one up and makes it they miss they get offensive rebounds those offensive rebounds lead to kick back threes kick out threes and they just keep making them and now the Rockets are in a world to hurt down by 21 points as they call a time just 24 pain points for the Rockets tonight that is it and of course porzingis Queta and Kornet have taken Sengun out of the game it's his great start especially since they went to that double big lineup Rooks had it blocked well they just keep bomi in threes when a range of four is especially M poing threes well we don't hesitate again that is the Celtics offense to hook those early threes that one bounces over the top of the backboard Boston takes over 50 again that was just their just there that was the 36th attempt normal three-point Pace they are shooting 47% from three the Rockets are only shooting nine of 32 from three after that Miss so again the Rockets have won a lot of games they year when they have not won the three-point map again I talked about this at nauseum but this is one team that it's probably not going to work in your favor again well the offensive rebounds have been there sometimes when the three ball has it but this huge lineup they're just they're just packed in the pain pull back 20 fo2 yeah there's nothing Kornet could do it that one good move by VanVleet bit of a small lineup here going to attempt to switch everything for the Rockets green match up with white goes over the top to Kornet and he is El and it's going to be five on Dillon Brooks there's Queta yeah checking in go out got get credit though to Joe mou made that adjustment and it's worked it's worked really well did it in in the last match up and what the respect he has for out Sengun white able to finish white just does whatever's ass of him another one of those guys that just does not get enough credit G greens pull that three is good so he's made 5 threes he's got 27 points pretty shot there from Jalen Rangers backed up Jayson Tatum Tatum top of the circle TR gets to the rim he kind of picked up the ball and just ran with so he's got 20 he was pretty quiet to start the game offensively but got hot late second quarter scored the last eight points in the first half for the Celtics Brook little face up and Brooks knocks it down he's got 10 Rockets are shooting 38% from the floor the Celtics and even 50% from the floor and Queta able to take it away from Green who had him boxed out yeah the the length of the Celtics is really frustrated Houston in inside green blanketed Tay missed it another box out green on Queta but they don't come away with the ball and beating the rockets at their own game offensive rebounding yeah that's where you miss a men Thompson and T deep three Pritchard when you give them that many chances to score they're going to score timeout Houston CH landel out there too Celtics going deeper into their bench as well for the final four and change J Brown missing this one now Horford sitting it out due to rest this Celtics team is loaded on the second night of a back to back and the rockets don't get a shot off in time yeah that's what you've seen a lot of is the Rockets not being able to get a shot off they've had to play deep into the clock because of the size of the Celtics brck comes around the Xavier Tillman pit Drew Peterson out there as well skip it across the wall she got some out of the first half threw it away Whit more the pull up three he's just three of 15 in this game Rockets get it back Dam to get through two guys there right in the middle of that lane unable to do so went out of bounds let's touch by ball Pritchard comes out Jaden Springer comes in Rockets had to get up a shot in a hurry K would clear pretty impressive stuff here from the Celtics second out of a back to back again they have not been at their best over the last month pretty pedestrian record-wise N9 and six based on their team and expectations that's an offensive foul moving screen Rockets get the ball back after they got off that 16 and three start but they went into Minneapolis last night beat the Timberwolves without brown and porzingis and got in late last night that's not an easy back to- back coming in or going to Minneapolis they got in late went to bed l late and pretty much have dominated this game here tonight the Rockets are underhanded and joua said Al shun is not going to beat me you know Alperen got off to a quick start and he said no we're going to keep 71 and 73 in front of you at all times call Holiday for the foul career of Houston Chronicle Rockets beat writer Jonathan Fagan will also tell you about the clutch City foundation's inaugural scholarship recipients Kevin and Calvin look back at one of Calvin's many record setting nights all that and more on Rockets all access tonight after the postgame show all right Vanessa now and Vanessa here in just a little bit she'll be hosting the uh postgame show with the Hall of Famer kvin Murphy must see TV right there and that pass by Sheppard ends up going out of bound what if memory serves that that and there's a look at Sam Cassell Rockets Legend yeah Rockets Legend two-time Champion walked into the league walked into that Championship group and was awesome was the closer Kenny Smith the starter Sam Cassel was the closer going to be a head coach yeah a lot of people feel like he is long long overdue to get a head coaching job yeah he he certainly paid his dues there's no question about that's the play that the Rockets would have had to make all night long to win this game drive and kick and you know hit those contested threes just 26 pain points for rockets and now 10 of 36 for three oh they could all shoot yeah Drew Peterson second year out of USC actually started his college career at Rice we got a foul on Springer with two minutes to go in the game Rockets will put the wraps all here cover starting at Rockets a couple of really frustrating losses in Minnesota in Miami to start off the home stand took care of business against the Mavericks and Celtics taking care of business tonight Boston the second game of a four game Road Trip themselves couple of Hoops Peterson an orthodox move there hadn't seen that one before two time all Pack 12 guy Southern count apparently he chose the right School unfortunately feel bad for him got a much better educ USC than the every wood at UCLA landale stays with it and got F USC I know is University of South Carolina Craig what you talking about and speaking of Calvin and Vanessa stay tuned for the rocket post game show Rockets after this home stand concludes on Sunday we're going to be on the road a lot I think after this home stand the rocket play like 14 of 18 on the road got a road trip coming up this next week in Washington then to Memphis then to Atlanta Celtics about to get their fourth win in their last five season powerful dunk by Queta no this is unfortunately for the Rockets to get hit with the entry bug and suspensions this is the toughest stretch you can arguably say that the Rockets have seen wh more then you think back to that Minnesota game why it was the frustration letting that lead go because you knew these were going to be tough games ahead Miami and Boston here and then Lakers coming up can't get off the shot stripped and stolen by Sheppard closing seconds of the game bounce past Whitmore fouled with 13.1 to go far too many Boston fans here from my liking they're going to beat us from the perimeter we yeah a mid-range Jumper in the three-point shot or shots that were there all night for Jalen Green the focus was to take the away Al chinon just 32 half points for the Rockets as the Celtics winded down and beat
