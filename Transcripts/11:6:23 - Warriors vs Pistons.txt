 of him shooting in warm-ups George to miss a shot I kept waiting how good Steph Curry is truly blessed works hard yeah tler Ford Sean Corbin and ET Wang are the officials and Ausar knows how to get to the basket shows you right there now Steph Curry will work against Killian Looney guarded by Bagley Draymond guarded by be2 Steph Curry fires fills it in his face nearly hit him right there hand up and everything did not matter three to2 thanks to the triple for curry Cade in the lane doubles on the up bake bounces Killian into the corner be two fires for three and it's through it is so important that if you have an outside shot that you put that thing down tonight and force Golden State to have to come out and guard and not allow them to just camp out in the painted area Looney dishes to Klay shot off the rim Killian with a rebound here he comes to four Court pistons in their Classic Home White behind the back bounce to beef stew straight on gun go for Isaiah Stewart that's what I'm talking about you've got Looney playing in in the paint about 5et away from Isaiah Stewart he gets the quick Five Points shooting the ball wide open green l gives it up to Steph Curry Draymond Green the pride of Sagen a high on Michigan state Wiggins with a bad looking Miss boarded by Isaiah Stewart CH will try to run if they can tonight Golden State's a half court team these days Cade gives it up to Marvin Begley plenty of shot clock it's a 10 klian into the lane klian Rises and fires and fills it he rattled it in and the Pistons are up nine to three on a back to back so are the Warriors The Warriors lost in Cleveland last night their first road loss of the Season death Curry nearly made that crazy shot Warriors after the foul working on 14 second shot clock Steph Curry top side gunning it goes Curry wow two threes and six points for Steph Curry and the Warriors the average is 30 as most of you know Ausar back on play Ausar turning firing and missing rebound Draymond Green Green whips it to Wiggins lost it on the Baseline Cade was there playing of D there's c cerr one of the best ever guy has a ton of rings and such a classy guy Marvin Begley looking at the shot clock and says two he better shoot it he does and drills it that's a good sign the Pistons look like they're energized and assertive and aggressive let me tell you what else is a good sign Pistons have a three-point lead four guys have scored and the only guy that hasn't scored is Cade Cunningham who you know will score I like the fact that they've got balance so far and I hope they can hold on to that play Ausar with his first scratch makes it 118 Pistons eight 24 to play in the first Bagley screens Cade drives lost it Wiggins ahead for stth curry quickly to the basket nice job on the drive by Curry think of it only as a three-point shooter that was athletic and intuitive and smart did it with his off hand George you're right he he is as good inside the paint and in that lane at finishing as he is outside the outside the lane Jillian from outside stretches the lead to 14- 10 and the home team here the Golden State Warriors in town against the Pistons in downtown Detroit Steph Curry made that layup on Killian Hayes Killian ha went right back at him on the other end good for Kil greymond against Stewart shovels it to Klay in front to Looney put it down he may lose it he does Killian the four court it's a five on three break here yeah Pistons have some numbers Killian down deep to Marvin Bagley and they slap it away Rond green to four Court bounce to Klay Klay shot won't fall Cade with a rebound up and down action so far in this one g to the basket runs it up off the square and scores and now they've all scored five minutes in here at Little Caesar's Arena Andrew Wiggins topside bouncing aloney hands to Steph Curry wide open three short with this one rebound though to Draymond Green Klay to the basket lays it up lays it in it's got to be a very difficult feeling to have Steph Curry miss a shot and you don't defensive rebound that thing he do miss too many these two for three and it's through very confident with the long gun so far in this one the Pistons overall have two threes and n man has them both they're shooting 80% right now Jeff Curry misses from the lane lapped outside Klay as Ausar on him heads to the Baseline stops fires fills it up well they've got backto back Second Chance points off Steph Curry misses and George the only thing I can think is that you know everybody expects the shot to go in when Curry takes it and maybe you relax a little bit on your defensive uh rebounding effort even though he's great you got to expect him to miss it Bagley runs up the hook and he took an extra step trying the other piston rookie Marvin Bagley Cade Cunningham and Isaiah Stewart for the home team Dario Saric is checked in for Golden State Warriors went inside unable to hang up Moody will check in for them in a minute the third year man from Arkansas Gary Payton the second is in the ball game as well and the Warriors get a steal Payton slick it away on the drive Steph Curry acrobatic score George all time great point guard theg game plan missed free throw to Steph Curry right that one down Marvin Bagley top side to be St dribble hand off to Sasser jacks up a three is way long and out of bound Duren and Joe Harris out in this one Steph Curry for three though and it's through that's the equalizer for the Warriors he already has 13 and it's 19 all Cade Cunningham for three it popped out Chris to four court that great handle here's it up to Curry Curry over that one is splashed down he put on a show now un 10 straight points for the Warriors Curry has 16 already we have four to play in the first Sasser in the lane missing top side is Rhoden Chris PA gives it up to Curry yeah careful he'll hoist it from way back there I'm expecting a heat check from the lane FS it up off the heel leaping rebound to Moody and Moses Moody back up and in off glass Moody's going to always go to that offensive glass because that's his play call they're not going to call plays for him on the floor but he can get to that offensive glass he can make his own play call 12 nothing running a steal for the Warriors Payton usually makes the steal on the receiving end James wisman against sorry wisman with a shot rims off Miss Chris with a rebound called two times along the Baseline take a Time AG manager and Joe Aon keeping track of the numbers and so far the numbers have looked great for Golden State bris Chris gets a screen from sarich on Killian Saric from the top it's going to come up short off the floor to Sasser Sean Corbin the veteran official feel like they' walked in the middle of a storm that's the truth isn't it Chris cross towards to Moody Moses Moody from the paint flips it up no leaping rebound Stanley am Moody got Moody and a moody klian goes behind the back and Moody drives it double clutch is short trying to follow it up and he is fouled they call the NBA Cup first action at LCA November 10th against the 76ers that would be this Friday secure your spot at pistons.com tickets Jared Rhoden out of SE Hall buries them both play well for Motor City Cru last year cuts into that lead it's now five-point Advantage for the war Chris with the bounce of Saric top side of Moody Chris against

lost it wisan comes up with it to Stanley Umude just a minute to play in the first added Away by Payton Chris stops and fires ands it you can't give him that spot if you allow him to drive it right to that top of the key area 2824 Golden State final minute first quarter here at Little Caesar arena in downtown Detroit dillian starts a drive the control of the game needed to slow Golden State which was running downhill for a l 26 28 point mark and the pists are right there in their back door I say this not as good when Curry is not in the game first B from the corner launches and connects a triple and Chris who's been a cold shooter so far in a short stit with the Warriors is heated up here it's 3126 Golden State 20 seconds to play in the first Killian rocks that dribble Umude with a long three in and out rebound to Chris six seconds to play in the quarter 5 Seconds now four call clock at two oh for two though this has made him pass it Willian Hayes driving sets up wisan look like

quarter in downtown Detroit marus sass time for the three and that one is through this is game from way behind good to stay Within Reach of these Golden State Warriors especially Steph Curry is off the floor dominga topside shot won't fall chars with a rebound outside to Klay open fires no rebound Isaiah Stewart Sasser to four Court Sasser thought about it gave it up to Ausar back to Marcus Sasser and the two-point gun will go that shortens it up to a two-point game 10 and 24 to play here in the first half Saric screens for Chris Klay fires topside W ball charg for the rebound Chris against Ausar Kuminga against Killian basket cut for Chris kick ball called by Shan Corbin on James wisman out of that good for Golden State they're fortunate to keep this basketball you're right play to superar he's got time for the three and it's true they like his ability from distance and you got to like his size that he will pass the ball 610 and about 259 Killian get Chris behind him fires fills it up Killian's had a strong game he sure has I mean he has been into at both ends he's Tak it on the defensive challenge all the time still being offensively assertive yeah 9.5 dimes for Killian Klay hits to the Elbow sends it scores it he can still put it on the floor and get his own when he needs to you know you think of Klay you think of spot up and coming off stream Isaiah Stewart LIF to Marcus Sasser screens for him Sasser launches and misses and it goes up over the glass and five four five dillian leads the Pistons with nine fall to four court for Golden State Klay from the lane off that one foot fires fills it Klay with 10 and he's six out of nine wisman in the basket double cut miss out of bounds for Golden State I think uh Wiseman’s last jumper which wasn't favored by Lonnie Williams is the reason why he put that on the floor and tried to score on the interior not a bad move George but I'd like to see him go in a little harder with the eyes on dunking that thing 71 yep PA with a Miss on the Golden State end wisman screams for Cade who sends it and scores it under control the whole time paying off for Cade Cunningham Chris against Killian Hayes Klay against Cade Cunningham starts with a screen bounce pass it in the paint gets away scooped up by Beast stew Cade outside to Killian to Ausar mid post Decay topside Killian this the three will not go through sge for the rebound 7 and 45 to play in the first Golden State leads by five 40 to35 Chris FES the pass sticks the shot a mro there then most of you knew that already 4235 Golden State Beast d three for the long gun it goes can't dare that man to do that no respect knocked in another three he's got five out of six now the Pistons wanted to keep him playing inside that Arc but George they have not done that yet you know to make him play inside the arc you got to be in his in his jersey with him and and you're going to get beat off the dribble but you'll take your chances with that as opposed to letting him just ring it up from behind the arc he's got 19 points get beaten off the dribble but You' rather have him inside the three-point line no question about that here he is for another three this one's off the heel Cade with the rebound Cade Cunningham to Marcus Sasser Sasser against Moses Moody Cade Cunningham from the wing with a three of his own it's off the rim to Draymond Green

part of Ausar who had an open shot when he came off the screen but he dropped it down to uh Kevon Looney keep him involved keep him pay him off for some of those screens he's been setting PA worked hard to get that shot but he did score it he has seven 54 to 43 Golden State a minute and 50 to play in the half Sasser trying to guard Wiggins up and over over in those Wiggins and he put up a couple of free throws miss the first this year you know he missed a lot of time for you know personal reasons various reasons he missed a lot of time when he finally got back he was not the same in the playoffs and he's not the same yet this season hope for his sake if he does get out of that punk Ausar fires top side fills it up well he certainly looks better on his three-point shot last night and or yesterday afternoon and tonight Pistons within eight and they get a stop Rond green to the basket a little too hard off the glass Looney's there though to tap it in Pistons fought over it they fought each other and no one got it and Looney was right there to pick it up Cade gets a screen from Isaiah Stewart outside of Sasser he's not bashful but he gets to the Lane gets to the basket got

tonight and no Joe Harris out with injuries along with the other guys who Haven played all year yet hunningham with the shot nice splash down shot for Cade good to see him hit that one decent double figures early here in the second half and the Pistons are within five I thought it was important that they get that basket early and they did make this thing very competitive keep it within range you almost treat this like a road game stay close Steph Curry missed a three but on the other affirming himself for those offensive fouls Rond is his pocket pick Killian Hayes for a jam nice klian Hayes is really playing a pretty good game here tonight been the best piston on the court so far tonight I wouldn't argue that either big part of where the Piston of the big part of what offes are where
