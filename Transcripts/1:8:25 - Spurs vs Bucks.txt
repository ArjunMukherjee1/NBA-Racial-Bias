 couple of nights ago in Toronto the Spurs coming off a loss a couple of evenings ago in Chicago and a lot of fans with their phones out to get this jump ball they haven't seen Victor in person they're seeing something the likes they haven't seen before this is the first meeting between these two teams this year the last time they met was about a year ago on Wembanyama's birthday but Giannis and the Bucks spoil the party as we're going to get a whistle and a foul against Milwaukee actually no it's going to be a defensive 3 second violation so Chris Paul will go to the free throw line and shoot this shot he's a 98% free throw shooter on the season Milwaukee starting out with Giannis guarding Wembanyama and there was a switch and Andre Jackson Jr had to pick him up and wm's gotten a lot better about when he gets a mismatch of taking it down into the post and operating decisively when he gets down there A lot has been amazing about the number and the volume of Threes that he shoots but Mitch their interim head coach says they want to be creating an environment for him that doesn't stifle his creativity Castle getting creative he Out jumped Giannis and got the put back and he timed it out better than Giannis did that was an odd bounce but he timed it very very well I guess it's a little easier to time it out when your arms go forever Antetokounmpo probing turns it over to Vassell you know before the game Mark what you're just watching when Wembanyama touched the top of the backb I've never seen a player do that he is a unique breed one of one Mel on the probe had it blocked by Brook Lopez and it comes off to Lily lill coming off a good shooting night in Toronto a couple of nights ago where he had 25 Giannis against Harrison Barnes and Wembanyama put Giannis in the friend zone real early with that block Giannis excuse me Wembanyama might have caught his hand on something maybe even the rim going by to block that shot and just wiped it away jeez and that actually happened against Toronto to Giannis and a chase down block he cut his finger on the rim yeah had a couple stitches after the game here's Castle back the other way off the bucket by the Bucks a to to side for Castle drives it on Lillard help defense by Lopez and that's going to be a double dribble against the rookie out of UCON Castle is strong and athletic and can really drive the ball but you're right that was really good health defense by Brook Lopez Lopez setting the step up screen for Lillard and he can pick and pop off that Lillard Off the Mark with the three here's Wembanyama that onelegged three ball come on we said that he was unique there's some evidence but but not just that but he pulled up basically from the logo gave a shot fake and Andre Jackson Jr flew right by and he's got that shot credibility even from 27 ft always a threat Lopez put wama in the air and Jackson missed the alyu back comes Chris Paul Chris Paul was clutch he was excellent brilliant couple of nights ago down the stretch against Chicago finds Barnes and that one rims out yeah Chris Paul had 18 points in that game against Chicago and you're right down the stretch he was the only guy scoring for San Antonio so in transition Jay Castle gets matched up against Giannis and he draws the foul going to the rim let's go back to win Wembanyama shooting close to 36% now watch when he catches it just gives a shot fake and Andre Jackson Jr flies by and then he goes off Little Durk action there almost I mean that's ridiculous Wembanyama averaging just a shade under 26 per game 232 threes in his career about a year and a half into his career in that game against Chicago a couple nights ago he had 23 points 14 rebounds and eight block shots against the Bulls Ando Line Drive free throw short he's shooting about 61% from the stripe this year leads the the NBA in free throw attempts shoots over 11 per game you mentioned it earlier Jay number one in Fast Break points number one in points in the paint number one in transition points and don't you think this season he's played with an edge you can see it Doc Rivers challenged him in training camp to get back to that Defensive Player of the Year level of defense and he's responded in time here's Castle off the wide action finds him again and rebounded by Giannis Castle is not a great shooter yet he's shooting under 30% from three but he doesn't hesitate when he gets a good shot to put it up speaking of one-legged step backs Jay Giannis has it from the mid-range well he's been showing that all season long his mid-range shooting has really improved he's shooting 55% between 10 and 16 ft and that's going to be significant markk when we get to the playoffs because he's going to have to shoot a lot more those defenses are really going to load up on him in the playoffs there's Wembanyama firing from Deep Off the Mark rebounded by Chris Paul Barnes one more to castle castle probes he left that one on the front rim here's Damian Lillard Damian making that transition and the adjustment to playing without the ball a little bit more with the ball in giannis's hands here's Lopez got it but Brook Lopez has shot the ball so well especially of late that's 16 points against Toronto was four of eight they call them Splash Mountain they've got some really good nicknames on this yeah they do it's a good three-point Shooters when Wembanyama has that come off a lot of shooting this year around Giannis Lillard one of those guys Barnes switches on to him Giannis has the mismatch they double team it Damian left open that one halfway down and out and Vassell with the board and even opposite Brook Lopez was SP sh in up from about 25 ft here's Vassell knocks down the long jump shot Devon Vassell missed the first 21 games of the season coming off of a foot injury Vassell needed that one to go he hasn't been shooting the ball as well as he's capable of lately he three of his last 23 from three before that one leads the break Castle punched it home forced it in I'm not sure Lopez noticed that he made the dunk boy did he ever make it yeah it hit the rim and then he just forced it in he is super athletic and strong getting the start tonight in place of Jeremy Sochan so we see when Wembanyamama able to roam defensively as Lopez connects from Deep that's the difficulty though when you go and bring multiple Defenders at Giannis he's passing out and there are so many outstanding three-point Shooters and Brook Lopez in their game against Toronto hit his 1,3 of his career talk about a guy who's transformed his game completely from when he got to the lead to now it's started in Brooklyn under Kenny Atkinson here's Chris Paul back out to Wembanyama nice show and go raises up on y oh the circus is in Milwaukee tonight we are seeing a little bit of everything from Wembanyama not just Elite skill but Elite field game passed it back out got tipped into the back door shot clock is down to 10 Lopez has last scored the last six for the bucks Taurean Prince Prince knocks down to three he is such a good Corner shooter that was just above the corner but he knocks down over 45% from that corner area but Victor Wembanyama one with the shot fake from the corner but gets around Giannis never touched any Rim talk about Elite field welcome back to Milwaukee Victor Wembanyama is the first player in NBA history to score 2,000 points 300 blocks and have 200 threes in his first 100 games you see a couple of buckets there that are amazing as well and when I spoke to his teammate Harrison Barnes today I asked him what surprised him about the 21-year-old Phenom and he said well I got to be honest with you his laser focus his Focus about being great and mastering everything that he does just on the floor guys he said whether it's playing chess or even if you wanted to play him at pingpong if you beat him at anything for example Harrison said if you would have beat him at pingpong he'd go out and buy a ping pong table and come back master that and beat you that's the type of laser focus that Victor Wembanyama has about the game of basketball and anything he does he wants to be the best great Point George a voracious appetite for competition here's Giannis from outside wide right a little bit and here's Harrison Barnes into the front Court Barnes has me so much as George alluded to to the Spurs team one of the younger rosters here he is on the roll against Prince inside knocks it home off glass Harrison Barnes scores buckets Jay and takes on tough defensive assignments like tonight and always uses the glass very well another great Corner shooter top 10 in the NBA but both he and Chris Paul Harrison Barnes have been great leaders for the San Antonio team they they needed that Jame was looking to draw the foul and ended up getting the perfect car on to Lopez for the bucket might ask for the assist yes 1715 Spurs with the lead I like the fact if you're Milwaukee you see Andre Jackson pressuring Chris Paul almost the full 94 ft well it makes it more difficult for Paul but it also takes time off the clock that's less time you have to guard in in the front Court it just makes your defense better Charles Bassey knocks home that shot four-point lead for San Antonio pass the winway point of the first quarter Giannis crosscourt to Lopez tried to spray it to the corner to Prince It's deflected out of bounds with 10 to go on the shot clock Ken Johnson will check into the ball game for the Spurs as well Jones Tre Jones and Khris Middleton will come into a round of applause a curious perhaps Round of Applause by these bucks bans along with Bobby Portis so Khris Middleton is coming off the bench for now says Doc Rivers trying to still work him into condition still on a minute restriction inside for Antetokounmpo fouled on the Alley and he'll get a couple of free throws yeah Khris Middleton didn't play in that game against Toronto was the first one he sat out after playing 12 straight just a little bump as Giannis was heading toward that L that foul is going to go against Bassie his first personal foul Antetokounmpo back at the free throw line missed his first two foul shots a little bit earlier but Giannis leading the NBA in scoring and perhaps tracking towards another MVP on it key part of Greg Buckner's defense as we take a look at the upcoming National TV schedule MBA TV on Thursday as Minnesota in Orlando at 7 eastern time NBA TV Friday has Thunder versus the Knicks at TNT next Tuesday has the Cavaliers who defeated OKC in the first half of our double head on a great game they take on the Pacers at seven then nuggets Mavs at the Mavs trying to get right right now without Kyrie and Luca they've dropped five consecutive contests until they handed it to the Lakers yep nice bounce back win for them Bassie out top Vassell on the drive and Lillard with the board well Vassell didn't get that to go but he's gotten off to a good start in this game and defensively he's done a good job Khris Middleton back in the game maybe gave a little bit too much help on DNE Lillard and left Khris Middleton wide open and with Khris Middleton's history you don't want to do that often a lethal mid-range and long range shooter as Champagnie counters at the other end when Champagnie catches the ball in the corner that's like a layup to him he shoots such a high percentage on Corner threes especially catch and shoot Lillard inside had it knocked away out of bounds it'll stay Milwaukee basketball Deon Vassell just trying to stop that penetration by Lillard and then's got to recover out to Middleton in a catch and shoot situation Middleton such an outstanding shooter even though he's missed so much time still shooting over 40% from three AJ Green knocking down shots of late as well talked about the shooting that they put around at Antetokounmpo has been lethal of late as they knock the game at 22 well green shoots 45% from three that's third in the lead what a great story is out of Northern Iowa undrafted a few years ago here's Giannis leading the break and Giannis saw him the whole way found him too and found the right result green with a green light he saw him the whole way and just gave it a Look Away almost like a quarterback that was not wanting to give away his second read but that was his first read what a great pass Jones on the drive Cel drives the close out Jones one more to a wide open Keldon Johnson and rebounded by Portis well they didn't get it to go but San Antonio got a piece of the paint and then Swing Swing for a wideopen three they swing it to Portis here at the other end and Johnson rebounds it this Milwaukee defense much improved from a season ago they're up to number 10 in defensive rating good Rim protection right there but San Antonio with another opportunity Johnson back on top to Vassell kin Johnson looks like a different player this year they told me that he lost 30 PBS as Vassell there's a little light on that shot but Johnson is down to about 8% body fat after hiring a chef but it's Giannis that's eating right now with a slam inside to give the Bucks a five-point lead Giannis is averaging six assists per game his eyes were never on AJ Green but he saw him the whole way and then late in transition that's an easy bucket want all you got to do is get in with me let's take a look at tonight fresh take brought to you by Subway and some of the numbers from the reigning Emirates NBA Cup champs the Milwaukee Bucks going 6 and0 and all other games 12 and 16 when you look at the numbers though J beyond the numbers Doc Rivers feels like he has a team that is built for the playoffs and all the important moments in it yeah it's been interesting and talking to Doc Rivers today you he said something I thought was really interesting he said you put something in front of us and we can beat anybody meaning you put a trophy in in front of us the playoff you know obviously talking about toward the playoffs but there's been a lot of talk recently since that win in the NBA cup Milwaukee's been losing to essentially some Lottery teams and there's been talk about hey we're not playing right we're not taking the right approach there's been frustration there's no presence on defense things like that but I think Doc Rivers feels like you know like they've had some illness recently you know Giannis and Damian have missed four games each uh two of those games each for illness uh and Khris Middleton just getting back into the swing of things but I think they feel really confident that if they are healthy and playing well at the end of the year that they can really do some damage in the playoffs yeah we saw the heightened intensity from Giannis and from Damian Lillard Giannis with the offensive rebound cleared a little bit of space as Milwaukee down in the middle of a 10 to nothing run they lead it by seven yeah l Leman Yama was right there but Giannis just discarded him out of the play into the corner kin Johnson driving on Portis got to the rim in that quickness that he has at his lighter frame at 225 baying dividends he's got his first bucket and because Giannis has to be all the way out there with Wembanyama there's no Rim protection there Lopez out of the game Wembanyama will bring it across how many times you see a 74 75 guy bringing the ball all up cour a lot of people putting their minds around it still and you feel good about it yeah they talk about letting him remain creative with limited guard rails Castle on the Baseline and off the Miss here's Middleton Khris Middleton's minutes restriction right around 22 23 minutes Giannis is going to walk down Jenny and say it with his chest you get to one side of Giannis and he gets that contact Indian spins right off of it there's no stopping that Antetokounmpo in double digit scoring with 11 you'll Mark that last possession Wembanyama got Gary Trent Jr switched off on him he's got to get the ball in the post there he's been much more decisive to just turn and shoot over Champagnie has it stuck on automatic here early knocks down his second three ball green it'll count he draws iron as Mamukelashvili leads by four 31-27 after 12 minutes of play welcome back to NBA Wednesday presented by St arm we're here with Mitch the head coach of the Spurs what do you like from that first quarter you're down here but what what positives can you take I thought we showed crowds on a couple possessions a few times we didn't get back in transition but for the most part I think we made him play in a crowd Giannis said that the Copo and your former college teammate Brook Lopez have combined for six buckets what do you got to do to contain them Summer Brook for from three again when you show crowds if they make sh it makes it tough I think they made six or seven threes that's a little bit what we're trying to do take away the rim so couple other things we didn't uh navigate a switch well we gave up offensive rebound transition we didn't get back some of those little things the thre's exacerbated but it's really the other stuff coach thank you good luck thank you guys back to you all right Mitch the interim head coach of the San Antonio Spurs L coach GRE papovich who's still out Champagnie knocks down another three-pointer that's his third one in his many tries and the lead is backed it down to three and champan so quick from the catch to the release but a great story here Damian left it on the front rim Spurs out in running they got a three on two Kledon Johnson threw the contact whistle and that's going to be a charge welcome back if you one to five Sur form in Milwaukee the announcement a moment ago by Josh tib the official that the challenge is successful the call on the floor was a charge on Keldon Johnson it has been overturned to a block on Khris Middleton subsequent to that Jay you're the lawyer sitting between here the two of us I mean two free throws now right two free throws yeah the officials basically in replay determined that Middleton was still moving a bit to his left after the upward motion had started by Keldon Johnson so it was a successful Challenge and the call was overturned Keldon Johnson making a seamless adjustment to coming off the bench remember a couple years ago he was the leading scorer on a team that didn't win many games they average 22 a game in 2023 pre Wembanyama Tre Jones with the nice hit ahead to Castle skips through missed the layup but drew the foul and Castle will go to the free throw line for a couple of shots he's shooting 71% from the strike they don't want him turning down shots they want him to stay aggressive as a rookie it's going to be the second foul against Keldon Johnson pardon me well Castle Middleton Castle's hit 30 what 34 threes on the year but he's only shooting 26 27% from three but San Antonio really believes that he's going to be a consistent good shooter so they don't want him passing up good open shots when he gets them and he to his credit he's not done that I think what one of the things that's really impressed the Spurs organization is how well he passes and he showed that at Yukon but he's got the ball in his hands much more now than he did when he was playing for Dan Hurley they might have him on the kawii Leonard program here we know how that worked out Damian lacerating the lane getting the bucket that's his first field goal in his 10 minutes of play and Milwaukee back up by two well Ka Leonard has the benefit of Chip England who's now with Oklahoma City one of the best shooting coaches in the game no doubt rebound by Bobby Portis so with Giannis on the bench Damian usually taking the opportunity to get going Lopez on the pick and pop and doing it in transition Lopez with those step ups and drag ball screens in transition that's really difficult for Wembanyama give help on the ball and then you got to recover out to Lopez who shoots it so well from so far out Champagnie putting it on the deck working against Middleton Porter switches on to a Middleton on the switch as Wembanyama 15-footer comes off to Lopez so the Bucks going to stop the number 10 rated defense in the NBA this year yeah really it's been some offensive issues for Milwaukee this year didn't think that was going to be a problem but defensively they P performed at a at a pretty high level well from the free throw line little bit strong and here's Tre Jones finds Castle little float game is good and castle with another bucket three-point lead this is the first of four games on the road for the San Antonio Spurs after this game they'll fly to Los Angeles which is at the center of a lot of news right now because of the nature cataclysm that's happening right there with the fires off the steel Wembanyama good catch by Johnson Wembanyama for three and Portis with the board Bo how about that steal though on the other end by Wembanyama came over as a double teaming big guy and took the ball away J that's going to be a foul against Castle trying to contain Damian Lillard that's his first personal foul let's take one more look at that steal you were alluding to when Wembanyama comes over on the double team and uses those great hands to knock that ball away plays the game with poise that belies his age he just turned 21 years old several days ago folks Portis on the drive has it come off to Johnson San Antonio has numbers if they want it here's Mamukelashvili at an open three defer to Champagnie and that's one of his rare misses from Deep Trent Jr one more to Lopez some Chase action Trent Jr gets it back Wembanyama switches on to him Portis with the mismatch missed it inside after having a good look tried to go at the basket with Wembanyama out on the perimeter oan Champagnie got peeled clean long Outlet to Prince crosscourt and Damian going to run things spits it back out to Prince and he left that three on the front rim Lopez has been open a couple times for threes and Milwaukee just hadn't found him Milwaukee's three-point shooting right now seven of 16 Johnson spins on Lopez classy move Inside by Keldon Johnson who forces doc River to call the timeout welcome back everyone let's take a look now at tonight's Starwatch brought to you by GoDaddy Milwaukee's had good success using Brook Lopez in some ball screen action and pulling Victor Wembanyama away from the basket he's just come off Lopez has you see him working that pick and pop action and ready to shoot when the ball arrives he's just coming off a game in which he had 16 points hitting four of eight from three against the Raptors and with that deep range that he's got that can really open up the floor for Milwaukee really impactful at both ends of the floor Brook Lopez a guy that's often overlooked when you stare down the roster Lillard draws a lot of attention that's why knocking down a three ball D shooting right around 37% from Deep on the season after the timeout just using Damian Lillard as a screener first then popping out to the line Milwaukee leading by four Champagnie being guarded by Lillard Wembanyama against Giannis shot clock down to four Giannis being extremely physical got a piece of it here's Mamukelashvili at the end of the shot clock and that's a good stop by the Bucks Bo what what a different look for Milwaukee out of that last time out with all that ball Antetokounmpo couldn't get the Lefty layup to go a little bit strong here's Chris Paul since he was out for those four games part of it with that illness you know Giannis has not finished as well around the basket as he had earlier in the season it's a great Point Jane to think that he's still shooting well over 60% from the field is pretty amazing it's remarkable really but that that illness took a lot out of me he's still at a little bit of a deficit as is Damian Lillard Lillard will go to the free throw line with a couple of shots you bring up a good point after winning the NBA cup the Emirates NBA cup as we take a look at this replay first yeah look how he's getting into his body but it started with Damian Lillard really getting into the ball and when Lillard wants to defend he can defend but the ball pressure both by Lillard and a Antetokounmpo on that last possession was what led to that near shot clock violation and a bad shot at the end of the clock hey folks next Wednesday we have a star studded ESPN NBA double header for you first it's Jolan beid in the 76ers hosting Jaylen Brunson in the Knicks at then to cap off the night it's Tyler hero in the heat taking on LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers as Damian knocked down the second free throw I was talking about the the flu bug or whatever it was that ran through the Milwaukee box roster in the immediate aftermath of their Emirates NBA Cup Championship Victory off the Miss it's Prince with the rebound it really had its toll on their two stars in particular Lillard and Giannis who are just now still getting back to form Lillard sprays it to the corner that was deflected out of bounds or not cly D floring doc to challenge it and they're not going to call timeout that's the third turnover doc looking back at his bench saying hey we challenge this or not doc says we're going to put that one on layway halfway through the second quarter both teams taking pretty good care of the basketball just three turnovers each and it's Antetokounmpo with another rebound he'll bring it across Lopez with a deep three and Barnes with the rebound well he didn't get that to go but because San Antonio was throwing So Many Bodies at Giannis he is wide open for that a good pass out here's shamp peny after starting off hot he's missed his last couple three attempts and Giannis into the front court again we haven't seen many of those midrange jumpers that he's gotten so much better at this year Lopez in traffic and won Lopez with a little muscle in his hustle well you saw Harrison Barnes guarding Giannis and then Bassie came over and that left Brook Lopez wide open Vassell tried to come down and knock it away but it was too late just a terrific find by Giannis and you know that terrific job he did against Toronto when the Raptors threw So Many Bodies his way at 10 assists in the first half I think wound up with 13 overall yeah an 11o 12 re rebound 13 assist triple double it right now Milwaukee in the middle of an 8 nothing Sprint off the double drag it's Chris Paul inside to Bassie with a great feed but he smoked the layup prince in transition they've got numbers four on three green with an easy Lane AJ Green he he doesn't get many twos 90% of his shots or from three-point range and when you shoot it like he does it might take a two but that one you can't turn down ninepoint pardon me 11-point lead now for the bucks Champagnie around the world against Lillard good defense by Damian wonderful effort to get the stop well Milwaukee's really turned up the heat the last several possessions better ball pressure Prince for three and contact underneath that's going to be a foul against San Antonio that's going to be the fourth team foul that's going to go against Chris Paul just watch Chris Paul that's two hands in the back a little slip on top of it but he put two hands in a player's back and he winds up underneath that's going to be a foul that's going to be his first personal Chris Paul coming off a great effort in Chicago at 18 points and nine dimes for the Spurs as they lost a late double digit lead in Chicago a couple of nights ago yeah that that had to be maybe their most disappointing loss of the season they had a 19point lead did San Antonio against Chicago and they went scoreless the last three minutes a 10 nothing Bulls run Kobe White had two unbelievable plays down the stretch and there's the mid-range Jay that we've been alluding to and the Improvement the precipitous rise in efficiency by Giannis from the mid-range it just makes a tremendous weapon even more of a weapon Mel left that short the loose ball rebound comes out to Bassie Barnes with another chance Champagnie drives the close out good resistance at The Rim by Giannis Antetokounmpo in transition finds Damian dollar Giannis is looking like he's going to lead the league in assist this year instead of scoring you know you have when he's in transition with the ball you have to load up the lane and that means he's going to be able to find a shooter if they run whistling a foul against Milwaukee and Giannis the distributor at work in a big way tonight he's already got six assists and J this is a veteran team that doesn't have a lot of thorough bridge but they can run and score they've got a number of guys that can space the floor and can really shoot it you know Gary Trent Jr can shoot it green can really shoot it Bobby Portis is an excellent shooter especially from the corners Taurean Prince can shoot it Lopez can shoot it obviously Damian Lillard one of the best scorers the NBA's ever known can shoot it so there's a lot of weapons to really help Giannis and space around him 16-point lead from Milwaukee Chris Paul for three knocks it down to stop the hemorrhaging well you mentioned it I think he's getting more aggressive looking to score in addition to distribute that 18 points he had against Chicago were huge Lopez missed everything left at Short we're going to have a loose ball foul it's going to stay at this end as Chris Paul and Khris Middleton we wrestling for the basketball you see the dismay etched across the countenance of Chris Paul he's going to get his second personal foul and that's going to put his team in the penalty let's take one more look at it Khris Middleton will go to the free throw line yeah I'm not sure the first one against Giannis I got two hands in the back that one didn't that just looked like rebounding but well Middleton is going to go to the free throw line we mentioned the fact that he missed the first 21 games of the season after offseason surgery on both ankles and the juggling act right now is for Doc Rivers to well have his team continue to win games but transition him into a starting role sometime amidst some of the the turnover well you can't imagine how difficult it is to come back from one ankle surgery let alone d ankle surgery but one thing that's been impressive about Middleton you he hadn't shot the ball over the last several games as well as he's capable but his assists have been way up this year he's averaging five assists a game over 12 games good hands by Lillard who is very intentional and purposeful of the defensive end tonight seeing a good performance from him tonight Jay as Trent Jr checks into the ball game Damian will sit down with 10 points on two of five from Deep yeah in the second quarter I think the Milwaukee defense has been much more focused and much more focused on ball pressure CP three for three got it laast it over Lopez they got the switch lead is back down to 11 Giannis the primary ball handler off the flat ball screen pick and pop action with Lopez gets it back against Wembanyama Giannis downhill got hung on the rim then got peeled clean by Chris Paul good defense by the Spurs all lost to handle retrieved it against Green sprays it out to Vassell for three Chris Paul battling underneath but it comes off to Trent Jr Teno to Green good catch green over wh oh knocks it home what a shooting stroke AJ Green has Castle trying to counter and rebounded by Middleton on the move back to green pulls it an aous three by AJ Green this is the version of the Milwaukee Buck that Doc Rivers believes hey you put some in front of us we can beat anybody I guess you put Victor Wembanyama in front of the Bucks in the first half and they're going to get out to a big lead they've really responded Vassell responds with a three of his own as we approach one minute to go AJ Green with consecutive threes at the other end though he's got 14 already I'm guessing he might get a touch here on the ghost screen it comes to Trent Jr instead now Giannis on the Block against Harrison Barnes Harrison Barnes had no chance on that J well when you're fading away and get that kind of height and Jan is still messing with that right hand that he got a few stitches in after that last game against Toronto he had a chase down block against RJ Barrett and hit his right hand in between his Ren finger and pinky finger and it was bleeding the whole rest of the game rib resistance and it's Peak Giannis with the block wow he canceled that flight but he's done everything in this game score assists blocks at The Rim Middleton off the screen by Lopez playing with his food over Barnes and it comes off they'll get another chance Lopez from Deep got it now does that count as a stick back it does in today's NBA castle at the buzzer and that's the end of the first half of play as the Milwaukee Bucks finish with a torrent of three-point shooting to pull ahead 65 to 46 Lopez with 17 Giannis with 15 coming up on the halftime presented by Hyundai a recap of the Thunder Cavs game highlights of our game Michael Lees and Nicole Brisco in the studio with that on the Hyundai Hal time AJ Green and then Giannis at the other end patrolling the skies for the bucks and the showdown between Wembanyama and Giannis it's the bucks with the lead so far you're watching NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm from Milwaukee Wisconsin five Sur form the first meeting of the Season between the Bucks and the Spurs let's take a look at our first half stats brought to you by ESPN bet four different players for the bucks in double digit scoring that ties their largest halftime lead of the Season moving forward Lopez Leading The Way with 17 Mark Jones court side along with Jay bis George Sedano joining us in just a bit this was arguably the best first half for Milwaukee at both ends of the floor and Giannis and ten kopo J was in the middle of everything he had his fingerprints all over it he looked awfully motivated going against Victor Wembanyama 15 points on seven of 12 from the field for Giannis nine rebounds seven of them defensive but what was really impressive to me Mark was his passing uh San Antonio's trying to show him a lot of bodies when he gets a double team or gets loaded up on he is finding his teammates and I think his especially in the second quarter you saw the pressure on the ball really ratchet up for Milwaukee and they were contesting every shot there were very few open shots for San Antonio in that second quarter and in a on the game Monday that Milwaukee played against Toronto they were 22 of 44 in that game from three-point range 50% they had 22 threes in that's this first half against San Antonio 12 of 24 and lot of that was because Giannis was Finding open teammates when he got multiple players guarding him or at least shadowing him and Victor Wembanyama was conspicuous by his offensive silence in that second quarter he didn't score a point in the second period on only two field goal attempts Lillard brings it into the front Court to start the third quarter Andre Jackson the starting two guard with Lillard in the back court jiannis sets the ball screen Barnes switches on to Lillard shot clock already down to five for Lopez out at midcourt they got to work quickly Lopez gets it off in time Jackson gives them another opportunity boy what a great play by Andre Jackson Jr Giannis with the reverse slam Giannis very intelligently waiting for Wembanyama to essentially fly by so he could go to the other side of the basket even Giannis notices his presence around the 10 wonderful discernment by the Bucks big band here's when Wembanyama throws the Lop for Castle wonderful find to Barnes for three and Harrison Barnes knocks it down that's the passing that Mitch was telling us about before the game that really impressed him from Stefan Castle we saw it at UCONN but not quite to this level he has the ball in his hands a little bit more but that was that was when banana as a pick and roll ball handler on that last play here's Lillard step back three over Vassell it's pure a Lillard up to 13 on the night on a very efficient four of eight from the field he gets separation as well as any guard in the lead everybody knows Damian puts in the work and the time gets back to the gym for two sometimes three a day shooting sessions with Phil Beckner as personal trainer Wembanyama from Deep laces that three ball we had a feeling we might hear a little bit more from here in the third quarter after being quiet in the second Wembanyama up to 10 we saw the pride of the two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the first half we're going to see some of the pride of Victor Wembanyama in this second oh Giannis put him in the weight room Jay must have been a shoulder day today for Giannis just went right into his chest and he shot straight back here's Barnes on the wing on the show and go that deceleration ation move for the reverse Harrison Barnes The Savvy veteran so important for what these spurs have accomplished this year here's Giannis against Barnes this time it's not Wembanyama the double team comes from Vassell and Giannis left it short 18-point lead Barnes little bit strong even with a good blockout Wembanyama can knock it away wow that lob even too high for Wembanyama but Barnes comes up with the steal good hands by Damian but it deflects right to Vassell look got a whistle and stop the play is what do we have infection control or somebody look at Giannis right now going one-on-one against Wembanyama he just gets right into him and knocks him straight back and that is strength by the two-time MVP I remember speaking with Giannis not that long ago and him telling me Jay that from the day he stepped into the NBA at the combine in fact to where he is now he has put on 51 lbs of muscle you remember what he looked like in in Chicago at the combine of life and wiry yeah that was back in 2013 and you knew he was going to get stronger but I mean look at his shoulders now he is four formidable and when he gets going to the basket in transition you're like nobody's getting in front of him leads the NBA and fast break points that's going to be a foul against Lillard pushing Barnes into the back court let's go to George Jones EJ I spoke to Mi the head coach or the interm head coach of the Spurs at halftime about what adjustments they can make and he specifically said on defense they have a lot of things they need to work on particularly the transition defense how they're the Bucks are able to spray to the outside and nail those three-point shots that the Spurs 12 three-pointers has really hurt this team on defense they need do a much better job of getting out to those Shooters and defending in transition guys all right George that time Chris Paul knocking down the long ball that's the dilemma though for a lot of teams that play Milwaukee because Jay as we've talked about they spread the floor so well with their shooting they not only spread the floor Jonesy but their ability to stretch the defense I mean if you've got a non shooter on the floor yeah you don't have to guard that guy you got to guard just about everybody with the lineups that Doc Rivers can put on the floor and Chris Ball getting much more aggressive looking to hunt that three ball he's knocked down four on four attempts tonight and brought his team back to within 12 this copyrighted broadcast that a National Basketball Association may not be retransmitted reproduced rebroadcast or otherwise distributed or used in any form with without the express written consent of the NBA hey the college football playoffs semi-finals are on ESPN tomorrow night Notre Damian taking on Penn State in the Capital One Orange Bowl in Miami then on Friday it's Ohio State and Texas in the Goodyear cotton bow classic in Arlington Texas as the college football playoff winds to a crescendo and a big close in hey San Antonio Spurs meanwhile find themselves in the midst of an itinerant existence coming up here Jay well traveled look at that 13 games in the month of January they're going to travel about 20,000 mil 20 days away from home including two games in Paris against the Pacers it's just a a really important part of the schedule it's going to be brutal but you know this time last year after 36 games what was San Antonio 6 and 30 and now they're 18 and 18 with a still a very young team but a legitimate shot to to reach the playoffs out of the West I mean they still have a chance to do that well the good news is we've got a quadruple header on the 25th and that game on the 25th in Paris is going to be on our air I think I figured out why they're going to Paris Jay you the big fell for I was not Magna Kumar but that one's an easy one 805 to go in the third qu quarter AJ Green in the ball game Damian in the back court as well Giannis partially blocked by wiim Wembanyama no whistle back the other way they got numbers five on four Barnes lost his balance but drew the foul in the process now Wembanyama was blown by on this drive by Giannis but made the recovery now Giannis thinks he got fouled maybe there was a little contact the referee said it was all ball they got he certainly got ball first because when Wembanyama is so unique plays that we just saw are they hard do you think for officials to officiate some of course yeah I think both in college and the NBA the officials are really good at letting the play happen before they whistle it right so some some fans may say hey this a late whistle they just let the play go so they could process it yeah you're seeing you're seeing blocks where usually when a guy gets blown by by Giannis there that's going to be a dunk and the play is going to be over once the blowby happens but when Wembanyama is so lengthy and has such great timing such great hands he can wind up turning that into a block which he just did and the Spurs have cut the lead down to 10 Lillard inside when B with a block with a foul first that'll send Lillard to the free throw line already with 13 points in a very efficient first half when you play with Wembanyama I think it's in incumbent upon you as a Defender to be really disciplined and look it's tough not to foul there but you can't foul when you've got a weapon like that that can wipe it away give him the chance to block it that foul is going to go against Wembanyama his second personal foul Damian Lillard at the free throw line you see Chris Paul picking up this drive here now he he donees foul he wound up causing him to go right into Wembanyama but anytime you're guarding the ball and Wembanyama is behind you even when he's not behind you he's going to get to the rim you don't want to foul before he has the chance to block it or change it know what you do you just yell help help not too much but just enough not even sure you have to yell with Wembanyama out there Castle bullying his way inside and Giannis with a rebound Milwaukee with numbers five on four tenac it's Lopez the trailer butter and another assist for Giannis Antetokounmpo he's trending towards a back-to- back triple double here he's got seven Dives and last two games Brook Lopez has made nine threes and there's still a long way to go in this one boy Prince just suffocating wom Wembanyama here's Chris Paul Lopez switches on to him there's the mismatch Barnes draws the hit Harrison Barnes will go to the free throw line once again Giannis especially over the last two games has done such a a good job of drawing Defenders and finding open teammates and Brook Lopez in transition just runs to that three-point line and when he was playing under Mike buher I mean they stretched the floor two or three steps along that three-point line so they could step into three-point shots and Lopez can shoot it from really deep that that line is nothing to him yeah and along that line of thought Jay there are a lot of MB teams now where when they scrimmage during practices they'll extend that three-point line another three or four feet and make it a four-point line to really make sure that the teams get into the habit of shooting extended threes yeah and to get the spacing even better but at least that way you're stepping in to the line instead of Towing the line Giannis in the mid-range that's a rare Miss from him from that distance tonight he's knocked down a couple already the lead at 13 Prince on Chris Paul pick and pop with Harrison Barnes and Harrison Barnes on his hbo which means help a brother out he sure did there Chris Paul has always been a lead in ball screen offense straight line drive and one Antetokounmpo with an opportunity for the three-point Play Just stretched out that left hand and even when banama finds that difficult to get to got into his body first and Giannis is just so strong just like a running back going for through the line protecting the ball so they can't punch it away Antetokounmpo up to 21 points right now talking about that mid-range which has become so much more accurate he's concentrating on shooting the ball on the way up and even from the free throw line Jay and also getting a little bit more arc on the ball well the basket gets bigger the more Arc you use but you know that point about shooting it on the way up that's where all your power comes from as a shooter a lot of guys that shoot it at the Apex on the way down are trying to guide it Damian knows when to shoot it drives it this time finds Giannis in the dunker and that one ends up with Andre Jackson Giannis points to his chest says my bad everybody knew that it's a reflex reflex action 13-point lead for Milwaukee looking for their 19th win of the Season against 16 defeats Harrison Barnes keeping the Spurs in it this quarter with 12 points in the period inside good pass by Chris Paul well that's just a double drag up top roll space action Bassie found himself wide open just a beautiful pass from Chris Paul lead back down to 11 five and a half to play in the third into the corner Lopez pulls the three hit the side at backboard and San Antonio can get this into single digits nice In-N-Out dribble by Chris Paul who conck on the three time out Doc Rivers in Milwaukee and the lead is down to eight points Chris Paul very intentional about trying to score tonight got a clean look and didn't need much base hey next Wednesday we have a star studed ESPN NBA double head for you first it's Joel embiid in the 7 Sixers hosting jayen Brunson in the Knicks at then the cap off the night it's Tyler herro in the heat taking on Lebron in the Los Angeles Lakers boy Miami bouncing back on the second night of a back-to-back winning in San Francisco last night against Golden State behind a balanced effort May hakz playing some good basketball on this road trip for the heat Chris Paul and Harrison Barnes keeping the Spurs in this game in the third quarter Paul Especial has been really aggressive offensively and he was very aggressive he had a bunch of singled digigit scoring games going into that game against Chicago and put up 18 against the Bulls and made a lot of really good decisions Jay Jonesy it feels like Chris Paul has taken advantage in this third quarter of the deep drop that the Bucks are playing here defensively yeah I think that's right but anytime he's in a pick and roll situation he makes such good decisions you know came off that last one shot it back to an open shooter at the three-point line boy Damian gets the separation the counts knocks down the midi make it a 10-point game again a little over four minutes to go yeah the last possession he tried to throw that lob to Giannis and he would have been better off pulling up for that short Jumper in the lane this time Portis switches on to Paul he's playing with his food out there fires and rebounded by Milwaukee Damian Lillard with 17 in the game off the screen Giannis rolls it goes to the corner Portis pulls and Johnson hands it off to Chris Paul Spurs on the move Champagnie and here's Middleton Middleton in 13 minutes tonight has four points he's only taken three shots Lillard step back three got it Damian with 20 and if it's Damian time it means a timeout for San Antonio creat space as well as any guard in the league simple step back and a beautiful stroke from Deep Milwaukee with four players in double digits scoring three of them with 20 or more including Antetokounmpo Lillard and Brook Lopez and Giannis has seven assists to go along with those 22 points and 12 rebounds and Lopez and Lillard are a combined nine of 17 from three for those 40 points they've combined for first time this season they've had those three with 20 or more let's see what the Spurs run out of the timeout the cell off the Flair Johnson hands it off to Vassell pulls up over green and it comes out Loose P has tapped it to Tren here's AJ Green who had that fabulous shooting first half Middleton off glass just not great transition defense by San Antonio and a good pass ahead advanced pass by AJ Green quick catch and shoot by Vassell rattles home Devin Vassell rounding into shape after getting a slow start to the season because of that foot injury he missed all of Camp he was out for what seven or eight months he's a great story one of several on that Spurs roster J historically they always seem to find those guys for sell out of Florida State but get this folks going back to high school didn't play a lot of AA basketball his dad told me he had two offers coming out of high school Jay one was Presbyterian College the other one was University of North Florida and here he is in the NBA he'd rather be a SEO than a blue hose blue hose I knew their nickname the blue ho that's Presbyterian College's nickname I knew that first bucket of the ball game for Bobby Portis off of Doc's bench Vassell inside green with the steel bucks off and running Middleton with Giannis back out to Trent Middleton relocates Portis thought about it Middleton for three tipped up Giannis underneath couldn't gather it's knocked out of bounds it'll stay at that end Milwaukee basketball pretty good Patience by Milwaukee they had opportunities to take some shots there but waited until they got a wide openen one just missed it Giannis at the elbow DC Rivers trying to play him off the elbow a little bit more this year Portis had that partially blocked by Bassie Who falls down in front of us Champagnie pulls a three San Antonio shooting at about 43% from downtown but looking for some here to get it back within double digits or lower last few times down Giannis has tried to force some passes it's almost like he's trying to rack up assists instead of making the right play made so many great plays in the first half Mell with a couple of track drives from downtown and Portis with good hustle to keep it in play he is such a valuable player Giannis on the drive got to the rim and couldn't finish those are some of the layups he hasn't been finishing the last four or five games that are unusual and Keldon Johnson finished that layup J for the three-point play attempt going to be a foul against Bobby Portis that's amazing you miss a chippy on one end and it wind up giving up transition on the other and Bobby Portis just giv up a foul there that was unnecessary so when Wembanyama will come back into the ball game on four of eight from the field total of 10 points six rebounds for the big man Bobby Portis committing the foul on Johnson Johnson said it was a total lifestyle change that allowed him to drop that 30 lbs over the summer hiring a chef has its benefits Jay bis I wouldn't know I'm I'm usually the chef you're making dinner huh Middleton drew the foul on the play what do you make of Khris Middleton tonight so far I know we're almost three quarters into it but what are your thoughts I mean he's looked good you know Doc Rivers was saying before the game you know he can he can kind of tell he and his staff can kind of tell with his movement on defense because it it can be difficult game after game for his lateral movement it's not necessarily a pain issue we all remember how great Middleton was in that Series against the Indiana Pacers last year hit a buzzer beater in Indianapolis in one of those Road games in that series of course Giannis was unable to play in that series and Damian was injured as well the Bucks severely under man right now leading by 12 against the Spurs with 31 seconds to go in the third quarter Johnson comes out of the ball game it'll be Tre Jones and Chris Paul in the back court the lead back up to 13 it's late in the third quarter obviously to see if they can get victor Wembanyama involved he hasn't felt involved in this third I since the first quarter he hadn't really been involved this ball off the Stagger Giannis switches onto him there's the mismatch Wembanyama from 19 a little bit strong well defended five to go for Antetokounmpo working against Tre Jones sprays it to the corner middlen and that's the end of three periods Milwaukee leading by 13 Antetokounmpo with 22 to lead the way welcome back to NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm here with Doc Rivers the head coach of the Bucks you guys are the second best three-point shooting team in the league but you're even outdoing yourself today 15 threes thus far so let me ask you this what has led to the success there so far well defensive stops and then ball movement exactly what we didn't do in that quarter right there uh I I thought we came out really flat defensively and that effect us on the offensive L we get to the paint with the shootings Shooters we have we'll get great shots how do you fix though that defensively you better get socks we just got to be more physical I thought we l up in physicality all right doc good luck thank you all right guys back to you all right thanks a lot George and Milwaukee with possession here off the turnover Lillard drives it Middleton in the corner against Barnes good look Portis over when Wembanyama got it back missed twice and that's what he does does around the rim defensively he forces you to rush it you those were two Rush Shots by a a terrific player Bobby Portis but it's like trying to shoot over a 75 praying mantis it's really remarkable the length of his arms and how he can time things out to really go after that ball in the air after it leaves your hand now sometimes he'll block it out of your hand but most of the time it's after it leaves your hand and Tre Jones converts the three-point play at the other end San Antonio hanging around down by 10 here's Lillard working against Jones right to the cup and gets the layup Lillard with 22 you one of the things in the second quarter Jonesy that I thought made Milwaukee's defense much better was their ball pressure they really impacted the ball in the second quarter and you heard when George sodano was talking to to Doc you know he didn't feel like they had that edge defensively in the third quarter can they bring it in the fourth because they the San Antonio team is still hanging around Lillard working against Tre Jones Damian draws the foul we'll go to the free throw line for a couple more shots Lillard with 22 on four of seven from deep and that's the that's the sort of foul that we talked about a little bit earlier you know Tre Jones picking up the foul after Lillard got past him a little bit like don't foul let wbi have a chance to knock that thing away or change it you foul all of a sudden you're putting a great free throw shooter on the line this is what you're talking about right you got a Blow by here but don't make the mistake of fouling here let Wembanyama get over there he's the presence now could he have gotten there I don't know but he gets there a lot and I'd rather have him have the opportunity to block it and put Dan Lillard at the line Lillard knocks down the free throw up to 24 for the game the lead up to 14 he's starting to look like Damiane again after that illness he really is people really underestimate the significant adjustment he had to make last year right before the season began moving everything his entire life to Milwaukee off the steel they got numbers Trent Jr steps back for three knocks it down home what a great Play by Gary Trent Jr read that like a free safety shot the Gap and it used to be you get a turnover you're taking that thing to the rim now you're run to the three-point line This is today's NBA but when you can shoot it like that he's a 41% three-point shooter and you'd have to work really hard in your half court offense to get a shot that wide open and so why not take it Trent Jr's been coming back to the practice facility in Milwaukee and putting in extra hours with Spencer Rivers one of the assistant coaches on the staff how about this when he got traded to Milwaukee from Toronto he got traded on the exact same day his dad did 23 years later the exact same date the two teams the same two teams in the trade that's some kind of karma the basketball at Gods can be funny sometimes Jay but what a put back that time by Keldon Johnson going airborne the lead at 15 quter one more here's Trent Junior again and he's really locked in you know there are nights where after games he'll go right back to the practice facility either with Coach rivers or with his father Gary senior and get up some extra shots if Dad doesn't like what he's seen during the game well it's paying off because the last five games Gary Trent Jr coming into this one was a 11 of 24 from three here's Lopez has the mismatch against Keldon Johnson going to try and take him to the rim finds Middleton behind the ark and Wembanyama corals the loose ball here's Johnson that falls and Keldon Johnson brings them back to within 15 with a little over 9 Minutes To Go San Antonio can't afford to trade basket cuz they got to get stops when banama picks up Lillard oh going to pull this out Portis on Barnes shot clock below five bus kind of stalled out that time J yeah that was a little bit of a settle you don't want to take a contested two oh Lopez the NBA's active blocks leader with another one there Champagnie all over Middleton gets it across Brook Lopez's career has been amazing really little on the kick out inside and a nice reverse layup yeah a great cut off the penetration just too easy to get in the lane the back to Lopez when you think about when he came out of Stanford I mean he was more of a low poost big guy he was the Net's all-time leading scorer never made a three and he turn into a a three-point shooting Rim protecting specialist really amazing there's a lot that he can alchemize the type of change to prolong his career and P is fouled at the other end the only two players I can think of in the NBA that have had that kind of transformation have been Brook Lopez and Al Horford Al Horford you know when Al horer came out of Florida he was a a low post big guy wasn't considered now he he's knocking down threes and spacing the floor for Boston Bobby Portis going to the free throw line for the bucks an 80% free throw shooter Taurean Prince getting ready to come into the ball game for Milwaukee Chris Paul and castle for the Spurs look at that seismic change in the type of shots that he's taking and against Toronto recently he knocked down his 1,000 three of his career and that's going six years without making a single one to start his career when he when doc ravers was saying you know when he was with Brooklyn never you know never made a three was their their leading alltime leading scorer and sometimes uh his bucks teammates when he's shooting too many threes will say hey uh let's get back to Brook Lopez they call him Brook be Brook Lopez that's a that's a key word to activate his low post game here's Lillard that's going to be a block foul against Harrison Barnes we were talking about Damian a little bit earlier has so many fans around the globe here in milwauke in Portland where he spent most of his career but a special one in Oakland where he's from Dorothy buy who's watching the game tonight celebrating her 90th birthday a huge fan of L one of thousands and a nice jump hook there by Brook Lopez Brook Lopez Brook that was Brook Lopez below post game oh you might have heard you Jay Barnes with the Miss Wembanyama kept it alive out to Champagnie here's Barnes we Wembanyama thought about it shot clock down to five for Champagnie that's the right man for the job the wrong result though and here comes Lillard seven minutes to go Damian weaving out to Trent Jr got the hot hand he's got enough to feed the needy tonight Gary Trent Jr three for three from the the NBA on ESPN is presented all season long by State Farm like a good neighbor State Farm is there well this year NBA Allstar is back with a brand new twist you can vote today and everyday to sure your favorite players make it to the Bay this February vote on the NBA app or headit to nba.com vote to cast your ballot now going be an interesting new format at the All-Star Game this year with the several teams knockup format uh we'll see Giannis there several others Damian wmy yeah even a game like this where Wembanyama has not played anywhere near his best he's still got 10 points nine rebounds and three blocks it's on nights like this Jay where you have to remember I think that he just turned 21 several days ago Lillard taking it all the way to the basket Damian up to 26 when Milwaukee is healthy they're going to be heard from in the playoffs I really believe that with the way this team shoots it Giannis commits the foul on Keldon Johnson yeah in transition San Antonio not doing a very good job at all of stopping the ball just through the leg splitting two Defenders getting all the way to the rim with ease was a great move by DNE but not great defense by K Johnson might have got hit on the arm to as kin Johnson goes to the free throw line you know what I've really enjoyed about this game tonight Jay and you and I talked about it during the halftime break the fact that Giannis has taken on the challenge of guarding Wembanyama You' love to see that kind of competitive spirit in today's game when sometimes the quote unquote Stars don't always guard the other star on the other team they sometimes hide them on the other team's worth score yeah I think when uh excuse me Giannis has shown a ton of pride in this game I mean clearly he's motivated having Wembanyama come into this building to say hey look I'm the two-time MVP you're the next thing but I'm the current thing there we go and right now the topical thing and shooter is Trent Jr now four for four from downtown and the three ball continues to fall for Milwaukee Johnson with an answer at the other end and Lopez just needed to have his hands up I mean he wasn't going to take away the drive take away the shot little empty cor or two-man action with Lillard and Giannis nice dump off to Lopez wasn't ready couldn't make the catch and off the turnover here comes Wembanyama up to Johnson inside couldn't get it to fall a good job by Taurean Prince to keep his body right in front of Johnson What A Catch Giannis inside looking for some daylight when Wembanyama fouls on Antetokounmpo that's going to be his fourth foul this was a Next Level catch balls behind him caught it and then you don't think he notices the presence of Wembanyama look at that tried to clear out a little bit with the off arm there momentarily and Giannis getting the MVP chant here in Milwaukee as he should yeah certainly in the conversation no doubt it's kind of hard to say no to Nico yic with the dominant performance he's had but Shay gild gilders Alexander has been just as goodis knocks down the first hey let's take a look at the upcoming National TV schedule NBA TV Thursday tomorrow has t-wolves against the magic at 7 NBA TV Friday OKC against New York at p.m. eastern time TNT next Tuesday has Cavs Pacers followed by nuggets Mavs and what a game tonight between the Cavs and OKC with Cleveland despite the fact that Donovan Mitchell their leading score did not have a great shooting night Jared Allen was outstanding with an impressive double double that speaks to Cleveland's depth and if you're speaking about Awards other than MVP coach of the year has to certainly get leaning towards Kenny Atkinson at some point Kenny ainson has done a a spectacular job in Cleveland and the role definition of that team is so impressive you know Darius Garland looks like a new man right now playing with spider Mitchell and and then Evan Mobley has taken his offense to a new level he's averaging over 18 a game this year Jay I love the fact that the two big man system is working pretty well for them in the way that they run their offense here's Paul over the wing Vassell that rims out to Castle he couldn't get the handle out of bounds it'll stay Spurs basketball with 435 to go AJ Green will come into the ball game and Gary Trent Jr will sit down Green was so good in that first half he had 14 points four of five from three and Trent leaves with 14 points Jay with 44 from Deep so that the prevailing theme of the night the proficient three-point shooting for the bucks I wonder what the horse games look like in practice in Milwaukee me AJ green if he gets an open shot with his feet set it's the equivalent of a layup for anybody else certainly is one of the better hoopers to come out of Iowa recently played against the Murray twins Keegan and Chris in high school Harrison Barnes is an Iowa product went to Ames High School played with Doug mcder in high school I think they went 53 and0 it was Chris Paul trying to turn the corner green a very good Defender but couldn't stop Chris Paul on that occasion Chris Paul six of 10 from the field he's got 18 Milwaukee will jump on the plane and head down to Orlando before coming back home in their next couple of games meanwhile San Antonio will fight to Los Angeles missed a layup take him out doc take him out he's done he's cooked on the pick and pop Johnson drives it on Lopez great use of the left you know what I'm going to ask my wife for a chef for Christmas next year if Keldon Johnson's got a chef I need a chef she'll give you a copy of that movie with John Fabro in it Giannis off the elbow there's that one leged step back that's becoming very routine and very repeatable and very makeable for Antetokounmpo he hit one of those against Toronto the key in that is getting contact into the defender and then going back but that's unblockable did a little work with Drew hanin over the summer on that working with his trainers and the Greek national team as well look at the story of our two quazar on the court tonight Antetokounmpo with the edge 25 points on 11 to 21 and more than anything else he really embraced the challenge of taking on Wembanyama tonight and doing it at both ends of the floor look at the energy that it takes to do it especially defensively J he's been physical with him on the defensive end and actually physical against him on the offensive end but it's the the 25 points and 16 rebounds it's also the eight assists now he's had a few turnovers four turnovers was trying to maybe do too much on a a few plays trying to squeeze an assist in when it wasn't there but just another spectacular perform you know spectacular has become routine for Yan right a guy that averages 31 points a game and when you only have what 25 underachieving oh boy docs holding him back coach is holding him back under three minutes to go and rivers has emptied his bench here's Maron bamp green off the curl and a rare Miss for him Johnson with another rebound for the Spurs brandom looking inside Collins lost control and it comes off to Rollins so Milwaukee will earn its 19th win of the Season against 16 losses green pulls again and missed everything that might have been partially blocked Johnson fouled by Rollins and Keldon Johnson going back to the free throw line for a couple of shots hey Kendrick Perkins joined Sports Center that's coming up next to talk about the matchups from all the games tonight plus the latest on Jaylen Herz injury status and a report from the Orange Bowl ahead of tomorrow night's Big Game sports center with Nicole Brisco Michael EES on ESPN and the ESPN app and Jay we talked about it a little bit earlier tonight at the top of the show with the environmental cataclysm happening in Los Angeles right now with the fires we want to send out our thoughts and prayers for a hedge of protection around our neighbors in California was such a a tragic happening I grew up just south of Pacific Palisades in Rolling Hills in Southern California and have so many friends in that area just devastating and so certainly send out all our best know JJ reck had to move his family out of that area was texting back and forth with him just offering all our best wishes and hope his family is safe Wesley back out to Mamukelashvili for three here's boam another one of those talented players out of the Seattle area Ryan Reynolds with the ball right now or Rollin Ryan Rollins said Ryan Reynolds Ryan Rollins from Toledo he's a good player he's on a two-way contracts hoping to get guaranteed but he he offers a a ton of athleticism and length and he's a really good Defender he's had some moments of Brilliance Jay in the G League what they heard I think he's got 23 more games that he's got to get in in order to become fully guaranteed I tend to think that's going to happen W trending right now whistling a foul as Mamukelashvili goes to the free throw line and speaking of contracts getting guaranteed it was interesting I was joking around with Gary Trent Jr at shoter around this morning about winning the Emirates NBA cup he said yeah the first thing I did was uh you know check to see when that thing hit he said those commas hit a week later right on time no Financial incentive but we saw the best version of the moment hoee bucks from 1 through 15 during the Emirates NBA cup as they took it home and you think about that $500,000 winning prize for each player for guys on two ways that's that's a big deal that's a huge deal for them and Jonesy I was so sorry when Sandro Mamukelashvili left SE Hall so it took me a long time to be able to say Mamukelashvili do you have to give those vowels back I'm just glad to be able to use those skills again tonight 12199 40 seconds to go it's been pretty much all Milwaukee
