 for the Lakers Austin Reaves is now their point guard since the trade of D'Angelo Russell our officials are Trey Maddox John Butler and Matt Bolan and late night from the Left Coast for the last time on this trip off we go on another Miami Heat NBA a adventure and John we start with this match up right here bam and Anthony Davis the two centers of influence oh what a gorgeous back door pass bam made to Tyler there but good having bam back I think we saw the team fall into the Trap of being very perimeter oriented without B in the last game against the Clifford I think he'll give them a little bit more of an interior bent uh and and fine drives and and a few post UPS oh how about that HZ guarding Anthony Davis on the first possession he bullied his way right to the post for the jump hook not an easy match up there Anthony Davis at 610 270 lbs much heavier and stronger than Jaquez long three for Tyler Kaboom did not take long to extend his franchise record streak to a 73rd consecutive game with at least one triple they got that measured as a 27f footer the range is there for Tyler herro you got to guard him from the parking lot that's Max Christie the former Michigan State Spartan third year Pro averaging eight points per game got 40 triples on the season for the Lakers two-point Laker lead ban busy early and knocks in the short jump good attack I like that moveie because it's getting to his left hand he feels very comfortable on the fade away right in his rhythm area there about 12 feet off the dribble so bam is on Davis here and HZ defending LeBron Austin Reaves this is Rui hachimura the former Washington Wizard forward rejected getting locked up by Highsmith but he got it back to a the shot clock LeBron Barrels in got it off and got F oh my with 4/10 of a second left on the 24 second clock such a good defensive possession up until that foul right at the end picks it up HZ on the close out runs to that left side and leaves them open for the Drive Tyler having a step over to prevent a l right as the clock was about to expire commits that foul John two St 18-point games for LeBron he had 18 with seven turnovers in their lost Monday night to the Spurs they got beat at home by 24 they were out scored 73- 40 in the second half of that game Monday night yeah he had seven turnovers LeBron den and to go along with eight assists he has been a prolific P playmaker for them at just under nine assists at game number five in the association with his passing pretty drive and finish for Terry Rozier that part of his game intact Rozier very effective going to the basket heat with a one-point Le two minutes in Reaves got fouled and it dropped in chance at a three-point play for the fourthe man out of Oklahoma yeah he's their third leading score and really been a great fit for them for a guy who's undrafted 18 points a game hard drive here and able to draw the contact and finish he's got size at 65 able to get in there and mix it up a little bit with a guy as big as Jaquez first foul on Jaquez second team foul on M Miami puts Reaves at the stri Reaves averaging a career best 18 points per game he improved the scoring average every year he's been in the leag he's a really good fit with a guy like LeBron and Anthony Davis cuz he can get uh off the ball and really get into the view of LeBron and catch and shoot a lot of open shots as a result Rozier pitching out to an open Highsmith Kaboom nice inside outside basketball for Miami the 50th triple this season for Haywood Heisman the heat ahead by one good shooting early for Miami hitting four of their first five LeBron posting he double here's Chris now Hachimura Davis with the offensive rebound he missed on the putb best rebounders in the league one of the best big men in the league nine-time Allstar Anthony Davis having an excellent 13th year Tyler oh blocked it's going to be a go t yeah hit the backboard first right there and then Hachimura hit a great step through look at the way he split the defense there gets it to the backboard and then the basket interference there in gend I should say by R Hachimura there after ball hit the backb we've only played three minutes we've already had five lead changes LeBron poing up getting the layup to drop LeBron James 22nd year in the league averaging nearly 24 points a game one point hit lead Herro oh off the hands with a cutting Adebayo for Miami's first turnover of the game all right idea though and good look just a little bit behind sideline break here by Los Angeles really looking to move the basketball with the pass here crisply again HZ defending LeBron the cutter Christie good hands by Herro to knock it out of bound yeah I like that recovery Tyler didn't give up on it had his head on a swivel LeBron always willing passer with that back door bounce pass nine on the shot clock for LeBron and the Lakers oh Herro stole the inbound he'd have numbers if they hurry a three in transition a line drive home run for Herro who very quickly in the game's first three and a half minutes has has scored seven points yeah it just went right after the pull up there excuse me on on open opportunity there in transition Rui hachimura gets his first score that's his 50th triple this season back in his old State he played at Gonzaga 8 minutes to go first quarter Miami and the Lakers in a in an offensive oriented start Herro to the paint got foul he is riddling defenses night after night John it's hard to find a way to guard this man well look when he's hitting shots like this in transition with the pullup it's fresh on the defense's mind hey I got to get out and close out on him Christie gets overplay him up top and that allows Tyler to turn the corner and draw the foul and he's been much more proficient getting to that free throw line and and making teams pay great ball fakes as a result he went 10 for 12 in the game against the Clippers uh to to be able to draw fouls and get to that line an important part of his growth folks you can enjoy your Heat basketball you can stream it as a matter of fact live on the FanDuel Sports Network app presented by team open oh here with a couple free

Bam by him he's tripled now in five consecutive games well Anthony Davis slow on the close out to Bam Bam took his time there got his feet right important to establish that early that'll get the Top Shot blocker Anthony Davis out of the out of the paint oh the block shot there by Haywood Highsmith sent it back on Austin Reaves bam down the runway got fouled everything working so well for the heat right now they've made eight of their first nine shots look at this drive and kick action here Haywood Highsmith inside finding b Anthony Davis on the slow walk out close out and that gives bam enough time to get comfortable in that corner and knock it down and on this next possession hard dive right down the middle which is just a a really high percentage play for Miami Anthony Davis tra uh trailing behind so bam had a good look at The Rim joh want to point out the intentionality of Miami's offense Monday night against the Clippers 52 of the Heats 85 shots were threes Eric spuler said that was at an necessity Not By Design the Clippers kept them out of the paint tonight they're they're getting a variety of of plays on the offensive end not one dimension no and I I think a big part of that also is Bam and and you know bam was not in the last game he's back he provides much more of an inside punch with his ability to drive with the ball in his hand finish around the rim and and attack oh Davis doing just that but it's spun out that's a second uh close opportunity he's missed Jaquez in transition gets it back to Bam he with a three-point lead bam against Hachimura oh pretty pass to Highsmith another nice one for Jaquez Highsmith back Taps man he empties the effort tank every night here he comes there he goes you got to love the way that man plays this game Haywood Highsmith all kinds of defense and five first quarter turns yeah nice reaction there Ball's getting deflected and Highsmith found the Gap to be able to drive and finish plays so hard DAV for three got it Anthony Davis he can do that too his 27th triple this season he's got seven points here in the first quarter he's Lakers leading score 26 points a game he is one versatile score Herro baber that's his second turnover and here comes Max Chris watcha Mo threw it right to B he with four turnovers that's only the second on the laks 425 left first quarter Duncan Robinson just in good ball movement Haywood in and out from three yeah really quality look though finding the wing and one extra pass to the corner for the three oh the lob got there pretty touch pass by Austin Reaves to Rui hamur hamur has been active he's using his size post up they get a high low action there with Reaves going right over the top before Miami back uh in their transition defense nine points for Hachimura by the way LeBron the first leg shoved out HZ down the highe highway here in Downtown LA I like that highe highway looks good right there with the contact and one finding the straight line on the diagonal there Anthony Davis late trying to come over to help and they're going to call that foul on Gabe Vincent who tried to get his hand in there High made just a lot to manage as a bigger guy when he gets that full speed going John on this roach CH 15 points a game six rebounds five assist 52% shooting spread out over 34 minutes a game yeah I really uh have enjoyed watching him play on this trip and he's been asked to handle the ball more and and make plays off that dribble and he's done it he's done it well been a very productive trip for him and some of his young teammates like Nikola Jovic who's just checked into the game for Miami Jovic sitting down Highsmith there there's a good look at Gabe Vincent couple good years with the heat couple years in the g- league honing is C and here he is with the Lakers his second season with LA after playing in just 11 games due to injuries last year yeah I talked to him before the game he said it just feels so good to be healthy he's worked so hard to get back and get into the rotation and I'm sure that we're happy to see him back nine points for Anthony Davis a one-point lead for Miami Davis and hachimura each with nine Laker points dun Duncan Robinson has struggled Lo last three games he including the night would make him three for 19 from the field Davis oh he went down in a heap and the late whistle will bail him out on a on a foul by bam out of bound that's a great way to call it that's a bail out big time Anthony Davis falling down watch him loses balance here right there staggers and and B bam really is just in the way there and Coach SPO really getting after the official there he doesn't typically call a challenge in the first quarter so he's going to let that one go but that would have been one in the fourth quarter I think he would have potentially challenged just because it really looked like he he tripped and stumbled more than there was contact John this is the Lakers 38th game of the season it's the 36th game played for Anthony Davis a nine-time Allstar a first team all NBA Choice four different times right now he's the number seven score in the league at 26 points per game and he's working on a string of six consecutive double doubles yeah he's he's an impressive player incredibly versatile as a big guy at 610 playing inside and out he does this very well too which is draw fouls he gets to the line over eight times a game number two in the association in that area so you got to try to guard him as much as you can and then keep them on the perimeter and try to do so without fouling yeah he's also the fifth leading rebounder fifth in double doubles in the lead you're tied at 30 bam trying to muscle his way in against Christie he got there but he miss good attack though has to continue to look for those not rush it shoot right over the shorter defense Dalton knecht the rookie from Tennessee is in for the Lakers he was their first round pick here's kect longdistance shooting pick and roll with Davis he gets to the basket and scores oh Anthony Davis with a 12-point first quarter Lakers with a two-point lead he had eight points on three of 14 shooting the first game these two teams played he's already uh exceeded that here in the first quarter Anthony Davis Christie with a great defensive step on HZ and then Jovic return the favor defense bringing out more defense Wednesday night wrap up with a six-game road trip the heat hop to finish strong a good first quarter so far the Qui screw it in the 13 rebounds you know for sure and where with his first NBA double digit rebound game they changed some shots under the rim good D rebound by theat rookie he's making progress from these are Tower of Power Co doesn't again he's three to three from downtown tonight and it seems to be every day that he's learning something now welcome to Los Angeles heat nation and K we the Heat's first round draft pick starting to look John crate like one of the best me members of this year's rookie class love the way stepping up getting consistent minutes now in the rotation oh look at that right on Q with the block on the nine time Allstar Anthony Davis khle we says hello I think kel’el ware and Ted Ballard are our executive producer we're on the same page come in make an instant impact with a boomerang of davis' shot Alec Burks a splash down from three he just come in buries his 32nd triple of the Season change the lead for the 11th time here in this first quarter Miami's up by one and in the two3 zone defense Shake Milton is in the game for the Lakers so it's Milton and Vincent in the back court LeBron's back in for La shot clock is at four LeBron drives in and lost it got past Robinson and then he lost it and there's 3.1 left on the shot how about this recovery right here  Ke'lel Ware stepping across and using his off hand his left hand for that block keeps it in play too John the instincts that that quick lift off for K yeah I mean when you're doing that not one of the most athletic players in the game and Anthony Davis oh pretty Reverse by Gabe Vincent moved well without the ball LeBron hit him with a perfect inbounds first score for Vincent who played cged at Cal Santa barbar Herro another long three that's another one Tyler Herro making him go ooh and ah here in La better than fireworks and safer at least for us five for five shooting for Herro including four knockdowns from three a Tyler Herro with a 16-point quarter LeBron long rebound out to Jaxson Hayes Jaxson Hayes just checking in the six-year man out of Texas he's a seven footer misses the jump hook more good defense from heat rookie K dunck steps into that one but that had the look of a shot that would drop it did not noic defending LeBron gets help from here who deflects it D Vincent KES it back Shake Milton and Kell again elevating with with success yeah I love the way he grabs rebounds he goes and gets them Above the Rim he doesn't wait till they come to him using his bounce and his long arms to cral those in instant impact tonight for wear off the heat bench first heat double double this year off the bench and his first career double double on Monday night and he catches the lob and flushes it Jovic put it in the sky and and khell held up his end of the bar yeah nice Vision by Jovic there getting inside that finding that seam and then lobing it right up top letting those long arms go to work and nice work by the heat P outside and inside from long range it's Tyler Herro with the 29 ft pullup and then Jovic getting to the Jumping Jack C wear up top on top of that box heat on top by four off sale items scan that QR code right now you can purchase right now while you're enjoying the game offer valid online and in stores in the mood for for offense you're in the right spot LeBron and LeBron streaking down the lane excuse our technical problems for the moment two-point heat Le Jovic put it up there and he draws a foul so we open the second quarter here in Los Angeles the heat with a 3836 lead John Miami shot 65% in the first quarter they got seven triples and Tyler Herro with a 16-point first quarter to start this game that means he's made 13 triples this year in four quarters against the Lakers really impressive U being able to move the ball well too against this Laker defense Lakers have been able to score in the paint 22 to 10 Advantage for them they they're shooting 56% they got 12 points from Anthony Davis getting some scores on the interior but it's been Tyler Herro right there with four triples and Miami 7 threes out beyond the The Arc that that's been the difference so far Tyler her right now second in the NBA in threes with 153 triples trailing only Minnesota Anthony Edwards and last foul was on dalton knecht and Nikola Jovic did connect on both his free throws to give Miami a four-point lead just underway here in the second quar Atura and Davis the high scores in the first quarter for the Lakers as Reaves collects a triple Five Point for Austin Reams oh almost a turnover on the end bounds got to be aware when Terry Rozier is getting picked up in that back court there he'd have to hustle now to get it over the half court line Terry Rozier has got to push it a bit rir just gets it across I don't think he was aware that that he had that limitation Lakers and man-to-man defense is sizes up Breeze for the three way off rebound and knecht the rookie Here Comes LeBron seventh year as a Laker out time flies knecht and again wear like a skyscraper reaching through the LA Sky Jovic against re nice spin move Duncan goes crosscourt six on the shot clock Rozier treding to sneak it in there to wear Robinson off the tough angle and he drew a foul oh the heat get super fortunate on that sequence Shake Milton going to get called for a a foul he he would love to have back I think that's a three three-point foul too you're right Duncan should get three shots here that's a terrible foul on the corner Terry Rozier gets caught over penetrating inside tries to deliver in tight confin and this is really a desperation attempt from the corner for Duncan he gets fouled on that shot home crowd here in Los Angeles not happy folks here are booing Duncan Robinson John every time he touches it I I got news for them it's not going to help you no especially at the free throw line where he's outstanding I you know I'm hoping these free throws jump start him a little bit give him a little bit of Rhythm he has had a tough time working him himself into the offense been a rough stretch of games for recently but Shooters got to keep shooting Miami made their first 10 free throws tonight shooting 62% from the field so far wide open triple for shake Milton he missed loose ball to LeBron Reaves rips it to Dalton knecht play was in Rhythm but he missed it we ticks it to himself what great awareness by K won rebound tipped that to himself there Dalton knecht really looks to fire outside he'll take five threes a game as a rookie Jovic try to put it back for wear and instead he puts it in himself ni Jovic with four points coming off the heat bench Mi me has a six-point lead when he gets it in that DB at 610 I I think Jovich sometimes overpasses it out I'd love to see him continue to shoot inside with that length over top of usually tall smaller players no good contest on the LeBron jump shot and a fourth rebound already for heat rookie  Ke'lel Ware Johan niiko has had a a very tough game the other night in La against the Clippers went 1 for 10 made some uncharacteristic mistakes but overall he's had a very strong to oh I agree Rees rejected Duncan Robinson erased that just his fourth block of the year cut and save needs to just go right at Jaxson Hayes who he can beat off the dribble Duncan now he takes him off the bounce misses on the hook and here comes LeBron James Reaves back to LeBron and LeBron James will go to the free throw line 40 years old by the way for LeBron right now look at this rund down here by Duncan Robinson never gives up on the play Austin Reaves thinks he has an easy lay here off the backboard and Duncan extends and does so without fouling put that in the New Hampshire Hall of Fame right now you're dunking that shot block it's a good one duning Robin that was terrific effort by Duncan Robinson good first half of the heat where early second quarter the heat with a Sixpoint lead Reaves on the Move butter with the Lakers have dropped their last three games on the shot clock re short on the three Jovic with a rebound he trying to build some momentum here in the second quarter Jovic and W it's the new pick and roll combo and you got to love this Jovic at 610 where at 7 feet they are eing up to explosive offensive play just great connectivity and that's the right read Jovic drawing the big man Jaxson Hayes so he throws it up top and lets The Rook go get it  Ke'lel Ware making his presence fell early here with four points and five Boards called me this afternoon and said uh Vic and I are going to go whether you win or we win we're going to go over and give the boys jerseys uh you know he he's well aware that you know they're huge NBA fans again I I appreciate all the love and not surprise Chris did something like that JJ reic who who lost his house in the Pacific Palisades fire that was beautiful tribute by wanyama and Chris Paul to give JJ's Sons their sign game warn jerseys after Monday night Spurs win here but but reic was talking about what he and his family are going through he said the days are getting harder sadness is there it's been a logistical nightmare he said we we moved to LA and found a magical place to live and and now it's gone he and his family at the moment living in a hotel and he said the uncertainty is heavy so you can understand the the mixed emotions and and how diffusing and and debilitating this time has been for those affected by the wildfires in La scores on both ends of the Court John Miami 65% shooting first quarter in this game playing at a very high level offensively for the heat yeah when they're making threes uh it is really hard for for the Lakers to get out there and guard it leaves a lot more space to make plays like this inside and  Ke'lel Ware just getting more and more comfortable how about Jovic the way he's leading him too whether it's a bounce pass on the baseline or going up top uh with some touch in the Lop great field there by Jovic Anthony Davis Maneuvers in and miss it and Ke'lel Ware putting on a shot got points and seven rebounds already with two assists Miami with an 11-point lead this is the Heat's biggest lead of the game so far hachimura hand in the passing Lane on the steel Davis bounces back to him and it's a good foul by Duncan Robinson make him earn it at the strike but that that combination of Jovic and wear is really fun to watch yeah the two-man game on the left side of the floor and just the delivery there and then the awareness by wear inside faking and and getting Anthony Davis off balance to shoot over top and both those guys uh really connecting you know having that kind of length and skill it's very hard to to guard here's Rui hachimura 10 points in the game for him as G Vincent comes back in for for the Lakers he will who's coming out it's Vincent Reaves Christie Hachimura and Davis for the heat Herro Rozier Jovich Burks and we and another rebound for k seven rebounds in8 minutes he comes off a career-high 13 rebounds against the Clippers Monday night Jovic penetrates through the seam got it to wear again for the score so  Ke'lel Ware and niik Jovic continue to collaborate it's a 12-point Heat lead biggest of the half he still theone Davis found the good spot passed out Christie that's a three if it went it didn't and where he didn't get it but he kept Davis away from getting here's the pass on the last possession niik Jovic drawing the big man Davis and just kind of pushing it through after the initial contact to  Ke'lel Ware and heat just winning some of those hustle battles right now hamur a hard drive where he's a he's a human detour here's Jovic in the corner back to Tyler Herro at a 16-point first quarter aware threw it back out max they're guarding where with M Christie right now Herro penetrates oh through the L for Kell ball tipped out and taken by Gabe venman Reaves off the window Davis couldn't hold on but he was fouled from behind by Nikola Jovic G we making his presence felt on the defensive end here just with the shot block and then tipping that one out he continues to really impact the rim on both ends of the floor where eight points eight rebounds a block shot as Dru comes back in bam will replace Love and Jaquez will come in to replace Jovic good play from the Heats youth Off the Bench again Jovic and where that's an emerging Duo job he with a 12-point Le 536 left in a half that's Vincent and that's good a corner three for Gabe Vin averaging Four Points a game this year played 195 games with a heat uniform on including 68 starts here's Tyler bam on the top U guarded rebound comes down to Reaves the long hit ahead for Davis had the catch bobbled it out of bounds well heat will get it back the Lakers they they got off to a 10 and four start this year they have gone 10 and 13 since they're on their third three-game losing streak of the season they've been outscored their last three games by 16 points per game their coach JJ rdit called their defense the other night against the Spurs John before the game atrocious said they were not connected bam drives in and we get a foul on the Lakers so we'll be watching that Lakers defense see what kind of response they they have tonight Johnny in their three straight losses they're giv up 121 points a game yeah Miami has been able to get what they want so far shooting it outside beyond the Arc that well really helps the start though because then the defense has to come all the way out which opens up more room to operate off the dribble going in the paint Tyler here pick and roll with bam down the runway and Drew the foul and that's a great example what I just discussed the two-man game Tyler coming off a down screen and look at the defense everyone up at the three-point line three different Laker jerseys on that drop off pass there's a lot of real estate there for bam to be able to put the ball down on the floor and get on top of that r third foul on Gabe Vincent fourth team foul on the Lakers and it toppled in for bam they heat 11 of 11 from the free throw strike hey have you ever wondered what it's like to shoot a basket on Pat Riley Court at CA Center Wonder no more January 29th you can catch the game then take to the court with our postgame free throw offer scan the QR code

he he doing a good job in that two two three Zone matching up and then making uh at times two different Defenders blocking out Anthony Davis but just tiptoeing there Tyler just gets his soul on the on that sideline 62% shooting for the heat that's good seven turnovers not so much here's reeze bumping with Highsmith got the foul on the score Austin Reaves last eight games he's scoring 21 a game for La finding the open area here getting downhill Haywood getting over late and this will be the second and one opportunity for Austin Reaves as he's been forced to off that three-point line but shows he's capable in that mid-range game to get to the right hand Runner first foul on Haywood Highsmith Reaves does get the three-point play for the Lakers Lon Reaves nine-point first half for him so he lost it that time Davis on the pickup turnovers mounting for Miami eight already and Tyler takes one right back DED in front for the stei down the runway got the foul Ur you just can't stop this man tonight he's made all six of his shots he just baited this pass and then he got out and look at the footwork slows down and able to get to the Euro Step using his left hand with the 65 Reaves on his heels trying to stay plain of verticality straight Tyler gets right to his body with touch great reading of the defense and everyone on the bench getting some some love there with Tyler a perfect six for six he's got 18 making 19 points yeah you know this guy is at two straight 32p point games it's the fourth time in his career where he's strung together backto back games of 30 points are better and who knows maybe headed for another with 19 here in the first half two three Zone again for Miami they're trying to scream one of the top two guys there with Anthony Davis LeBron 0 for two from downtown in the game has five points Tyler again again and again well you probably kick the blanket right off your bed Ray on that one Tyler Herro seven of seven shooting he's made all five from three 22 points for Miami's newest Herro thank you so much will and Amy we'll see you guys at half Tyler Herro 22 points his highest scoring first half of the Season his highest scoring first half of his career 25 at Houston last season defense missing from downtown hotz with a rebound each shooting 65% as a team they got a 13-point lead and 61 first half points already they' been a great road trip for first halfs of offense for Miami I Dru darts in sends it out hot for three and the rebound finally claimed by Anthony Davis that's only his third rebound of the game Davis the number five rebounder in the League this year at 12 G Jovic checking LeBron oh the the penetration score for LeBron James he has seven points tonight the leading scorer in NBA history LeBron James the The Staggering amount of over 41,000 career points shattering Kareem Abdul jabbar's long time scoring record just crazy to see his ability to get by a much younger player with the crossover still can explode he's in his 22nd year Jaquez with a kaboom by May Jaquez Jun he's starting to to to Triple on this trip that's his first one tonight is 22nd on the year extends the Heat lead to 14 biggest lead of the game oh Hachimura with the score and the foulon bam oh no they're taking it away watch his feet here he's moving that pivot foot cuz he knows Bam's lurking right there shuffling one and then the right foot there excellent call by the official side out Miami I knew you would appreciate that call a minute 48 left here in the second quarter the heat up by 14 oh the lead for Jovic he was able to capture that six on the shot CL Highsmith lost it loose ball rolls out of bounds right in front of the heat bench the heat will left 1.8 left on the shot Cline Heat going with Jovic Herro Adebayo Highsmith and Jaquez in the awood oh threw it up lost control of it with that short shot clock and the heat will give it back to the Lakers well the turnovers have heard everything else has been terrific for Miami in this first half nine turnovers but 64% shooting minute 28 left on the has this is Max Christie he's now a Lakers starter since the trade of D'Angelo Russell to Brooklyn oh here almost picked it Christie off glass Wow points for Max Chris that zone giving the Lakers a real um pause they're they're out of flow offensively right now they've come to a a halt and not been able to get any easy baskets in transition Tyler Herro's first shot of the game comes on his eighth field goal attempt tonight made his first seven has 22 points iamy leading by 12 final minute of the second quarter Herro fronting LeBron made it a tough entry tripled on the catch Christie for Davis shot clock at four Vincent missing the thr you feel the crowd growing Jaquez with his fifth rebound of the game IE you know where he went went to his favorite spot down that lane to the rim drew the foul went right at Hachimura in transition had him back pedaling crossover and then the contact he'll go to the line for two really good hesitation move is what throws Hachimura up gets out of the stance and then the bump in the hip and that's two shots for Jaquez remember how the trip started Jaquez getting the triple double first of his career at Sacramento 16 points 12 boards 10 assists had five steals in that game played 46 minutes in the first game of that trip which feels like weeks ago it was actually 10 nights ago  Ke'lel Ware back in he'll sit down Jovic oh we got wear and adab bio on the court you know you know how much Court time they've had together this year one minute one single minute and guess what they're going to get 31 seconds that counts as a minute it's a defensive length lineup a 14-point Heatley 27 seconds left here in the first half Vincent faking the three drives in on HZ good d by where but it left Davis free 14 points for Anthony Davis this first score of this score eat by a dozen 6654 Ty given the Lakers fits tonight picking Poler bam open 15 for but he missed it and we're missing on the put back to end the first half and on this trip they heat had a 66o first half at Portland a 61-point first half in San Francisco against Golden State and a 66o first half here in Los Angeles tonight Pleasant late night viewing for all in heat Nation 66 first half points for the heat on 15 8% shooting high level performance by Miami at the end of this long road trip he turned again one of the most entertaining and compelling first halfs of offense we've seen all year Eric Reed the point guard John crate over my right shoulder John we we were both commenting on on the combination of where and Jovic they've already talked about where Jovic has had his share of Ke'lel success yeah you can never have enough Playmakers on your team and Niko Jovic provides a playmaker Off the Bench his ability to attack off the dribble he's finding where on the move as the defense rotates up and where obviously can convert but three assists for n getting the big man involved we in Port with that second unit he also scored seven points on a couple of made threes and and uh being able to get a free throw as well so good work by EO Jovic and his ability to contribute and get the big man engaged 60 plus points in three of the last five first halfs for this fast starting Heat team Tyler terrific 22 points seven of eight shooting perfect from three Jovic was impactful and  Ke'lel Ware eight points nine rebounds he did that in in just nine minutes of action Anthony Davis John got off to a good start tonight the heat slowed him down in the second quarter yeah he's a talented guy big man who's very versatile can score inside and out and he really went right at Miami in that first quarter being able uh use that length and uh got out in transition a bit too was able to stretch out and finish at 12 points in that first quarter alone you only had eight the entire game in Miami so uh he made an effort to get himself going and finish around the basket and he's been able to do that so far uh six of 12 shooting along with the the 14 points he's had three boards and a blck shot Miami got much better bench play 21 bench points to five favoring the heat by the way elsewhere in the Eastern Conference tonight Milwaukee got a 12293 victory over the Orlando Magic that moved the Bucks past the magic into fourth place in the East milwa walking now at 22 and 17 we start the third quarter here in LA with the heatah head 66- 54 Rui hachimura oh he got stuffed by the underside of the backboard and this is going to be Heat ball iy opening up with bam let's take a look at this oops got too far on that's Rozier Highsmith Herro Jaquez and adaba the Lakers Davis Lebron James Max Christie Rui Hachimura and Austin RS AZ bumped by Christie got two feet in the paint he kept Jaquez away from the rebound and here come the Lakers boy he used the pivot foot well and got a good look at a hook shot iith who had two blocks in the first half almost had that steal acha Moore in the post against her help comes acha Mo coming Baseline for the right hand Jam 14 points for a guy they acquired in a trade with the Wizards for Kendrick nun back in January of 2023 R here get a two-point first half t for two on the year averaging 12 points a game four on shot clock a long one for Tyler and an air ball for Tyler yeah one of the worst empty possessions we've seen for Miami so far this game they got stuck with that short clock Tyler having to take a much longer shot that was contested there Laker you know their coach got into them about playing better defense here in this the second half backs Christie with a three ball 10 points for Christie making his 16th start of the year in his 15th consecutive start third year man at a Michigan State from Miami's lead is seven HZ against Davis now back to Tyler got to get him cranked up again oh he had the ball fake 10 heat turnover leads to this Anthony Davis in transition he has 16 Miami lead down to five well the Lakers with the first seven points of this third quarter and in and out of the hands of bam another turnover this one will go to Herro we got a high turnover game tonight I think that's five for time yeah it is and that's the one thing with the the ball handling with this group it's been really fluid and they're and they're willing to share but we've seen higher turnovers than normal Miami typically one of the best and most short-handed uh teams in the league in regards to keeping lower turnovers but that has not been the case per se on this trip no it hasn't the turnover numbers are going up iith gets the rebound he have the ball a lead of five looking for their first score of the second half Rozier AZ for three oh it sticks for him that's a second triple tonight he's got 11 points the defense to knock it out so all of a sudden he's become a frequent contributor from downtown that's the eighth time this year he's had at least two triples in a game yeah I I just think it's really going to help his game and his confidence if he can make one or two of those a game you're going to see the defense really struggle to guard him off the dribble Christie missed it LeBron missed on the tip eight-point Heat lead Rozier open three and Bam was held and fouled this likely to go against roam first team foul first and that is the second personal on Hachimura just a a right hand clamp there on Bam's left arm and Hachimura gets caught three minutes into the third quarter heat with an eight-point lead Highsmith down the lane scooped it up missed it Anthony Davis looking deep nice athletic catch by Chris Davis no sir bam with two hands grabbing just his third rebound this this night nice pass underneath for the he Dru dunk oh the always alert bam Adebayo coming up with his third assist Heat lead pered back to double dig yeah love the way they've responded after the Lakers came on strong early in the in the third here but in the dunker spot right there Haywood Highsmith stepping across to be able to catch and finish there oh Davis gets a second shy and misses that to Rozier ripping down the rebound Here Comes Cherry good rebounding guard going to the hoop Highsmith rolls off hit both rims but would not try just under eight minutes to go third quarter Austin Reams from the tire Reaves with his second triple tonight he's got a dozen Reaves on the season averaging a career high 18 points a game undrafted after his college days at Oklahoma Tyler her into the corner Rozier back to Herro fakes Davis gets a good look but looking long it's LeBron right in front of the heat Ben for three 10 points for LeBron James that's his first triple of the night number 76 on the year for the incomparable LeBron James tough shot to Bam was all the way out there closing out to him LeBron's shooting at 39% Beyond The Arc this season Herro gets cobbled up by that Laker defense and hammered down for the foul let's see if they give him two shot shots or they say it's on the pass here they're going to say it was on the pass so it'll be side out Tyler going right into a sea of gold right here and leaning in as Reaves goes straight up and down but the contact probably from behind there no they're calling it on Reaves actually that's his fourth personal he may have to come out of the game here surely 7 minutes left third quter shot clock at eight great scene by bam Rozier gets Stripped by Davis Dives for the floor loose ball Lakers AA Moore chains for three backto back triples for LeBron and a timeout for the heat in a one-point game right over top of bam on the left wing and then again in the quick inside outside action LeBron with another triple and the Lakers right back in it here 16 to5 they've outscored Miami here in the third 22nd year in the NBA alltime lead leads all time in minutes and turnovers fourth in assists in games played fifth in triple doubles eth in steals third on the alltime list and free throw T behind only the mailman car Malone and the Big Dipper Will Chamberlain the man a future Hall of Famer he blessed us all in heat Nation with the four years he he gave to Miami four trips to the finals and the backto back championships in 2012 and and 2013 meanwhile back here in La the the Lakers have opened the quarter on a 16 to5 burst Highsmith John underline that very important score at this time of the game for and he went right at LeBron gets to the spin and he shoots it over top of Anthony Davis tough move there uh Highsmith made it look easy Haywood Highsmith nine points tonight along with two blocks the Miss three by Christie and the rebound of the Heat going with Robinson and Herro now in the lineup G bam down the runway it oh it won't count bam went down hard and they're going to call an offensive foul on bam Adebayo contact with LeBron James LeBron looks like he's a little bit hurt too his left arm he is wincing his feet were out outside the restricted area here this is a quick catch and go move and he posted it up on that left leg so he he did have the have the position there as bam hit him and probably probably the the correct call and LeBron James holding his his left arm and his elbow and he comes out of the game on Bam's third foul actually Bam's second foul it's a three-point Heat lead packed into the two3 Zone Jovic has comeing the again oh the bounce for Hachimura found the weak spot in that zone for the Baseline down yeah but Anthony Davis a great Target at that free throw line to combat that zone that's that soft area and he bounce passes it right around the backline defender there in B out bio 21 Lakers assist tonight on 29 scores to one-point Heat lead Jovic coming Baseline swings it a heist wide open three Kaboom Haywood Highsmith he'll do that to you drop him in broad daylight he's two for four from from three Haywood Highsmith with a 12-point game it's a four-point Heat lead look at Jovic defending right now trying to take away Anthony Davis from being able to catch the ball in the middle Christie oh he had the runway and gets the late whistle a trip to the free throw line David Highsmith has been a abs uh streak stopper right here the way he's been able to score when La had a g beautiful spin move there and how about the drive and kick from the corner gets the three up and those were two important baskets for Miami to kind of write the ship after the Lakers took a hard run at him John Highsmith making big buckets Jovic he he's a very creative passer he is they might not be all fundamentally sound but he's talented enough where he can contort and find a way to deliver for the ball well look you again you need Playmakers you need guys who can uh you know draw the defense and and create double teams and Jovic can do that he's got that skill Tyler can do that you know there's bam can do that there's not a lot of guys on the roster right now you know that can do that and most teams only have maybe three guys that can do that so it's important the the dimension he brings not many guys can can do that bucket after bucket 25 points he is six of eight from down down Tyler Herro putting on a show Christie missing Robinson inhales that rebound with a heat ahead by six 420 left third quarter in a strong and uplifting performance thus far for Miami great to see him compete like this final game of a six game Road Trip Jovic backing Vincent down deep and Gabe so tough minded he gave Jovic quite the battle Jovic pleading for a foul yeah really and I I really think he he may when he turned to his right there right here on this turn let's watch and look at the arms I mean this is look at I mean he's all over the wrists and arms of Jovic Nikola you shouldn't have to plead it should have been called six on the shot CL Herro catch and shoot another one 27 andu is 9 of 12 from the field tonight he he puts on an offensive Clinic almost nightm and just a great down screen to get him coming off flying that's good action there for Miami Tyler likes space and being able to catch it that close with the fade away did you say space Duncan Robinson looked like he was working for NASA he flew through space for the uncontested dunk Miami back in front by 10 and all of a sudden the crypto.com arena has gone very quiet Gabe Vincent finger rolling for two G Vincent with seven points tonight eight point he lead 320 to play third quarter Tyler Herro working on a 27-point game oh his pass intended for Christie uh intended for Jovic was kicked by Christie Herro by the way six turnovers in the game quick catch and go Duncan looks like he's going to shoot the three freezes Davis gets all the way on top of the Bas and Tyler Herro loves seeing Duncan Robinson get up on top of that Rim why not out bio comes out eight points four boards four assists  Ke'lel Ware comes back in after a really strong first half well had eight points and nine rebounds and a block in just nine minutes seven on the shot clock Herro turns it over seventh turnover on Tyler yeah that's he dribbled into a double team there that's a tough angle cuz he got pinned up against the sideline as well three minutes to go in the third Miami ahead by eight still in that two3 zone Jovic shadowing LeBron the for Hayes broken up by wear and knocked out of bounds this going be Heat ball Anthony Davis could very well be called for a foul there they're just going to give possession to Miami and there will be a foul on Jaxson Hayes well Jaxson Hayes gets the foul but he'd have the h game but he came out firing in the first quarter put the Lakers on their heels and just so efficient went seven first first seven before missing a shot and and really getting it done with range I love this ability here to get to the Euro Step and and really mix up and counter his three-point shooting cuz they're coming at him they're starting to double team him now too so he's got to make that adjustment as we head towards the end of the third quarter continue to be efficient and not turn the ball over 55% shooting for Miami tonight 54% from three that's the only thing that's hurting Miami tonight 14 turnovers joh the 14 turnovers have already led to 17 Laker points LeBron James got 13 points and five assists tonight made a couple threes in that in this third quarter 224 left in the Lakers trying to solve the zone defense the L for Hast broken up by way Davis Cashes in 18 points now for Anthony Davis John's incredible how many lobs  Ke'lel Ware is broken up in this yeah lobs and any kind of shots around the basket he is a factor inside Jovic tees up a trip on the line drive he missed it heat ahead by six under two minutes left third quarter Brown gets a screen from Davis sends back to Anthony Davis the the Twan game the Lakers rely so heavily upon 20 points now for Anthony Davis six assists for Lebron James four-point Heat lead Tyler Herro against LeBron James spinning away and knocking it in right over the top of LeBron James 29 for Herro I like it LeBron actually pointed and acknowledged him on that shot but LeBron James just amazing Vision getting downhill here look over shoulder finding Anthony Davis with the bounce and creating that lead again off the dribble inside Lebron such a A Gifted pass for Six assists so far tonight John Tyler here 29 Points 10 for 13 shooting he's tripled six times in eight attempts that's a big time moment too being able to shoot and score over top of LeBron who was giving him everything he had big smile on the face there for Tyler with 29 he he has arrived as an elite offensive player in the NBA in his six season was a 13th pick by Miami back in 2019 Jaxson Hayes Jaxson Hayes catching the lob and flushing LeBron James with a perfect set up for Jaxson has his first score of the night four-point Heat lead eight on the shot clock he Dru turns the corner and lost the ball on his way 15th turnover knecht the rookie 35 seconds left here in the third quarter LeBron 17-footer and Kell wear the long arm of wear 10 rebounds joh that's two straight Gams for Ke'lel with double figures on the glass yeah great work on the defensive blck out I like the Hustle by Highsmith to get through that screen to contest that LeBron shot there's the double team on Herro Highsmith Fric and he missed it inside that would have been nice knecht driving on Robinson ball bounces off he get back to wear for a second John 8 points 10 rebounds good enough but to do it in just 12 minutes minutes of action very impressive yeah really really is it's amazing to be honest how active he is Robinson second foul Dalton knecht we'll go to the free throw strip he was the 17th pick back in June an interesting path he took out of Henderson Colorado he went to Northeast junior college for two years then Northern Colorado for two years and as a fifth year senior had a terrific year at Tennessee at 22 points per game he was the SEC Player of the Year and wound up being a first round draft pick every player with a different path to make it to the NBA the Lakers have outscored the heat in this quarter 28-9 they're within three Dalton knecht with his first two points of this game oh the Steel by knecht got it off does not get it in so Miami gets out scored by 10 in the quarter 29-9 the heat will take a two-point lead into the fourth quarter we'll see on the other side this TV timeout powered by your South Florida our ocean Bank fourth quarter follow brings us back two nights ago when the Lakers were tied through three quarters against San Antonio and then laid an egg in the fourth quarter when they got out scored 37- 13 it was what the their coach JJ R called an atrocious defensive game and it wasn't much better for them late in that game they've lost three in a row for the third time they have yet to lose four straight and remember after a 10 and4 start to the season the Lakers 10 and 13 in their last 23 games we open the fourth quarter with a lineup of Robinson Rozier khle wear Niko Jovic and Alec Burks Rozier coming right at Gabe vinon that's that's his comfort zone going to the basket and cashing in in the paint that's the second score tonight for Terry Rozier he's only taken five shots beat ahead by four Lakers with Christie Reaves Vincent James and Hayes that's G Vince he thought the better of it when he saw  Ke'lel Ware in there Reaves comes in and a foul on Jovic who got caught behind and caught leaning in second foul on Nia Jovic first team foul of the fourth quarter on Miami got to stay down in a stance out there on the perimeter contain that ball he that two three match up with Jovich up top Reaves penetrates dotted line where sends it out what a block by Kell and a Goen and I wait that's not even a shot that was like a pass that was comical that ball was so short here he was trying to lob it it looked like to me to to Jaxson Hayes I I'm not sure about that and I think that is the proper call it was on the way down it it was definitely on the way down but the it was about 2 feet short of the rim was an air ball Jovic with the left denied by Jaxson Hayes two-point Heat lead Reaves cut off by Burks and Robinson gets it to LeBron in the corner it's fencon you could feel that one coming the Lakers with their first lead since it was 3433 with a minute and a half left in the first quarter Lakers 88 he 87 Rozier gets stri here comes Reaves he's got LeBron oh he got away with a walk and Haze with the down he need a timeout and Eric spuler takes it the Lakers on a 14-4 run to go ahead by

closed John doing it with it with her with her defense forcing 20 heat turnovers fourth most turnovers committed by Miami in a game this season oh LeBron stepped out of bounds he's claiming he was pushed by Jovic minute 35 left here in the four yeah they're going to challenge this here JJ reick uh popping off the bench saying timeout we'll challenge he's going to he thinks Jovic pushed him out of bounds there CH I think that that's that's a a good move by JJ reck for one reason only you're supporting your franchise player LeBron thought he was pushed JJ reck says Los Angeles is in the ruin of a defensive foul well it certainly is late enough in the game to use it you know the other thing I would say after a turnover you you almost want to call a timeout and just get your guys more organized and settled and take a breath um see here I you know look he he certainly contested that pass Jovic did I'm not quite sure it's hard hard from the angle to see if he made contact enough with that right arm let watch the right right arm here I don't see much of a push pretty minimal not conclusive enough Trey Maddox John Butler on the heads checking it out in in concert with the replay Center in sakas New Jersey the heat Nation thank you so much staying up late to root for your team right to the finish of this six game Road Trip heat Nation we we appreciate you we know we're speaking to the best fans that he'd have right now Miami 54% shooting but the 20 turnovers we're about to get a ruler dur a review is observed that there is illegal contact to the left side of LeBron James's waist this is a proximate foul because of the out- of bounds ring La gets their timeout back and the ability to challenge again we have 136 on the game clock it will be Lakers ball on the side Jovic still not buying it I don't blame him man 36 left Lakers in front 115 to 106 he scor 66 points in the first half right now John just 40 points here in the second half mandatory need a stop here

Lakers will just take time off the clock trying the Lakers earn this Victory coming from behind in the second half to win they were down 12 at the half they controlled the second half of this game that beat Miami and they will split the season series each team winning at home the Lakers will improve to 21 and 17 and the heat will fall to 20 and 19 and the road trip will finish for Miami with three wins and and three losses Brown James comes out he hears it from the the Laker fans 20 22 points nine assists five rebounds Anthony Davis also coming out 22 11 boards four assists for him that J the Tyler Herro cooled off a little bit the turnovers persisted 20 turnovers for 23 points too much to overcome yeah he became you know pretty one-dimensional with Tyler herro being the spark offensively and and the Lakers were able toar up on him a bit more and force those turnovers so many more field goal attempts favoring the Laker side uh with all those turnovers and then how about LeBron James at age 40 really finishing the game with three resounding scores to pull the Lakers ahead at the end Still The King LeBron James 22 points tonight and Gabe Vincent he hurt the Heat tonight he had 14 points seven came in the fourth quart Austin Reaves played a role 14 points for Reaves he also had a season High actually not a season high he had 14 assists along with his 14 points
