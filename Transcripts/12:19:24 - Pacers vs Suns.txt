 the fellas are back to work in downtown Phoenix and eager to throw it in overdrive with a hethy roster and hunger to make up for lost time that opportunity comes tonight in the form of the Indiana Pacers who roll into town it's the Suns and the Pacers here on Arizona's Family Sports welcome inside footprint Center gang tonight you join us I got the smoo shooter Eddie Johnson I'm Kevin Ray we'll check in with Amanda flugrad here shortly well e Devin Booker had said early on don't sleep on Tyus Jones ability to score the ball and the veteran packed the point guard has been backing that up of late yeah like no surprise to me I mean I saw enough of him as a backup to know if he got starters minutes what he would do he is he's just uncanny man look he can score the basketball I think a lot of people ignored it because they were so enthralled by his assist to turnover ratio they didn't realize that this young man can flat out get the spots on the floor he has excellent three-point range he is in a great Rhythm right now and his teammates are pushing him to be even more aggressive because the more aggressive tyus Jones is the better it is for Kevin Durant uh Devin Booker and Bradley Beal to get one-on-one coverage yeah last five games shooting better than 50% from Beyond The Arc and he said early on also about feeling out process getting to know his new team well he is certainly looking 3 five get rolling it creates a tital wave of problems for the opposition and they know exactly how to create the gravitational pull over their teammates to open the floor and create scoring opportunities in all spots on the floor with the holidays fast approaching Booker and Kevin Durant are in the spirit of giving and are focused on giving an L to the boys from India it's a son that Pacers in a Thursday night track very dear member to us and a Man simply known as van to both the players those of us in the organization family members and even the fans and E know for you you had much more of a personal relationship with Van I did not have The Good Fortune of watching him play here I saw lots of highlights I know what he meant to me but I know there's a special memory of van for well the original son uh that just says a lot right there uh but his impact was throughout this organization uh as a player uh as an as an analyst uh working with Al McCoy and then as someone that worked in the front office I mean he was a basketball Savant he loved basketball he loved actually to be a part of it and I think that was the key for him uh but a tremendous basketball player uh University of Indiana first and then getting to the NBA and as you see a lot of his stuff was the kind of game that we missed right the mid-range stuff getting to the rim uh very aggressive uh all of those things hair flying around them uh and then obviously he and his brother Tom are twins and obviously our prayers go out the Tom uh who lost a guy that was born just a little bit I think before him I believe and uh so we're going to miss uh dick he was a tremendous individual Yeah you mentioned it too versatility you saw it on the floor you saw it with all the roles that he played with the organization and uh a very dear member of the Suns family rest in peace Legend Phoenix Suns basketball beautiful night in downtown Phoenix as we walking me inside the footprint Center and catch you down to the Pacers and your Pacers they come with a record of 12 and 15 4 and 11 on the road led by tyrese haliburton and the Olympian Andrew Nembhard Bennedict Mathurin Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner for the Suns well that starting five is back Tyus Jones a four-time All-Star Devin Booker three-time Allstar Bradley Beal 14 time all-star Kevin Durant and the Bosnian Beast Yousef Nurkic for more on Tyus Jones let's swing it over to Amanda Tyus Jones continues to be a consistent sces for this Sun's team as he's currently coming off a 19point performance against the Blazers in which he was also a perfect three for three from a Beyond The Arc and I was able to talk to him the other day just his overall mental approach and what he does going into a game and how he's not able to get too high or too low and he said the biggest thing for him is being the point guard is he wants to be a leader out there I'm just trying to stay steady he said as a guy who's out up front the team is obviously going to go how you go so I want to set the home for always being even Keel never getting rattles I just try to stay steady show up do my job each and every night and hopefully that rubs off on the rest of the guys out there that certainly has thank you Amanda 19 points in the game on Sunday age at five straight games with three plus threes and boy he's smiling we're all smiling when number three is back on the floor for the Suns yeah it's good to see Bradley Beal back out there uh and you know look he got an opportunity to get some serious rest and not miss a lot of games and so thankful for the uh NBA cup and allow Bradley Beal to get the needed rest to get back on the court Turner and Nurkic jump it up and off we go great match up here with Kevin Durant and Pascal faka tight pass inside beautiful dime from Durant inside to Booker and Nembhard is a guy that will harass you defensively and so that was an excellent move for Devin to get wide open early well that postup game pay dividends right there you can see the way he was able to seal off inside the paint Siakam trying to go to work on the fade there ninth year he's coming off a 22 two- Point outing in that win Sunday against New Orleans one of the best back to the basket players in the game so Kevin Durant knows he has to do a better job of not allowing him to get that deep of position there Canon off the booker quickly sees the double team Nurkic is inside has a Mitch Match and able to get the soft touch up and in Nurkic is always conscious of running someone over and picking up a charge heart snakes along the Baseline well he can do this right here all day long but I think you want to give him that especially if it's an air B indeed yeah out the red carpet for shots like that he is to your point though shooting 41% on the season Jones on the drive and kick extra pass sets up Durant with a straightway look to strong Beal there for the offensive rebound bar doing what he does well very good on his offensive play book goes on the attack deart able to jar it free drops it off to Nurkic W get that one back up into the hands of Siakam heel making contact there on the drive with maen that's all boy that is nothing but leather there I think I think BOS kind of nervous to do that early in call it early in the game cuz he lost one last game that he thought he had Bennedict Mathurin uh obviously injury cost him last year in their run in the playoff and he is an excellent basketball player and he's the kind of guy that Haliburton needs to get off offensively to take the pressure off of him yeah it was out from March 9th to the end of the season with that torn right laum and despite that this team still made an incredible run but their offensive numbers have taken a pretty significant dip so far this season well again teams have gotten used to the way they play lob up top Nurkic finishes off nice screen there from Devin himart kicks it back outside now to Haliburton his play has improved over the last several games after a slow start Mathurin swings it across the Nembhard will fire the three he's shooting just 25% on the season doesn't matter when teams play us though they seem always get a good Rhythm speaking of red carpet Booker rolls it out in a run to the rim B get to the 15t range suns are going to get a ton of open looks in this game Collision there with Mathurin as Booker misses the three-point attempt wh so came late and immediately reaching down with that ankle and everybody in the arena leans up on the edge of their seats they will take a look at this one for the potential of a reckless close out for video review r that's a that's a flagrant yeah look it's not egregious it's not on purpose but you know as a Defender you just cannot do it you have to allow that shooter to come down in their Landing Zone and if you don't you're going to be penalized for it with with obviously a foul and maybe an extra free throw on top of that on review the play has been upgraded to a flagrant foul penalty one as there was a reckless close out and the defender walked under him causing a Booker to land on his foot three shots our crew chief Rodney M the rest of the officiating crew tonight JT or and Matt CIO so three free throws coming here for Booker foul on Maan see Sunset coach like buer yeah players are forgetting that it's three free throws in the ball yeah and there you see R Car second time around win of the title with the Mavs doing a tremendous job what a lonely place at the free throw line you all by yourself and you got to take three I was a you know High 80% shooter from the free throw line and I tell you I did not like shooting technical fou I I just didn't get a look at our health update brought to you by Banner Health official Healthcare partner of the Phoenix Suns and you love that list because there is not a single member of the Suns team on there tough loss right now there neith out this is a team that's lost two their big men to Achilles injuries Jones getting past Turner boy he is just become lethal with that drive to the basket takes it off the glass young players when you're driving toward the basket the way to take and help your touch is to kiss it off the glass I mean it's just a basic shot oh what do you say that square is there for a reason not decoration that touch pass sets up be down it goes 90 run has pushed the Suns in front 157 games are going to start coming a little more frequently what the sons have seen the last two or three weeks Turner tries his hand at a second three-point attempt this one hit it's the net he's not going to stop shooting no he is one of the better shooters from that area for his side Pacers knocked down 16 of their 38 attempts in the game on Sunday Kevin Durant can knock down the Baseline jumper Here Comes Haliburton teammate of Booker and Durant and Summer Olympics rather strong drive inside and little too strong Alber long arms able to get a hand on that redirects it out of bounds but the early three ball helping the Pacers stay close son really getting all the looks that they want n took a peek inside nothing there finds Durant on a run and brings the Boom that'll prompted timeout from Rick Carlile going to Pacers with the Suns in front 1710 Kevin Durant on the move not standing and being rewarded time now for the Mountain America Credit Union the exclusive home of the Suns card book went scorched Earth against these Pacers yeah look it's is kind of game playing with the Pacers they want to push Tempo so if you get up and down the court and get to your spots you're going to get one-on-one coverage which to me is suicide for any bodyguard and Devin Booker but also you're going to get wide open shots as well because they they go back with an unbalanced floor at times and you just have to make them pet do to them what they want to do to you they're going to try to run it down your throat you got to turn around and push it on them as well Sun's off to a hot start 64% from the field saw there seven assists on seven made field goals screen for mine can't connect on the wide open jumper M average just about 17 points per game a peek inside the field but couldn't get it there in time Kevin Durant the Baseline pull up just off the mark struggle a bit from the field on Sunday M miss a second one there he is Jones Pass little too much high heat on that one for the Phoenix turnover well crosscourt pass and it has to be high and it has to be fast because it will get picked off a little too high for Devin on that one Nembhard finds Haliburton brings it back to Turner squares and fire straight away listen he's the best three-point shooter okay so you know you just and that's his spot so that's why he's up there he wants you to leave him but he has been unconscious for three Beal on the drive but we're going to get an offensive foul called both Turner and tiak both over 40% and they've taken I think the second and third most on the team so it's not like they're not taking the three that foul was on Nurkic Haliburton kind of hesitated for a second and loads it up and two strong with that offering yeah that archaic shot really is effective for him when he's in the groove when he's missing able to handle the low pass tton with a double double they game on Sunday Booker off balance Elbo jumper no no O'neale makes his way to the scores table Siakam could work another mismatch Jones with the quick hands nearly had the steal swings it out to Haliburton the high arching three and that is the fifth made three here in this opening quarter on nine attempts and Suns had a 90 run early and the Pacers have countered one of their own here to take a two-point Advantage p on three B on the drive kicks it out to the open shooter Jones but a travel so backto back Turtles for Phoenix's Booker is looking back at Rodney M trying to get an explanation where the travel came no minute restrictions for Bradley but but just saying team wants to be smart about it seven minutes into books for him two rebounds three assist Nembhard drive to the basket and that will get a timeout from bud and the Suns as the Pacers 11 a run four point lead from my childhood but Di Van Arsdale is actually one of them uh I saw that maybe his last year was 1977 so I was very young I was only eight and uh but remember Tom and Di Van Arsdale and um you know just a great player great human um you know great great for our organization great for our city um our thoughts and prayers with his family and his friends cornito shot worth taking you see the numbers R van fourth in games played third in total minutes second in free throws and sixth in points and of course kind of fitting to to hear from bug the basketball family that he grew up in his love for the son organization her hits the de Kevin Durant on the drive Nurkic there to scoop it up in the save O'neale's got it shot clock at five though Jones recognizing touch pass O'neale Corner look no Obe toppin checked in during that last timeout and he walks into the three-point attempt and the three ball is the Money Ball here early Pacers are six of 10 from Beyond The Arc two of five on two-point shots in it's de 14o run as Booker on the drive and aert heads up play there by Booker felt the contact heard the whistle got the shot toward the iron and he'll head to the three line suns have to recognize that that's the first look in the is G that's what they're going to do so you got to be a little bit closer defensively to be able to at least challenge somewhat that's just the way they're going to play and you got to be conscious of it and they're not going to stop regardless if they missed 8 10 in a row they're going to keep shooting and was ruled a non- shooting foul as Oso checks into the game O'neale able to handle BRS it across to Jones on a three-point attempt long rebound there to track it down time to work on the clock here extra pass sets up Jones for the corner dagger he not missing that final shot he's like PJ Tucker reincarnated PJ Tucker like he must have rented out that space couch over there little TV little refrigerator what surely there's a Poore maker right yeah Nembhard cut off by Jones forces to pull up racing out of the floor drop off in heavy traffic top it there to scoop it up Haliburton finds nart and that's what they do well and you see they're always getting the ball quickly to Haliburton cuz they know he's a tremendous decision maker and they like to score and he likes to pass Haliburton stretching out the defense Oso on the roll Suns making that extra pass shot clock at five once again booker alert with the basketball hears the whistle non shooting foul that'll be the third team foul here on Indie hook has gotten fouled the only person that's gotten fouled and it's never leading to two free throws Oso cross over sets up Jones skip pass O'neale left wing three got it Royce elevated himself so Devin could see him with a direct pass R is 23 of 38 from Beyond the AR last five game Suns forc a Miss pass across to Jones does a nice job of handling grayon one of the three oo wasn't ready for the pass but Ro O'Neil did the right thing alsoo always got to keep his eye on the guy with the ball Sheppard who makes his return tonight cuts to the Lane gets the easy basket so Mcconnell and Haliburton out there together they're a problem because now you got two very good passers on the floor and TJ of course an irritant on the defensive end Grayson fir from the corner Monte Morris head the score his taable just under two minutes here in this opening quarter Saka leans inside face after kind of a slow start they are definitely in a rhythm over the last 5 and 1/2 minutes looker abl to drive his way inside pass McConnell for the tough two was a bumpy road to get to the rim but Devin found his way he'll get a whistle and a foul called away from the ball that'll be chars on O'neale as Tas will take a seat Monte Morris checks in Haliburton will also sit down as M will step back on the floor here with the Pacers well it's a double foul really just War them hey guys clean it up like you know it doesn't make any sense to call the double foul right there Sheppard with a corner three won't get it and we've got a foul called on it's amazing how the paces have gotten to the Penalty before the sun seems like they've been fouling more they only have three team f Toppin in his Fifth Season the only Pacer to play all 82 games last year they average about almost not quite 124 points per game last season when they kind of caught Everybody by surprise flying up and down the floor but they're scoring differential almost nine points fewer here so far this season pass inside of the cutting Allen finds Oso five on a shot clock deep straightaway three cover over Booker and the Pacers have also really Stu up and extended their defense last 5 and A2 minutes Siakam backing down on O'neale gets the turn around of the paint that's a shot he rarely misses Booker on the drive gets inside left hand and here learn two shots at the stripe too Booker averaging just over seven free throw attempts per game as we get a message from our friends at Jack and box the best rated Burger in fast food with more beef than a big Mathurin keep up Ronald welcome to Jo the the 10 of 12 in the game on Sunday that's his fifth game this season with 10 plus free throw attempts and he is well on his way there again for a five start here tonight 10 points lead the Suns of scoring but a trail by five here final 37 seconds Mcconnell inside Allen great defense and lost by Walker yeah too too little time for a two for one you just want to work your way for a good shot get back balance defense Boer waiting for the Allen screen able to get to that left hand and creates a beautiful open Lane with the assistance of the rookie igodo K has found out that he can get to the rim he has been very conscious of putting the ball down and being Ultra aggressive yeah very few jumpers thus far from Booker as McConnell trying to beat the clock comes up short with that one one quarter in the books here inside footprint and it sees the Pacers in front 3229 you're watching Phoenix Sun's basketball on Arizona's family sports.com or the NBA app using your NBA ID go now help send your Phoenix Suns players to Allstar 2025 Pacers got out of the gates hit six of 11 threes taking another one here as Mathurin can't download that one though yeah see if uh Kevin Durant can get it going one of four in that first 10 Nurkic on the roll and a reach in there called on Jarace Walker seconde player out of Houston Miracle head to the stripe coming off his seventh double double of the season 14 rebounds and you know if you're Nurkic right uh the rebounding should be the first thing on your book right okay I got to get double F rebounds second thing is I got to make good catches right and cuz when you make good catches even if you missed a shot you still have a balanced floor right they turn it over they knock it away and all of a sudden they got number numbers going the other way first and foremost that we saw last year with him when he's rebounding the ball everything else pretty much blow yeah Kevin Durant Taps to himself Kevin Durant stole the rebound from Kevin Durant says I need to get myself going has two quick fouls to start the second quarter here as Siakam steps out making contact he's asking Katie what do you want me to do what is it you would like me to do uh Katie's like uh don't defend me that hard I mean you want to be honest back up a foot or two yeah just back up give me the three and give me a clean shooting pocket you know over make it a list is the holiday season Ryan stepping out back tap there by Nurkic but into the hands of Bryant Thomas Bryant coming over via trade a guy that Rick Carlile has always admired and they needed some backup big help as McConnell tied up won't get that one tapped out last Touch by the Pacers well Suns defense has picked up here and he's getting one shot Pacers won an early timeouts 1047 to go here second quarter one-point game here in downtown Phoenix 31 Pacers leading these Suns early second quarter here in downtown Phoenix and it's time for the money Drive delivered by First Bank First Bank thanking for good number FDIC congratulations now Booker has gone from jump shot Booker to put it in overdrive that's what he did look watch this first scen and then oh so what you do is stick to your guy let Devin handle the one-on-one cover there just don't allow that big guy to come over and be a deterrent look for the Suns nine assists on their 11 made field goals Bradley Field checks back into the game something happened to the basketball man I hate that though if they did change that ball I didn't notice it they were talking about it that drive me nuts cuz you get used to touching the ball like early even before the game you go over and touch it then they change it well and and you know immediately right yes cuz you develop a field for that ball and and so it's the newer ball is a little bit more slippery second travel call and Sun's penetrating to the basket yeah right now that's the one of the issues that's kept the door open here for the Pacers that is turnover number six for Phoenix Indy has scored nine points off of that aners have cooled off though they have missed their last six shots until that three-point hit seven of 13 He is their best three-point Sho about 42% yeah approaching 43% on the season for Siakam 22 and 5 of the game on Sunday Kevin Durant trying to get going and maybe that'll do it that should have been an and one as bud with arms extended and Kevin Durant looking at the official who is right behind him cuz he normally doesn't shoot the ball that quickly he felt that he had to get it up because he felt he got five back to back triples they come out of a timeout whatever Carlile said to them I guess the magic worked yeah we missed six straight they were all inside the arc go back outside Siakam showing off the defensive chops there gets the steel maen hit one three had to walk into another one yeah that was one on none I tell you old school coaches from back in the day they'd be going crazy right now yeah you can hear that grably voice of cotton in your ear I know Morris on the drive tackled up by McConnell and a reach in foul called on TJ McConnell that'll get Monte Morris to the line con got the worst of that that's why he came down hard on his arm TJ is one of the tough physical guys but Monte Morris is as well 10 years in the association for TJ McConnell undrafted out of Arizona and well what a great honor for him inducted to UFA basketball Ring of Honor Wednesday joining his teammate Mathurin a whole team joined him down there for the ceremony so really touching event for TJ his friends and family is we remind you you can shop the latest City Edition merchandise designed by local artist fats have yours today by visiting the phix Suns team shop or buy online at shop. suns.com conell trying to get loose to the Baseline Morris great defense a delay whistle comes and Morris a look of disbelief that's McConnell's move he'll drive Baseline he'll drive Baseline and then he gets to the other side and he's really good at pulling up for a jump he all he plays like a big man he doesn't take a ton of wide open threes he doesn't take a ton of shots past 20 ft but in the paint he is very good at getting a shot up over people finished seventh in the Sixth Man of the Year voting everything about 20 minutes per game this year 11 points yeah look he's only taking 14 threes all year so you already know that he's trying to get to a sweet spot fivepoint Pacers lead ran outside Siakam running at him somehow slipped the pass through the keyhole and Bradley Beal delivers the three-point strike Siakam pulls for three tapped up and around once twice that's why they went out and made the trade for Bryant picked him up from Miami Durant with Siakam making contact the whole way he'll hit the pull up nonetheless that's say he needed he just needed people to knock him around going be a little angry Jarus Walker responds with the Baseline J Morris wide open look prior 10 games good little coold spell here the last three plus games Allen forcing the turnover Kevin Durant in transition but there's those active hands of McConnell Siakam flies in for the slam that's 14 points on eight Phoenix turnovers Siakam was very good though at what getting his hands up in the passing line you got to be careful Nurkic doing a little ballet move gets the contact the finish and the foul oh that was definitely SL slow motion but it's smart because when you go slow motion at a Defender you throw off his rhythm and his cence that's exactly what happened to Bryant fresh bodies to the floor here for Rick car's Club is Haliburton Toppin and Myles Turner all checking back in here well high scoring game normally they are high scoring games when you are playing against the Indiana Pacers 729 left and 44 42 game yeah these two teams averaging identical points per game 114 and change as Nurkic completes the three-point play out ER already flirting with his eighth double double 9 point6 rebounds sheer will check back in Mard getting the screen from Top it swings it out straight away he hits I just don't know if you going to just switch that I'd like to see Mard just go ahead and see if he can take Nurkic cuz you're leaving Toppin right there and he's a very good shooter that pass sails beyond the reach of Beal and that is turnover number nine Pacers conversely just three turnovers IND theana averaging about 15 and the Suns done a great job there number nine in the league just 13 not quite 14 turnovers per game Haliburton noish inside to Turner and a whistle and a foul it'll put Myles Turner at the line will pick up the personal I'll check that Monte Morris will pick up the foul that is his second see the numbers on Turner for the season 70 quite 72% set KN it's the pair six-point lead Sun's led by eight early biggest lead's been seven good to see this guy back after a couple of game absence with the swelling of the knee the rant with Nembhard break all over it gets the redirect and hits the pull up Lucky bounce back to Kevin was another turnover Turner thought about pulling a trigger on the long three top it'll put on the deck the left hand drive won't get the Finish but will get the foul and butd is asking I think rightfully so it's like you're going to give a whistle on that move but you look at how hard Durant had to do to shake free from Nembhard just to get that as Booker and Tyus make their way back to the scores table well signs can be thankful that they're just down five based on the way the Pacers have shot the ball from three lights out they plus 15 from three well plus 15 from three and they're plus 14 in points off turnovers y should be thankful but you know when you're shooting 57% and 40 from three you just got to look at it and say you know what if we do the things you just said take care of it it's a different ball game Durant with a hesitation Tyus pulled for three won't get it top and flies him for the rebound I think Brad's got to take that shot I mean he's being very unselfish and I get it he is uncanny from there as well Nembhard across to the open shooter he'll be top it no Sheppard with a hustle play salvages the offensive rebound gets the corner look je trying to W his way back as Durant slips there fortunately stays upright b gets the mismatch with Turner onto him the crossover jammed up scooped up up the floor and toen a little duncker's Delight from Obi Toppin his father oadi nickname and that's 14-2 fast break points I don't know if what car likes that one of these days that Ball's going to flip out of his hand he better make sure he doesn't do it when the game's on the line Beal slicing to the basket lost it on the follow will get the finish and the foul oh I don't understand that I tell you please bring back the N1 like I just don't understand how he can judge that what do Bradley Beal going to do I mean just take a look at this okay loses the ball grabs it and he goes up now how is that I for the life of me I just don't understand and how he says he wasn't Gathering he was gathering on that it it's just too quick Rodney M too quick on that that was he was going straight up to shoot the ball this just too quick yeah it'll put the Suns in a bonus but that Bradley you can see looking and in disbelief I mean officials are very good but the players are extremely fast and for him to believe that he wasn't gathered to shoot what else was he going to do well and I know that this has been near the top of your list for the suggestion box but yeah I I would I would continue to to bang that drum because I think with today's athletes especially and their ability to finish off contact yeah and my thing is okay if you're not going to call it on the perimeter in regards to that and I get it guys are very creative and they get the hit and they go up and shoot fine but but why don't we just have a rule where if you got two feet in the paint you say restricted area and you going up then it's it's old school way of calling an n one because it's just hard to gauge Alber in quiet half thus far it's only taking two shots three points O'neale gathers on the Pacers Miss Kevin Durant slithers inside won get the floater Siakam there to scoop it up quick pass up the floor Mathurin the look to Haliburton that higher marching awkward three-point attempt not like anything else they're going to go through stretches where they can't make it and that's when the Suns need to seize the opportunity Jones sees the opening Kevin Durant on the drive and that is the third or fourth time that Kevin Durant has hit the deck off the defense is Obi Toppin inside and we're going to get a technical foul called on bud and understandably so Timeout on the floor 404 to go in the half prin Center make you smile moment brought to you by Studio B SMyles the screen and winner let's take you back to Allstar Weekend February 1995 congratulations Sir Charles sha the big shakas gr H Mitch Richmond MVP now here you go a trivia for you each which player was not in the 1995 allstar game that's a tricky one because you see Dana barl down there you think that he wasn't but I think he was I think that's the year he played very well if I'm not uh I would probably say Tyrone hit that's your final answer Chris Weber that's probably cuz he was injured you didn't tell me that or as uh Sophie I believe called him Chris Weber in the pregame show wow tells how old she is Tom and Tom had some fun with uh so fun the pregame show tonight but it was an inside job as they tried to take TC down you get a shot of uh but you got you got to give me credit though for the uh Dana barel cuz most people would have said Dana barel right right yeah my boy that was my boy say that was my boy see a connection I knew he had that really great year Pacers with their biggest lead they got the technical free throw coming out of that timeout as Kevin Durant squares and fires son's got to put on a nice 340 right here I mean just take care of the ball and you're back in the game that's all it is cuz the shooting is there Nembhard on the Drive Allen will be whistled for the foul and this is he's on one tonight I'm going to tell you that right now and Devin Booker is asking Rodney M what what's happening on the other end of the floor because that is exactly the the move that Kevin Durant has made three or four different occasions and has not gotten watch he beats the whistle he beat him to the spot play on Haliburton on the drive swings it around O'neale cutting off the shooting pocket of Nembhard forces him into the contested 15ot that shouldn't happen out the Siakam long rebound snared there by Allen take care of the ball sons have shot the ball extremely well Booker on the rolls got Nembhard in his waistband Booker inside well at this point you just get the feeling the suns are going to have to buckle up and play through the contact that is coming as Durant fighting off Siakam Allen a to scoop it up look to the left hand drive inside we'll get the whistle and a foul looking to add to his 14 points here in the first half so what bud is going to talk about it half time every time down we're getting good look getting to the basket getting open shots but we're jumping and trying to pass we're trying to make the difficult pass instead of the hockey assist and if you can do that you're going to find yourself with a 10 15 run and that's key knocking down the first as we remind you it's time to nominate your Latin owned business for the 2425 L Sun small business MVP presented by First Bank unlucky business will receive $5,000 plus promotional nition across Sun social media and more learn more at suns.com empowerment awards today sounds have climb their way back numerous times in this first half after being up early let's make this last time continue to climb like K KR goes up Camel Back Mount don't stop halfway up can't stop half well missed three there for the Pacers now N9 of 23 in the game but five more than the Suns have been able to connect on Grayson season opening with a pullup met by Turner franchise leader in blocked shot for got too close Indiana gra just got too close you know pull up right there 10t and take your shot you Turner is one of the best shot blockers in the game well this is a Pacers team you look at their record each 12 and 15 they're 4- 11 on the road but they've got some quality wins this season they've knocked off the Celtics they've beaten the Mavericks they beaten the magic and they beat the Knicks they just have not been able to find the overall Rhythm and consistency though they come in here winning three of their last four again they're a streaky team because of the way that they play and when they catch fire they're devastating couple the free throws from Turner Booker able to get the left hand again drives inside finds Tyus the corner look Siakam the rebound quick push up to floor to Haliburton these really kind of look to play facilitator just three field goal attempts that Suns will be happy try to facilitate there as he turns it over but just the fourth Pacers turnover to the Suns 10 yeah that's the time when I think Tyus has to say okay give me the ball you know let me settle us down right again the stuff right like right there with with Nembhard doing that son hav gotten those calls well little dribble of hesitation trying to set up Haliburton goes right past it sets up grayon in the corner three can't hit it just four of 12 from Beyond The Arc need some help here's Mathurin puts it on the deck tough Drive challenge there by Plumlee Grayson on the push another a minute to go on the drive scoop inside to mace kicks it out to the open shooter O'neale Mas love love good foul like right there underneath the basket Suns just one of six from Beyond The Arc here in this second quarter Siakam with a pullup left shorts had a two for one opportunity bypassed it BS going to full Turner out on the perimeter crosses him up on the drive and kick O'neale corner three splash down Suns needed that right got to get it to Haliburton with the side step three to close out the half for the Pacers Suns will get one crack at it reload for Roy with the three-point hits at the horn backto back triples from D zero and makes it a one-point game here at the half inside footprint 60 to 59 Pacers in front stay tuned now for the Healer River Resorts of casinos half time Report with Tom Leander Tom Chambers and Sophie Cunningham you're watching Phoenix on basketball on Arizona Family Sports the exclusive home of the halime here in downtown Phoenix the visiting Pacers in front 60 259 before we get this third quarter started though let's send it over to Amanda with threes from Royce O'neale to close out that first half how do you continue with that momentum and generating some of that energy to start the second half yeah thank God he get that shot cuz it feels better walking into the the locker room Amanda uh really for us right now we've got to stop turning the ball over cuz when we get a chance to shoot at the basket it's gone pretty well for us so if we can get our turnovers under control I think we'll be in better shape you mentioned the turnovers is that something that you guys I mean is it kind of what the defense is doing against you guys out there or just a matter of taking better care of the ball it's a little bit of everything you know tip our hat to them they're active their hands are active we can make some better decisions stop playing in in crowds and uh probably improve some spacing in a couple situations but like I said no matter how we do it we've got to get the turnover out of the game Chad thank you so much thanks Amanda thank you Chad thank you Amanda and yeah I mean he spot on you were talking about it e you look at the disparity with the turnovers 18 points off of the 10 Phoenix turnovers just two points for the Suns off of the four turnovers and quick turnover Force there by Nurkic the hands finds a driving Bradley feel for the easy two of the Suns back in front hey Bradley got them big top-notch breaks man I mean he can stop right on the DI Imart no look pass inside to Siakam able to gather and will get the and one opportunity that's funny right I mean Bradley in first half he got fouled down there and they said he wasn't shooting think Siakam may give it to him that's it's exactly what Bradley is talking about with the outside official that's what I say it's just it's just a play that they they just need to get rid of right he fou him right there before he went up he actually hit his hand before he was going up the shield and that's exactly what Bradley did in the first half in the exact same spot yes you know maybe they went in halftime and saw Brads and said that was a mistake so they corrected it oh well I mean oh oh thank you thanks for checking his TI is Five Points four assists whistle and a foul charged onak that'll be his second he bail tius out on that one I don't know if de would have caught that hand shot 52% from the floor in the first half Nurkic loses that one on the way up yeah got to go up with two hands young fell there's Mathurin as you can see a couple times now Nurkic has jumped out trying to disrupt their offensive flow here's Haliburton quiet first half but turns into facilitator there gets his sixth assist Al alurn has the ball you've got to be wary of him drive inside shot blocked from behind Sun's able to recover deep three off Jefferson for Booker long rebound to the hands of Siakam six of 17 from Beyond The Ark Nembhard extra pass from Siakam to Turner the three-point hit such a beautiful shot got his side run and Durant responds with a three-point hit of his own not as pretty as that pretty pretty first three point knocked out of the knights the 35 turned on the cat it shoot three no long rebound trickles into the hands of Siakam on the turn too strong to the left hand Suns on the push triling Durant touch pass Nurkic smart move by Nurkic right there TR to roll and reset but Turner with the long arms knocks it away Haliburton loads up the long three again look sons have to stop making a pass off the dribble they are EX with their hands they always got their hands up and they get deflection Jones on the drive boy T finished there but couldn't get the end to go as Mathurin on the drive knocked Away by Booker and Booker is saying that is our ball and Booker is waving the finger and Bud got the confirmation with the bench and the suns are going to ch Gallen here trailing by seven 926 to go here in the third we want to say a big hey to Mr MC giblet and family watching the sons game all sponsored by Valley Chevy dealers for your chance to be featured on the broadcast post your photo with a hash couchs side ban M Giblin Mr MC Giblin man that's a basketball name right there and here you go the call on the floor of the time was Indiana basketball the Suns then Mathurin when she could ATT tack for saying that it was off on somebody else you know when a player driv to distort in official need to get why not the Suns with a challenge and keep the challenge no the challenge for the sun to take care of the ball that has been a major challenge so far tonight Kevin Durant on the jab step Spin and score 15 of the night for Durant and 20 of the win Sunday against Portland Turner thought about the three the first time on the reset Miss fires yeah the reset got him in trouble going to get defensive 3se second violation charged as Myles Turner trying to play the paint game dipping that foot in and out of the paint to try to buy the time that will put Booker back at the free throw line it's one of the things too people are talking about maybe the NBA should get away from that call right and just allow a Zone you know I have no issue with it because I don't think a team can stay in a Zone a long time against an NBA quality team anyway right and so you rarely going to see it let's go Jones on the drive kicks it pass there to the corner to Beal Beal back after a two game absence hits the 15 footer he's got a dozen see BR a little aggressive here you know when you got all three of them being aggressive hard for the Pacers to even help defensively he shot the ball well well yeah to your point be aggressive because he's perfect in the field but they just continue to drill the three ball 13 on 29 attempts pass across to be on the drive attacking Turner and without respect Bradley Beal look got Myles Turner two-time NBA block champ and Bradley says take this grab with 14 points it's a good foul there just a step late in running out at Turner okay that's I for those the paces anytime they get fou they're gathered I get it start calling them gathered Paces that's a good drive right there conr so here's the foul so whistle right there no gather it was no gather whistle is right there no gather he takes a step and a half and he's 12 ft from the basket yet that is deemed a shooting foul like I said it's it's one of the most it's the hardest call for officials to make I'll give them credit but it never was a hard foul when they allowed you one extra dribble as you if you were going to the basket and going to shoot the ball I I just for the life of me I that's the one rule that I just hated that the league changed because it takes away the beauty of finishing right how many miraculous unreal shots we've seen with the normal and one we used to see Buck fires the triple Sun still trying to find that three-point Rhythm here tonight 7 to 19 bases with six more made threes be a finger tip away from getting a steal and instead it turns into a phoenix foul be charged on Jones his first at 13 foul Pacers with two haer starting a little West Coast trip here before Christmas L Suns for the next five here at home Turner on the road of the basket well this is a team that comes in number six in the league in points in a paint at nearly 52 the Suns kind of turned the tables on them in the first half and the Pacers were the ones doing all the damage from Beyond The Ark that's been the continuing theme here in the third quarter Booker with Siakam running at him swings it across to Jones gets past Nembhard seven for Tyus coming up with a 19point outing he's got 15 plus points in three straight games Al buron finds the rolling Turner he too easy right now uh with Haliburton and Turner Turner is having a tremendous game averages not quite 15 points per game he's got 19 here tonight only two rebounds the ranch driving on Mathurin will take the pull up we just hope that the sun somehow start to get some stop and then take advantage of the game that they have been in place to do Haliburton with his step back three gets the shooter's touch he shoots it so high that if it does hit the rim he's going to give it a chance to go in Siakam try to cut off Durant nearly lost the handle swings it into the corner Nurkic with a corner three-point attempt Siakam a double double 15 points 13 rebounds over to Nembhard well it's that kind of nights a guy shooting 25% from Beyond The Arc and for nard hit his second three he's got a dozen and it is the biggest lead of the night for the Pacers in front by 11 8675 518 to go here in the third here in the third quarter this highlight brought to you by CarMax by with confidence from CarMax with upfront prices and CarMax certified quality cuz that's the way car buying should be learn more at carmax.com now Kevin Durant got off to a cold start one of five but he is seven of 10 C well you expected you expect him not to stay cold for the entire game but for me it's the the suns are all getting good looks uh it's just the turnover the turnovers and then obviously not communicating also uh defensively Bradley Beal was not happy with the last particular play you got to rotate to these guys they want to shoot the three first and foremost right now they're in a great Rhythm and sheer checking in during that timeout the Pacers and Rick Carle happy to have him back the little dish inside be fired to pass outside to O'neale skip past Far Side Tyus launches TOA may have gotten a piece of it it's Obi Toppin who led the bench scoring with 13 in that first half Nembhard on the drive whistle and a foul Nembhard's got a dozen five of nine from the field he came in 7 of 27 from Beyond The Arc he is two of two so far here tonight well Suns can't just get too far ahead of themselves in regards to thinking this urgent see here 16 minutes plus left in this game patience are going to give you an opportunity you just got to keep your head about you besides will return of the courts Saturday night against the Pistons for the next Valley night this time we're looking back at the last time Phoenix hosted the NBA All-Star Game back in 2009 when stat sha Earth represented the Suns with Shaq taking home co-mvp honors it's your tickets now at suns.com Durant on the drive will get the whistle and a foul is Toph it raising the hand his first personal help the signs if they can get one more foul to get themselves into a bonus situation Durant trying to get some separation from toen back door pass inside the he but it's another Phoenix turnover Haliburton finds simh har jammed up by O'neale foul on Roy and a technical foul on Roy the same ball don't lie yeah again the B is get very aggressive they have a lead now they're being very aggressive and trying to get to the rim dhart is always going to try to get there Sun's in danger right now of really digging a big hole they they they got to say to themselves look we can't get it all back here from this 4E 28 but you can get it back to the service of the range going into the fourth quarter so it's going to start with obviously taking care of the ball that pass that Kevin Durant tried that's a pass when you're up 10 like when you're down you just those are the passes you got to be careful with unless you're 100% sure you can get it through yeah it is suddenly turned into a 14-point deficit for Phoenix uh Sheppard little too aggressive with his defense second player out of Belmont missed nearly a month with an oblique injury something in the bonus M I like the substitution of done maybe he can shake something loose and get his hands on some balls and send it the other way Allen fires back across the floor Tyus with the look well the three ball just has not been there yet tonight toin trying to respond with a three Durant with a tap but into the hands of Haliburton Nembhard on the drive he gets tied up Allen nearly had the steal got to secure it before you go the other way Allen would have had it if he had been definitive to just go after the ball nard backing down he was trying to bait Jones into the foul but he wouldn't take it done of the pass nearly stol Away by Obi Toppin who came flying our way gliding there with the scores table kind of grim a little bit table don't hurt s Martinez game offs director always at the ready as Tyus trying to sneak up a jumper over Turner real quick but can't connect trying to stay attached to Haliburton pass inside still away by Durant that's probably the best overplay defense we've seen from the Sun all night K on the driveing kick swings it out to O'neale what a whistle and a foul cold on that pass by Durant both teams in the bonus here the remaining 309 this is a game where the bench has to save you right uh Durant P's bench played pretty well so they've been able to be very effective here yeah it's not been a a big disparity 14 to8 as Kevin Durant with his first free throw attempt of the night had just two free throws in that game Sunday against Portland he'll get one more after a timeout called here by the Pacers we'll keep it here with 309 to go 18 for Kevin Durant but you know it it sounds so simplistic age and you heard Chad with Amanda's interview there at halftime saying just got to take better care of the basketball but the problem is is the 13 turnovers have ballooned into 25 points and you had made this comment earlier with the deficit it creates a situation where you need to play almost turnover free basketball the entire fourth quarter yeah because look you've been very Reckless so you can't continue to stay Reckless like now you got to be careful and because look they have they have eight more shots than the Sun and those eight shots have turned into one more field goal overall all but 15 threes and that's the difference limiting turnovers and also cranking up their defense as it's now time for the Triple A live life confidently kind of Defense the last couple of possessions yeah much more active much more aggressive stand in front of their man and that's the kind of defense they're going to have to play right here and as I said Indiana will go through stretches where they start to struggle and let you in the game and right there the overplay defense all of that is what the sun's going to have to employee now they've dug this old for themselves and so they got to find a way to work their way out of it like again knocking down shots has not been a problem shooting 50% on the night problem is as I stated is that they're giving the Pacers more shots so right they're they're okay with missing more because they're getting more Kevin Durant with the pair 2 82% from the line on the season here is TJ McConnell back on the floor is Haliburton and Siakam the only starters you need help there you can't let him just back them back Siakam inside challenged by Morris but gets the follow yeah that's what I mean even if he misses it he's still got an advantage to get the rebound 17- 14 from Siakam done flashing past top and Kevin Durant going to work on him one-on-one on the drive inside had bad in inions but couldn't get the Finish Pacers in transition Sheppard pulls for three back tap controlled by well that looked to be almost obvious that McConnell as moris scrambling for the loose ball and this might get overruled as Rodney M comes out and it will be Phoenix ball and McConnell's not arguing so you know they're right Suns won their earlier challenge so they've got one here in the back pocket sounds been on the other end of calls and it's unfortunate but you got to find a way to battle your way through Kevin Durant on the drive gets tangled up top it with a steel McConnell up the floor to top it a block from D but a foul as well yeah the the foul comes on the push into Siakam let's go back to the last couple of plays with Durant so here is Ryan the push of Siakam well not a huge push he's trying to get to the defender but right there I mean just grabbing his arm on the play now it's not an aggressive foul but it's a enough where you compare it to the fouls that they have gotten you say okay that's a foul Siakam the two- time allar double double 18 points 14 rebounds three assists Durant on the catch and shoot won't get it top of him clears it's an important 145 here TJ McConnell on the drive and he will get himself to the free throw line yeah right now the the Pacers kind of have the Suns on their heels defensively yeah and again they're just a scrambled defense that's all they are that's what they doing and we're not fighting through it and being patient and then they'll turn it around they have house money they got a big lead they're not going to take take threes now they're attacking the wi Connell knocked it down the first as we get a message from our friends at Chaz Roberts AC heating and plumbing Chaz Roberts ACM Plumbing familyowned since 1942 con one to two his Suns desperate for a bucket they have gone 434 without a made field goal I think Kevin Durant can get a foul here y him very aggressive on him the ran head down to the drive lost to handle but his trickles back outside now as the rookie done five on the shot clock the raising up over Siakam McConnell on the drive gets inside left hand done forced him high and long on the shot grayon on an opening what a beautiful reverse McConnell able to sneak in the back door he's not going to play on the perimeter you guard that guy you just know you got to stay between he and the ball and it's he's in the paint that's all he's operating to get to ran outside waved up the screen lost the handle another Phoenix turnover and a foul on top of it now free throws coming here for Siakam with 39 seconds left well and Pacers are also starting to create a gap between the free throws for both teams they are 20 of 25 with 26 of 27 coming up the Suns meanwhile 16 of 17 man you just you just can't be minus 17 and turnover point and expect to have a sincere chance of winning it's just you have to virtually be shooting high 50s you know and well beyond High 50 you you've got the disparity in the turnovers but we pointed out they've already they've got 24 more points off the three ball and that's what I'm saying like you have to be shooting lights out to make up yeah for the minus and turnover points sons have not shot well in periods of this game they they got close numerous times they haven't been able to sustain it it's hard to do man gets a screen he will line up the three ball but that has been the story since the opening quarter Sun's just ice cold from Beyond The Arc thus far seven of 23 Sheffer with the screen McConnell on the drive kicks it out to Mack quick pass up the floor to Dunn you'll take the two however you can get him versus saving the clock for the final shot maen challenged by Dunn leaves that one short but a big third quarter for the Pacers they out score the Suns 3724 it's brought to you by Schwarz laser ey Center visit team ok.com the sun shooting better than the Pacers but it is the points off turnovers that has created a significant disparity here as the sun's Trail by 14 heading into the fourth quarter and as we headed the fourth quarter let's s it over to Amanda with an update on Booker yeah well in the third quarter Devin Booker went to the locker room I just got word that he has groin tightness and will not be returning to the game and I wondered if something wasn't up age we saw that last couple of rotations and he was not out on the floor 25 ran D yeah Ryan Dunn didn't play the first half and he was out there and again is just a snake bitten situation with the big three it's like they somehow cannot last a game now I mean it's like something happen and it's unfortunate you know look if de notice the at tightness the the smart thing is to go sit down yeah you don't want to make it work it's just you know it's just frustrating when you just can't get to see how well these three can play together uh because something seems to pop up well and that was certainly the the desire and the hope with Bradley being sidelined for two games and you know it certainly benefited that they had the the break in the schedule that they did as Monte fouling a three-point attempt he'll get another one here and in looking ahead you know you typically most coaches general managers will tell you you get a pretty good sense of a team's body of work and their identity after about a 2225 game Run and that's really not been the case for Phoenix because of the injuries and and Monte missing two of three and right now every free throw is extremely valuable as Turner with a mismatch inside to Grayson Allen Grayson though contines that big body forcing him outside three in the shot clock McConnell on the driveing to pull up see he's good and it's just it's amazing how uncanny he is with getting that shot off over big people with the shot clock at two with everybody knowing that he had to Allen getting back to the left hand Tangled Up by Siakam gets a shot up and will get himself thr line no they'll say they might as well you know keep it up they've been pretty good at it the Grayson to the strike his first free throws tonight just two points on the night for Grace Sun 17 of 20 Allen makes it 18 of 21 remind you give Buzz RX a shot and save up to 80% on your prescriptions find discounts at Buzz rx.com Suns well I mean look Suns hav't had that kind of win where down like this short-handed a little bit Devin's not going to play but all of a sudden gets a tremendous play off of guys that's not counted on to take a ton of shots let's see who can step up here plenty of time left well these two teams have for the most part been involved in tightly contested games throughout the season as Mack able to split the Defenders and slips inside they mixed it up well I mean they knocked the three down early and now all of a sudden they're just wasting no expensive getting to the rim in and out on that one for be yeah Pacers were five of 11 from Beyond The Arc in that third quarter they had a stretch there where they hit three straight he doesn't miss that stop yeah like I I'm serious like I you rarely see him miss that like you're letting them get to his spot why crowd him get off of them let's see if you can make a three because he wants you to get up on him will be whistled for the foul that isou third team foul and for Mathurin personal foul number three that helps see if the sun can keep pushing that didn't get to the bonus early in this quarter that will definitely be a help back door cut Allen had it block him behind by Sheppard kept it alive on the pass Nurkic has got it sto It Away by Mathurin turnover number 15 so you go from the back door cut what appear to be an easy two for Grayson the shot block the loose ball turnover as Monte on the drive can't get the Finish Tapped Out controlled by Allen Beal floats a pass Roy on the drive drops it inside to Nurkic blocked gathers on the follow and free throws coming here for Nurkic with the Pacers right now their offense is energizing what we're seeing on the defensive end of the floor well again the defense is not bad on the perimeter like they they scramble and they're always in passing Lane and so if you're not like being careful when you first release the ball they're going to pick it off because they overplay everything because they want the game fast and that's why you have the back doorm and all of that so you as a passor you got to be patient and and make sure that you don't throw it to an angle where they're going to jump the lane they've done it a numerous amount of times here in this game already Connell on the drive take that little 12-footer won't get that one Allen clears on a Miss up the floor out of Beal Bradley hits the checks hamers it home timeout Pacers 911 go a fourth Suns needing a rally Suns haven't had many uh stops and go right there they did quick bucket for Bradley good to see number three back on the floor yeah Brad's had a very good game uh again only taking seven shots and he six to seven you know nobody has to tell Bradley Beal to shoot it he has a green light especially now Devin out you know you's got to look at that Rim uh and and take take the aggressive lead here I mean he has been a problem for the PAC well if you are making plans this is the time to make sure you are in the house Sun for the back-to-back battle against yic 23rd and 25th Christmas night and then Luca that's Steph and John there's a goal right now son can get this thing to 10 with about 5 minutes left that's an opportunity Suns know all about playing close games down the stretch as Siakam with a tough turnaround Nurkic there on the rebound but it's got to start with getting stops and then taking care of the basketball Katy on the drive with a pullup gets the shooters touch nard Haliburton making their way back to the scores table here's mconnell he's got nine Off the Bench watch Turner popping back M cut off good defense that time by be but tough bucket 14 for Bennedict Mathurin double team comes but the pass stolen away maen on the drive challenged by O'neale they get the block suns in transition and Kevin Durant able to get into the defender and that's going to be toul number five so the Suns will be in the bonus remaining 754 here KD's head stretches uh where his timing on his passes just been really off and tonight I think he would agree I mean just extremely loose with the basketball and and they have picked him off relentlessly in this game yeah unfortunately that's uh eight turnovers for the team 16 that have led to 29 Points Indiana doesn't need much of a reason to run and anytime it's a live ball turnover that's exactly what they're looking to do missing free throws here that's not aggressive to get back in the game 21 of 26 Turner with a jab step he'll take that three point attempt comes up short with that one he's hit three on eight attempts now for the night Durant dribbling into double team now top it he'll go to that Baseline fade 26 for Kevin Durant I said I said 10 points at the about the 5 minute Mark all of a sudden that Rim gets kind of tight for the paces Mathurin tied up nowhere to go but finds Turner at the last second hand off to Nembhard looked like that could have easily been a travel but it is a turnover nonetheless O'neale's got it finds a slashing Grayson Allen who brings the boom 102 Phoenix run the fellas have got lots of juice left not only the dunp from Grayson but the speed to get past the defense Elevate with e have found themselves in a big hole here in this second half but they have put together a late rally here Grayson Allen bringing the crowd to their feet with the thunderous dunk got the timeout from the Pacers and they have pulled within 11 here each yeah now let's see how appetizing that Rim is a lot of times when you when you do make a run on a team and all of a sudden the flow that they had you know they've lost it a little bit because the Suns have made a run let's see if the Suns can get a quick stop here and do a little bit more D Haliburton gets it the hand off from Turner with a Ming good close out defense that time by O'neale Nurkic with the help gets tangled up with Maan five on the shot clock first five so it can be aggressive but the clock was running down Nurkic had a good view of it at the other end just to know that let's see if he can make a tough shot a reset of the shot clock third personal on Nurkic and thought about the three he'll hand it off the top at 13 first quar first half points has not scored here in the second half yeah that's it starts to get a little tight F there as well another whistle and a foul that's that's not a smart foul from to I mean you you're in the bonus you you have a lead you're off the ball it's weak side but it goes back to what was being allowed the entire first half in his mind he's thinking that that is the case you have you have a very sincere point there Professor I'm not going to argue that point and I apologize oh no apology necessary well I apologize cuz I I made a state you were able to correct rather quickly and I'm a little disturbed by that but okay something tells me you'll get over it third person along toping you said it E when you get to the bonus as early as they did you got to capitalize 22 of 28 here in the quarter cber finding Siakam what Baseline cut and finish for Pascal Siakam Nurkic was slow getting there though that ball was up in the air sailing Beal on the drive but couldn't get the Finish Haliburton hits the brakes fires the three no Nurkic with a rebound pass up the floor Durant just able to get a hand on it side step three coming from be in and out man R has had two go all the way in Haliburton trying to sneak Baseline Nurkic trailing him the entire way under five and a half to go Mathurin on a tough drive and reverse timeout Phoenix 524 to go in the fourth 111 97 Pacers in front trying to scratch their way back into it but the Pacers have had a response suns have kind of dominated this series of late coming in here they've won five of the last six meetings seven of the last nine including three straight here in Phoenix Pacers have not won here since 21 Fenix is going to have to strap on the hard hats here last 513 Kevin Durant on the drive drops it off to Nurkic with a thunderous slam double double for Nurkic 12 and 10 make them take jumpers that's it if they make jumpers then so be it congratulations you win but the layups right now cannot happen in this situation if you want to get back in the game Haliburton get a switch working on the rookie Ryan Dunn drops it off to nard who gets the Baseline jumper to go Haliburton pretty much dominating the game with his handle and controlling and he's only taken seven I was going to say he really has not looked to to be that flame throwing scorer what we know he could be at times touch pass Allen Corner three when the Suns have just not been able to buy a three-point shot tonight seven of 26 Nembhard has doubled his season scoring average 17 on the night he averages just over eight per game Siakam with a jab step he'll Splash another three Pacers starting a West Coast Road Trip as Kevin Durant able to answer with a triple of his own just his second three-point knockdown he's got 30 well Kevin Durant it tell you it's more of a a fractioned off 30 right got off to a slow start early I think that was a part of why they got a lead initially so it hasn't been his normal tight dominant 30 in regards to really controlling Tempo Siakam leaner won't go Allen there to gather finds a trailing Beal Tangles up Nembhard Grayson on the dribble hesitation kicks it out the Dunn sees the open shooter Corner three yes forant still plenty of time left it's about getting stopped plenty of time r 23 of his 33 have come here in the second half they've needed him no Devin Booker since Midway through that third quarter sideline with a growing tightness five on the shot clock Haliburton and that side step three won't get it high bounce over the backboard good good thing it did I thought Mathurin had the rebound over Grayson and to jump to the moon and knock that back out that's ridiculous what he just did that guy just looks for any opportunity to jump he literally jumped and touched the top of the back door wow I hope we got that onake he's got some Springs in those boots Nembhard able to get in Durant Allen cut off done right wing three no Brian's got to chase that though like you you in a situation now just don't stay there you got to go and and see if you can run get the rebound guns only have one team foul you can waste one nard on the drive Dunn Cuts him off Mathurin wanted the shot he'll pass it up hand to Siakam who gives it right back for in the shot clock Mathurin Tangled Up by Durant sun to the steel transition Grayson on the drive and finish 801 makes it a nine-point game you have a foul to give if you get in just remember they don't shoot free throw I like that Siakam cut off contested yeah Siakam ran away from the stren done up the floor passing across now to Allen final 90 seconds here in the fourth Grayson on the drive whips a pass pass Kevin Durant Corner three no Allen with a rebound Ryan on the drive inside blocked Away by Siakam and recovered by Siakam up the floor to Haliburton Sun's chasing now defensively as we close it on a minute to go Haliburton and long three Nur the back tap to Durant Kevin Durant up the floor on the drive inside with the left hand finish Haliburton calling for some help H maing there then the whistle and the foul top want you kidding me like just a little casual Off the Bench by the way wouldn't even like in the game he's like comes off the bench he could have jumped higher this guy can jump up and right at the top of the backboard that's amazing Mathurin Tangled Up by O'neale draws double team and then a foul by Dunn on Nembhard comes with 37 three on the game clock you know it's funny like you watch a game like this right and you say man why didn't the Suns have this effort defensively for the entire game right and the desperate what is a combination of two things it's one Indiana not being too aggressive now because the clock is their enemy so they're trying to run clock and then the suns are taking advantage of the fact that they're not going to take quick shots right early in the game if the Suns had been scrambling like that they would have been taking quick shots so that's why timeout Phoenix comes with 37.3 remaining in the fourth 118 109 Pacers in front and friendly menu in the NBA and apparently at halftime the uh concession lines were quite long it is already turned into a big big hit Suns working the inbound on a kick pass over to O'neale Siakam chasing Durant and he'll take a quick run to the rim for the easy two DJ mcot back on the floor here as he's quickly fouled by O'neale the facers will make stops and Sacramento and then a little further north against the Warriors disappointing though this dis disappointing LW Sons at home had a couple of days off uh it has to be disappointing to them uh what happened like some of the things that you know obviously haunted us last year haunted us again tonight and against a team that gives up parentally a ton of points and we made their defense look good and that that's the disappointing part free throws good Allen on it drive tangled up with McConnell challenged by Mathurin won't get the whistle and PA will just dribble this one across the mid Court stripe and there is no doubt about that need the Suns who had won two straight trying to get some traction and trying to make up for some of the lost time they've had they've had a healthy roster and unable to do it here tonight as they fall 120 to 111 Unfortunately they might have to play a couple of games without Devin Booker who had to sit out the second half so uh it's something that they really got to focus on and understand stand cannot turn the ball over especially now if Devin's not going to be in uniform for a few games 16 turnovers that resulted in 29
