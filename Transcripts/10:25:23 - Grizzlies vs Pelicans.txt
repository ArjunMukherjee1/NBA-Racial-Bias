 Grizzlies won the division in each of the last two seasons they've also won 50 plus games the last two years with one of the youngest squads in the NBA but they start the new season missing their best player for the first 25 Ja Morant in the off season though big Acquisitions veteran Acquisitions guys that you like a lot Marcus Smart as well as Derrick Rose well you know what if Dylan Brooks isn't going to be here you have to bring in someone that has a defensive presence so you go out and you get a guy like Marcus Smart two years removed from being this League's most defensive player of the year but also you need veteran leadership this is one of the most underrated aspects in today's NBA this is not simply about Ja bringing in these guys this MERS Grizzlies basketball team is a young basketball team Marcus Smart and Derrick Rose will bring some added leadership and experience to that locker room yeah ton of experience a defensive player of the year a former MVP the youngest in NBA history and Derrick Rose so huge Acquisitions well Z gets ready it's his fifth season and Zion Williamson and when we come back sits down with Antonio Pelicans basketball on Valley Sports brought to you by Smoothie King rule the day by energy we power life and by Toyota visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Let's Go Places welcome back once again to Memphis as we get ready for the opener well we know over his first four seasons he's a 26 points on 60% shooting we know how good he can be now can he stay healthy that's the big question is AD Antonio sat down with Zion Zion Williamson back again yes sir here with P forward Zion Williamson you remember last year before the Brooklyn game we sat down in Brooklyn and we chatted at that time and you hadn't been on the floor in a minute how are you feeling right now uh compared to last year m a lot calmer uh I'm excited but not overly excited I'm just ready to get out there and get to it you know when we sat down on media day you told me the individual accolades don't matter you said winning is what matters what does winning look like to you winning looks just like a winning program like a winning franchise cuz people remember winners they just they just naturally do cuz it when you win especially if you win the whole thing that's the final thing everybody see before they go into the off season and at the same time I think it kind of go hand in hand when you win the rest of the stuff gonna take care of itself you know we hear a lot of talk about James bgo his new offensive system uh the fluidity of the offense um just quickly talk about you guys relationship and how how has it been kind of implementing your skill set into that system it's like how Phil Jackson and you know whoever's with the bulls they kind of came up with offense around that special team with how to use everybody talents but do it within a flow of offense and I think that's just all it is uh you know coach JB he's always he's in everybody's ear just yeah like when you catch it here you can see this look like be when you catch it here look for these options Z CJ and the more we do it the more you just see it come together like okay within the Florida offense when be catcher here be he's in ISO it may not have been drawn up like that but he's there same for me same for CJ and you just get everybody moving there's an understanding I remember you saying before that it felt um more like a collaboration sir of you guys skill set and his his brain behind the skill set yes sir it's an awesome feeling man do me a favor what's up kill him yes sir kill him day one let's get it yes sir BL away from beel Street and as they say the joint is jumping it is packed tonight and with good reason this is a team that's gone to the playoffs each of the last two years and each season they were the youngest franchise in postseason play now the Pelicans get back there Zion with CJ herb Ingram Jonas for head coach Willie Green in his third year and Taylor Jenkins now five years as the head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies and they've got a real real talent in Desmond Bane marus smart now in his 10th year Ziaire Williams former first round pick in his third year with Jaren Jackson Jr and Xavier Tillman who's taking over now at the center spot for Adams who is gone for the year so we're just about ready to go we'll set it up with the officials as well but first let's join the third member of our team Jen hail Jen Joel this new James bgo offense is going to feature a lot of the Ingram who we saw close out last season those Final 14 games it was a lot of points Zion bgo wants to grow that concept really maximize VI's playmaking capabilities end his three-point shooting the is by and in he stayed late after shooting around today getting shots up from all over the court he cannot wait to play in this new system a lot more patience um Ball moving side to side before attacking a lot of driving kicks and um just me trying to be aggressive and find my space and figure out when I can be aggressive but just uh just me coming out and trying to be aggressive guys as we get ready to tip off let's not forgot forget this is where Ingram injured his toe last season cost him 29 games he might be ready to expunge a few demons tonight as well good point J and a lot of people forget as well that Randon average career highs in points and assist last year ad Keys going in it's all brought to you by your local Toyota dealers yes sir I got one key get to it that's what Zion told head coach Willie Green get to it you establish your identity right now right come out play hard value the basketball get to it set the tone for the season right now in game one it is controlled by the Grizz on the toss by crew chief Courtney Kirkland and welcome to a new season of pel's basketball it's really good to have you with us all Marcus Smart a longtime Boston Celtic defensive player of the year two years ago almost caught with a travel and inside of 10 on the shot clock ban right back to tman for an easy one blown assignment defensively you with with there being no Jamar you're going to see the usage rate for Desmond Bane really increase now Zion behind his back trying to get there blocked away but a foul and Zion is going to the free throw line boy what a Nifty move behind his back at the free throw did you say Nifty I like it I like it too not a bad way to start the new season not at all yeah he's going to get there there's no question about that and the thing that he's has to understand when you're playing against teams like this when you're playing his teams like Milwaukee every time you attack that Rim Jaren Jackson Jr is somewhere in the vicinity to come and block that shot a guy that is led the league in blocks in each of the last two seasons had the defensive player of the year in the NBA last year Zion gets the first point of the new season for the pells and the confidence doesn't he you have a world of confidence and you know what when you they a team takes care of you financially you know 200 plus million for B what that does is that gives you confidence yeah five for 207 the lob Jonas almost taken away and blocked away Jaren Jackson Jr and that was as a primary because he is very good as a secondary Defender Jaren Jackson leaving it for Ziaire Williams barely got there as Jonas secures it they're falling into the lap aren't they Ingram now the clear out good pass CJ and what a I mentioned that Zion could average 6 to8 assists a game but the thing that I like about that is they just ran Ingram to the strong side right Sometimes the best offense is simple offense Marcus smart Jaren Jackson hasn't left the paint and for a half hour Tillman gets the roll back and forth it goes minut it's Plus in he started 29 games for him last year and they were 1811 when he started so that says a lot about what Savor tman brings to the table Zion barges his way in but he's blocked again this time by Jaren Jackson tman came over but it looked like Jaren Jackson again your old teammate son and not close that time wondered to take the lid off the building with that CJ good look thought CJ had an opportunity to really turn the corner right there yeah go in but off the guy at hand the three was short Jaren Jackson Jr gave up the dribble looks like he's running on fumes right now I'm sure a lot of guys are running on fumes right now and nobody box out toan blocked by Ingram but fouled Xavier Tillman knows how to rebound there's no question about that timeing on the Flor free throw coming up and an early Advantage by one for the Grizz Trail by one Midway through the first quarter we're going to talk about how simple an offense can be sometimes let's take a look at my plays from Paris Spotlight brought to you by FanDuel CJ is simply going to run Ingram to the block I say it a lot of times Sometimes the best offense is the temple offense if we freeze it CJ is going to cut through and he's going to come out here in the corner now it's just on Zion giving him an outlet and Herb Jones screening in and what comes from this is a wide open shot because CJ cuts through comes out to the corner patience Swing Swing wide open shot that's textbook basketball but it's also a simple offensive play by running Ingram to the strong side block new backourt in the game theels as CJ sits down it's going to be Dyson Daniels along with Kira Lewis and it's always interesting early in the season what combinations work well together so the coach is finding out what guys click Trends Tendencies and a fit and now it's interesting because they're playing Zion at the five right now with Jonas being got the game which will give him a little more space to operate free throws coming up for Xavier Tillman in basketball family his mom he played at Michigan State his mom played at Michigan she left there as the all-time leading rebounder in Michigan Women's basketball history as he hits the first of two this is a team they were dominant at home they not only had the best home record in the NBA but they won by an average of 11 a game at home so it's always a test it's a good homecourt Advantage now it is it's a really Bells out of fouls three team fouls so far for the is one to give now trying to set up Zion as Kyo waited eight on the shot L for Ingram he's rising and he's fouled before the shot now they're out of fouls it will come in the side so Ziaire Williams he gets his first fouls for the Pelicans and one a piece for Ingram Zion herb and CJ so Zion takes his first break 6 minutes and 20 seconds into the contest Joel this is a good thing about having all four guys available is you can stagger them now you can run your offense through Ingram England Rony also into the game now from Memphis so is Luke Kennard good spin Dyson got there in the Finish sweet spin it's that time for Dyson to take that next step and I know pales fans are excited to see what that looks like yeah he was ahead of the curve defensively there's no question about that as Marcus Smart work it against Kira loses the handle and call on the foul on Kira that's a break for Marcus Smart and free throws coming up for smart recognizing that that spin move will be there also KN knowing that Luke Kennard is not the quickest and best defender right so you have to attack his feet Luke Kennard you better be glude to at the other end of the floor though because he's led the league in three-point percentage he so the last two years opening night at the Smoothie King Center it's the Pelicans and the Knicks everybody in attendance receiving a t-shirt courtesy of Smoothie King celebrate the new red statement Edition uni so come on down pelicans.com get your tickets right now opening night with the Knicks and the Knicks right now down by five at the half as they're opening at home against the Celtics little more than five to play in the first 12 tough place to put her in that position Tyra in transition gets back that almost takeen Away by Ingram will it be points off a turnover no coming up short Larry's got the board is Desmond Bane he had hit a three and the only other turnover for the PS Ingram bouncing around over Tillman tell you right right now they don't have a match up for Ingram you know Marcus Smart is probably the guy that can get under and into Ingram but you don't know the type of condition he is because he missed a lot of a lot of trending C the understanding that he can get to a spot and just raise up Kennard and smart now late in the shot clock a double clutch a Derrick rose coming into the game Larry can't handle the pass off his fingertips Derrick Rose Derrick rose get a standing ovation Circle back to the number he wore when he was a Memphis Tigers one year in college basketball so the youngest MVP in the league history checks in for the first time he's 22 years of age and what a year it was with the Chicago Bulls inside a four to play in The Opening 12 I keep telling people Derrick Rose still got something left in the tank just cuz you don't play doesn't mean you can't caught in the air but he found Roddy and they got a three if he couldn't get the layup he knew where he was going with it herb all the way to the hole and he's going to the free throw line and that's how that's how Willie wants him to play right great pass by Derrick Rose at this end hitting Ronnie in the corner but hey you can't you can't do anything about it once that ball goes through get it out push it up the floor it's a great pass by Derrick Rose on time on target once that ball goes through you got to force the Memphis Grizzlies to get back on defense right now the Grizz four of 11 so 11 of their 16 shots have been beyond the arc is Herb it's the first of two Pelicans are two of three on their triples now don't forget time to get allow this Saturday opening night at this movie and don't forget if you can't make it Saturday still tickets available for Monday and Monday got a feeling the Warriors will show up with guys on the two weeks apart they didn't play any guys Derrick Rose taken away by Karen no he got it back lowered the dribble three and a half to play in a very entertaining start rose tried to get there and he did didn't get the roll he still got some Jets doesn't he herb on the run all the way to the hole blocked away it was tman got back in time in transition laravia with Tillman and little bit strong and maybe out of control timeouts coming soon inside a three to play Ingram the hot hand and the follow away sweet stroke he can get to that spot Ingram a start to the game three of four and once he gets to that spot he's good he is good you can put your hand up but with the high shot release in the sze you don't really see that guy Kennard is not taking a shot Derrik Rose the three and the bells look to regain the lead after trailing by five bi's calling for the ball he's calling for the ball he got Rodney out of position all the way to the hole he thought he was fou it's going the other way got to get back in transition laravia it's Rose bottom of the glass and it belongs to the bells wasn't blocked that left hand scoop hit the the bottom of the standard so time out on the floor you could tell they needed it on Open night BBI talked to Jin Hill about being patient being patient let me get to my spot take what they giving me try to feel each other out in this season opener Pelicans missing three key members of the second line so how do their Replacements step up that is the subject of tonight's seat gek sideline report hi there everybody welcome back to Valley Sports Dyson Daniels one of the first Subs in he's ready to shoulder a larger load tonight Pelicans just picked up his third-year option by the way guys Dyson of course has always had a tremendous defensive prowess but this offseason he really worked on establishing an offensive identity he played for the Australian national team and no guys he didn't get a ton of minutes but a you and I have been talking about it just being around those older talked about that he talked about how he didn't get a whole lot of minutes but how how beneficial this summer was for him you know being around Joe Engles and Patty Mills and some of those Australian guys with a lot of experience walk out of the timeout they call the travel on CYO but that's what Woody green alluded to that more than anything else Dyson's ahead of the curve defensively the identity the Jen just referred to Willie Green said that's the key for him now at that end of the floor it's Jaren Jackson Jr not much of a postup guy taking the ball out of his hands almost take it away it'll be Kennard the wrong guy to leave in the corner and he's going to the line to shoot three Dyson got him so free throws coming up they were the worst free throw shooting team in the league last year got to go by yeah can't go in and that play started with Jaren zson JR doing the same thing that we gave Ingram credit for earlier accepting the double team once you take two with you now you get rid of that ball and allow your teammates the opportunity to play four on three so Luke Kennard we always talk about the premium on shooting and this guy was taking 12th overall he now at his seventh season and it was always a big deal because he was taking a pick before Donovan Mitchell but there's a premium on shooting and it was surprising in that three- team deal that he came over when it was Houston the clips and Memphis and Memphis gets a guy that only leads the league in three-point field goal percentage not bad two years at Duke he shot 49% 49.2% from Beyond The Arc last year as he gets all three free throws and it's a four-point lead once again the biggest so far early in this game for the brids it's taken away it was a kick it was missed and it was a kick by Kennard it may be the late call but it's the right call right but if they miss it you got to get back well you would think you have to get back when it's that obvious yeah minute 39 to play in the first 12 of the new season CJ back on the floor another kick Bernard's good obviously played soccer as a kid now Dyson so CJ and Zion they're looking for Zion on that side of the floor shot clock all the way down he's going to the baset it's a block it's a block couple the free throws Roddy Roddy had the right thought process he had the right thought process but never got square and we're at the perfect angle where you can see he he doesn't get completely square and you see Jaren Jackson Jr is a secondary Defender and still got it that would have been his fourth had the foul not been C he's already got three blocks and that's what he averaged last season nice to have a guy protect the rim at that rate and plus he's a spacer they can also shoot the three right first Miss free throw line for the PS they're now six of seven PS plus five consecutive in this building the division opponent so a lot of things you want to get out of the way tonight three-point game soyra getting some good run out there Dyson we need the minutes there's no question about that and maintain what the starters did did it's taken away on the entry and CJ out of bounds r that called touch fouls in the first six minutes and they didn't call anything there so it's interesting there's a smack that wasn't the I I didn't think anything there but it goes back to the Grizz with a fresh shot clock Derrick Rose and the wrong guy again can't leave him glad I said it so Dyson picks it up final minute Larry on the Run Jun is coming to impact that shot and a wide open three it's an interesting form isn't it kind of a push on a successful CJ fouled and going up as he was fouled and that's it that's a good play on his part cuz he's thinking two for one he's thinking two for one yeah hesitate get to that round stop the clock now you got about 4 seconds coming back CJ going to the stri for the first time tonight he's got five points early in his first eight minutes of the new season make it six and now word from FanDuel make every moment from rebounds to buzzer beaters mean more with FanDuel right now new customers can score $200 in bonus bets guarant guaranteed when you place your first $5 bet Bell's doing a real good job of getting to the free throw line it's going to be the 10th attempt early and they're nine of 10 at the strip to make it a one-point game so let's see if the two he wants mid-range he wants to get to the rack more than that but it worked and now the biggest lead of the game is six for Memphis Jordan Hawkins and foul they're calling on the handoff by Dyson another turnover that's seven turnovers already for the PS and and you know I don't put a whole lot in the preseason right but it's tough to make a proper assessment when guys aren't playing the regular minutes but I tell you that's the one thing that stood out to me in the four preseason games and Willie Green it stood out to him too Roddy too easy you can't turn your back on the basketball and that occurred eight-point game so they have outscored the bells now for the last couple of minutes 10 to2 Jonas too strong CJ after it he read it beautifully Matt Ryan Second Chance points welcome and a five-point deficit I'm still that M I'm still mad at Matt Ryan for the shot that he hit against first told him that last night I'm still mad at him that I hope you heard my call good hand you said it Tyson got it the deflection CJ on the move up against Kennard beautiful pass Dyson on the finish and he blows it again he'll get it the third time a charm hey I like the tenacity I like he stuck to it nice move and it's going to be a block on Ryan didn't get there square but I like that I like the thought process I like you know it's a cardinal sin in this league like y you don't leave the corner so he tried to do the right thing defensively but right here he definitely did the right thing offensively if there's one thing Matt Ryan can do it is shoot that basketball yeah he's got a beautiful stroke we saw that that not only in practice yesterday before we flew out but it shoot around this morning 16 in the shot clock so a lot of fouls in the first quarter that's the first team foul it's on Ryan on the block tracking Luke Kennard and on the deflection it'll still belong to the Grizz with 4.7 on the shot clock see with this unit right here you obviously have Jaren Jackson Jr who's a capable score but as far as making plays off the dribble is concerned that guy has to be Derrick Rose Ziaire Williams will bring it in trying to find Kennard they will and at the shot clock didn't get the rim so mini run now by the pel after they were down by eight Dyson on the floater got the I like that good first step yeah because he got a full head of steam he took itself off the three-point line got a full head of steam before that ball even came it gave him an opportunity to attack Derrick Rose heading downhill Joe yeah the young man was frustrated after the early misses not this time though an aggressive take by Dyson Daniels this new season just getting underway nonetheless back home in New Orleans your pelicans have already been out and about in the community trying to make a difference for some of our youngest residents this past Friday take a look awesome costumes Trey Murphy Dyson Daniels Jordan Hawkins Jose Alvarado Larry Nance Jr and CJ McCollum yep they all dressed up for Halloween guys and went to visit young patients at Asher Medical Center they visited some of their youngest fans I love the hugs oh and even a little accessorization good job guys excellent signing autographs taking pictures and dish out a few tricks or treats what a special moment for those young fans guys really meant a lot to them and got their minds off of their medical problems great on you guys and the kids the kids won't forget Jen no they will not Derrick Rose doesn't get the roll as Jonas pulls down the board so an opportunity now for the Pelicans after they were down by eight to take the lead CJ out there with Matt Ryan Jonas and Matt Ryan backto back he's two for and that's a set play understanding how Memphis is guarding these pick and roll scenarios covering boxes and elbows so you put Matt Ryan on that right wing to step into that three-point shot with the p Pelicans lacked last year Matt Ryan brings this season and that's three-point shooting Derrick Rose Roddy almost lost it now the shot clock is down on Rose as he's taking the runner a little bit flat CJ with Dyson Daniels can he get there out of Bounce and it'll belong to the bells I like the early offense though and they're looking for it set play you see Roddy is so far over Matt Ryan did a great job of sliding over out of David Roddy sideline but putting himself right in suiting position 17 on the shot clock of the inbound series CJ the focal point of the offense on the kick put three extra seconds on the shot clock the Pelicans up by two and that matches their largest lead so far triling by eight shooting 46% four of seven on their threes pick their spots well and Ryan's got two of the four yeah walked away can't get that one as Jonas after it it'll be Jaren Jackson they're taking a ton of threes Pelicans have eight they have 18 attempts Matt Ryan volume G they volume shootter shoot Joe 3833 that's what they do and he's here for a purpose that's right he understands the assignment he's by the way he's a two-way player he's got 50 games and it's going to be a foul on Mad R is second found on the floor before the shot no continuation and that's a really good read by Jordan Hawkins right you penetrate Baseline understand that once you penetrate Baseline that next guy over who was Matt Ryan should be pulling behind you to make himself a threat Desmond Bane will bring it in he's out there with rose Jaren Jackson Jr laravia and Ziaire Williams laravia now they've gone cold after they hit the early threes herbs back out there for the PS and this is where they really miss Ja Morant CJ got him out of position can't make him pay and it'll be out of bounds jar Jackson Jr all tangled up jonis did a good job when when this Memphis Grizzlies team struggles shooting the basketball you have a guy like Ja Morant to one push the pace and also get to that ramp and create easy opportunities a reason they led the league in points in the paint last year along with Steven Adams ability to offensive rebound right Second Chance points were big for them last year but now they're missing Steven Adams with the season as's Ingram back here Jonas another triple yes PS biggest lead of the game they're up by eight so now what that does is that makes Jaren Jackson Jr think twice about sitting in that lane because Jonas has made him pay for it twice marus smart the runner he'll get the roll had a time out out High screen and Willie upset over a non call but the Pelicans like what's developing and especially Beyond The Ark power play with the pells up by shakes and they just completed a 16 to nothing run before that timeout and the runner that ended it got in the middle of things Matt Ryan and Joe you know you and I have talked that length about the pel's ability to knock down shots like we can talk about all the offense in the world that we want to discuss the fact of the matter is that ball has to go in the hole Matt Ryan came in with one thought in mind let me go out and do what they brought me in here to do and that is to shoot that basketball and I like that pass play you mentioned Jordan Hawkins a shooter finding another shooter as we head over to Jen hail Jen that's what James Breo wants three right on his elbow and I love the patience that Ingram is playing with when he gets zire Williams in his HIIT pocket he's pump faking he's pump faking understanding that Ziaire Williams can't impact the shot so he is going to continue to jump that's excellent Patience by Ingram he's the first p and double figures with 10 on a real clean four of six from the field his second trip to the free throw line 525 to play in the half I like what you said though about taking his time right and zy Williams getting more minutes to start the new season they want to find out he was 10th over size biggest lead of the game for the pells Now They're Up by 10 on the deflection Marcus Smart gets there but Zion almost took it away he had four steals in 15 minutes of the last preseason game Tillman that's the guy you want shooting with everybody that's out there on the floor I'm glad Ingram didn't send it down low percentage Bane tried to front Zion over the top man low per Center's pass so another turnover Desmond Bane's going to be short and Ryan clears it out in a hurry now Zion you have to understand good that's an excellent pass because you have to understand who Marcus smart is and what he's going to try and do he wanted the charge no question he was bracing for contact the moment that Zion ran in that corner and put the ball on the floor excellent read by Z this is smart excellent read Roar the big fella for running the floor or cherry picking Sports out Bells out of the timeout up by a dozen they're largest lead so far they're seven of 13 from Beyond The Arc Zion just made a really intelligent play they've got 11 assists on 16 makes so the turnovers you clean that up 11 of 16 great I mean that's a great ratio and for me Joe I I I like the three-point shots that are being taken good play good hands by CJ y again they're not shooting a lot of contested three-point shots there you go run B run B to his hot spot and then play out of it CJ for three got it that's just simple basketball simple basketball BR and Ingram run to your spot I'mma slide away give you the space you need my man comes to double I'mma knock it down four minutes to play in the half how do you close out the half up by 15 now on a roll laravia wide open and Zion on the weak side so they've gone nice cold from Beyond The Arc Ingram another Triple A little bit strong but right on as tman picks it up so re Pelicans by 15 they're now eight of 15 on their threes five of 23 on the three ball for the Deep one Bane got it but he's the one guy that can do it so Desmond Bane picks up another triple his third he's five of nine overall he's got 13 points CJ with an answer coming up short and it'll be long to the PS again Joe I don't know how many times I'll say this throughout the course of the the Year this generation of the NBA is so incredibly skilled they're so skilled o benefit of a doubt on that one yeah the other way so Courtney Kirkland came in Zion knew it and it goes back in a 12-point lead Yas sits down Larry back into the game Larry joins roll that time Bane again looking for early offense against herb Who's Back In transition and a good job to get back in transition wide open it'll be to and quick touches in the half court and that's how they have to play without Ja Morant right ball movement player movement cuz they don't have that one guy like Ja Morant that just break down the defense and keep the defense on the SE eight to nothing run ban with a couple of triples and that outstanding play at the offensive end Ingram he got smart out of position and can he save it it'll be a jump ball that is who Marcus Smart is and that's who he's always been that's great defense cuz it looked like he was out of position but he got his hand in enough to just knock that ball away you watch he looks like he's out of position gets his hand in knocks it away and then be's down and he's right on top of it to create a jump ball situation got to find the teammate only 1.8 for the PS to shoot so it's got to be quick they've got to be alert to that fact as Ingram looks around for a teammate he's got Zion over to one side and he's treding to go to Zion but Tillman knew it so a turnover for the Pelicans and the hot hand is Bane herb all over him the lob it'll be Ziaire Williams his second bucket of the game on the setup so out of a sudden a 10 nothing a Rong inside a two to play Waiting for the pck Ingram on the run and they're going to call an offensive foul they're going to call a moving screen it'll be on Larry Nance and another turnover 13 to 5 going into this possession in points off mistakes and that's the 11th turnover already delay game on the Pelicans game New Orleans not the way he wanted to close after he had the mo so back to the Grizz I tell you the Memphis Grizzlies gave Desmond Bane 200 million for a reason 27 to be exact in a 5year deal that starts next season this is his fourth year he lost it it's kicked by Larry with 14 of the clock he's always been really good and we know that Joe last year career highs in points rebounds assists field goal percentage but confidence bring contracts bring confidence and when a team invests in you 200 plus million dollar you can see he feels like you know what this is my team just as much as it's Ja Morant right and CJ didn't quit herb gets hit foul how's it not a foul that's a foul and they only called it because it was going to be a jump ball and I hope Herb's okay cuz he came up the back of his last let's see how Herb's doing good yeah he wasn't going to call the foul that's a foul yeah you can't dive at a guy's legs right that's dangerous oh that is very dangerous but that's who Marcus Smart is though like he is going to be the first to the ground he won the hustle award was it last year yeah well and two years ago his defensive of the year what a finish of the half and a great second quarter for the Pelicans up by 10 at the break quarter F's now lead by 10 hi everybody everybody welcome back to B Sports time for our Smoothie King conversation with James BGA the author of this new offensive system coach it seemed like it took just a minute to get your feet underneath you what started clicking with your offense there I think our best offense is our defense this this team can really guard so getting stops getting out early getting stuff easy few too many turnovers 11's just going to be too too many for us so settle down trust each other keep getting to the paint share share the ball trust each other and they're starting to trust each other that's the beauty in this offense trust each other let the next man play three-point shooting it really improved as that first half went on you're now shooting 50% eight of 16 you're getting good looks though a lot of uncontested Threes how are you finding those shots well they're very aggressive in their pain they like to protect the pain our guys are just making the easy play right now try not to make it too complicated come off if you see two bodies kick it and don't hesitate Let it Fly shoot the open one I like the shots we got there in the second quarter thank you for the inside have a feeling the system's going to be fun to watch appreciate it thank you guys Joel you know what I like about what he just did he talked about the Simplicity of the offense right the Simplicity of the offense and it's not anything complicated that the PS are doing right now they're simply making the right play understanding who your opponent is Memphis wants to take away that blue they want to take away that paint so if they're going to take away that paint space the floor and prepare yourself to knock down shots now the pel's had 23 games last year where they made eight or fewer threes they at eight eight at the break right now they outshot him 52% to 33% in the second 12 minutes well they were six of 12 from Beyond The Arc in the second quarter Memphis was three of 14 thank you Tommy Cooper so the Pelicans got the stops and capitalize now what's it going to be to start the second half little with the starting five out there for the Pelicans and Jonas is close to a double double in 15 minutes don't forget about the big guys got eight and seven is had a couple of highlight PLS at the end of the half he had seven points with a couple of Dimes the P will start with the ball Ingram herb Jones CJ McCollum Zion Williamson and Jonas Valanciunas first play out of the break it's Zion up against Tillman nice passing herb on the run you look at for Zion on the deflection had a wide open three in the corner Jonas he already two of three now two4 from Beyond The Arc but a good look just the same Jaren Jackson Jr running a weave out front Bane out of control good de by her Jones playing and staying vertical without fouling Zion seeing a crease now Ingram herb the triple wide open looks Marcus Smart he's got a wide open Jaren Jackson is due Pelicans aren't complaining so they've gone ice cold to say the least Zion held by Jaren Jackson Jr Pelicans will bring it out of bounce with 18 on the shot clock on the side but I like the early look inside where he's trying to set up deep rim run automatic rim run and make him guard it Z played 15 minutes in the first half after missing so much time they want to get him in shape but they want to be cautious as well Ingram being tied up by Ziaire Williams no space on that side so he goes to the other side and they're caught on the offensive foul on Bron that left arm came out yeah that left arm and hit Ziaire Williams in the face you can see when he h right there yeah good call good call offensive foul is the 12th turnover for the Pelicans compared to six for Memphis so Memphis missing their lead guard Pelicans missing their best three point threat last season Trey Murphy points in the paint at the break identical at 20 a piece and I bring that up up because Steven Adams is missing so his Ja Morant almost given away now Jaren Jackson waiting for Bane with the left hand gets the finger roll he's very good he's very good around that rim with both hands and it pays to be ambidextrous when you play that close to the rim Zion setting up against Stillman and coming up short follows his own Zion now with nine points going along with a couple of boards PS back triples CJ one of the pick couldn't get it then Zion it's aonis a pinball he was vacating the premise he was trying to get into the and it wasn't was deflected now Marcus Smart that's tapped by Zion almost taken away but Bane leaves it in scramble mode and nice take and what a finish through contact J Jackson that was his left hand as well you got it Go yep count it again you know what I love about this offense thus far when Zion is down the floor they feed him when Ingram is down the floor they feeding it but you can see they don't have to take three four five dribbles one dribble they're at the front of the rim putting pressure on that defense Desmond Bane trying to get there he will couldn't get the Finish Jonas with another board so he's got 10 rebounds to go along with eight points average 14 and 10 a game last season Ingram looking at the mid-range got it PS by a dozen 5 minutes into the third we always talk about how key it is out of the locker room in the first five six minutes of the second half and you're not going anywhere Tillman under at the back door cut by Marcus Smart 10 in the shot clock smart and on the long rebound CJ ready Z's got Bane here comes the double beautiful basketball Ingram beautiful basketball com Miss shot but excellent read by Zion Bane on the Run try to get herb out of the way doesn't get the roll Ingram's got the ball so Cree to contact got the space he wanted but there's still ice core you make him pay and taken away by smart and he gives it away a break so the Pelicans too many turnovers they're minus six and points off mistakes right now again Marcus Smart is defending you you have to know what he's going to do right when you go pursue that ball you got to purs pursue that ball with two hands knowing that he is going to try and gamble that's a that's a big part of who he is rotation is Kira and Dyson we saw in the first half about 6 minutes into the first quarter CJ all the way to the hole doesn't get the roll good take but it was Jen Jackson Jr altering the shot got the board Bane denied but Jen Jackson Jr and he's overdue a brick that was a frozen rope Jaren Jackson Jr really struggling from outside 0 for five on his triple Zion all the way to the hole and a foul on Jaren Jackson Jr again I and and I that's you Jaren Jackson Jr is but Jonas has to get out he has to get to that corner Jaren Jackson junr takes one they're going to challenge this one I think they're going to challenge this one they're going to challenge this so a time of the floor a challenge by the Grizzlies and of course the new rules this year if you're successful on the challenge you keep it you get another and you don't lose your timeout with a 12-point game is it going to be a successful challenge for Taylor Jenkins they've taken a long time which leads you to believe it is going to be a success Courtney Kirkland crew chief coming to the microphone review the defensive block was legal there is no defensive file on the play it is a successful challenge Memphis will retain possession of the ball this is the first uh the second time out of the period This is the first challenge by Memphis and is a successful challenge therefore they will receive a second challenge of the game and Joe you and I were just talking about this when we went to break both of us thought that that would be a successful challenge by Taylor J because the armar in the chest is minimal in this yeah in today's NBA they don't call that right it's minimal contact so they're trying to figure out the clock now that's why cordate kin's coming back over Jaren Jackson Jr BL over the bench that would have been his fifth foul so he takes a break now that's worth the challenge alone right absolutely he's too valuable for them even though he's struggling from the outside two of eight overall 0 for five at his threes now Marcus Smart trying to set it up for Bane perb doing a good job on denial showman got there and got the roll he had the mismatch with Daniels Kira important minutes for them now can it maintain for the Pelicans there's the herb the triple got it I tell you that that frees everything else up and again Ingram doing his job taking two with him and then trusting his teammates to make the right read the right play herb Jones being shot ready huge bucket smart looking for a foul got the bucket but he was looking for a whistle the whole way Marcus Smart he's up to a dozen now herb though with that triple he's only taken four shots he's got nine points four boards three dimes same play so you can see what Memphis is doing now right inside out Kira a corner three didn't get the roll they're they're double teaming Ingram on any pick and roll situation smart he's been that effective tonight smart wanted in tman inside wrong guy wrong guy keep saying that Joel cuz every time you say that he misses thank you and I will Kennard now 0 for four in all four shots have been threes Ry on a clear out Ingram Waits good D smart almost took it away flat out and and and Will's telling them to flatten out and get Ingram space to Simply raise up and he will doesn't get it Larry back at it well timed by Larry Desmond Bane couldn't deny him inside four to play 13-point game The Ring of Derrick rose of Arabia back in for the Grizz now herb tried to stay on Bane mid range Joe that's one of the best parts of this job is watching players grow develop Kira coming up short Pelicans gang rebound here Ingram doesn't have numbers and he's going to the line Ingram is bleeding he's bleeding yeah two free throws coming up but you're right Kennard took a shot as Jaren Jackson Jr is about to come back by the way Jaren Jackson Jr they put up four it's three fouls because they they corrected that one right that would have gave him his fourth foul and Marcus Smart got a tech right blocked out but he did get a technical foul and he's just going to B for his teammate he's just going to back for his teammate Kennard to the locker room with the blood he knows and who takes the free throw you have to think it's going to be Ingram taking the free throw for the Pelicans on the T yeah they got to they got to clean his blood off the floor I'll be right there shoty got it Pelicans if you remember on opening night last year of the Pelicans big three combined for 74 and they did a number in Brooklyn they I mean it was they blew him out the second half but there's Marcus Smart yeah anytime you clap like that but it's it's also Marcus Smart being the leader right when you're in a new team new situation you come in with a reputation you know your teammates need to know that you got their back too and the reason they got him and Derrick Rose and nobody's going to admit this around here is because they want that kind of guy in the locker room with Ja Morant to a certain extent yeah but it's not just Ja Morant Xavier Willam Xavier Williams Ziaire Williams is Young Xavier Tillman is Young David Roddy's young um Jake laravia is Young well they been the youngest in the playoffs each of the last two seasons right so this is you know Kenny Lofton Jr young so this is a very very young basketball team and Derrick Rose said what he got here he wasn't coming here to babysit anybody he's coming here to push and challenge Ja Morant Ingram gets two more as the PS are now 11 to 14 at the free throw line compared to six of eight for the Grizz so we mentioned now if the Pelicans can win cuz only five of the first 15 on the road it would be a huge pickme up because 10 of the first 15 are at home and don't forget to join us all right Saturday it's the Knicks Monday Steph Curry Klay Thompson and probably Draymond Green with the way things are going for the Pelicans as Ingram gets the first of two but that's Monday night you join us at the Smoothie Kings Center bring the energy go to pelicans.com we'll see you there Monday night so Saturday the Knicks Monday the Warriors you know what I'm I'm going dress up on Monday you know who I'm coming as I'm coming as Joel Myers well put it this way I'm coming as Jo what did I say to you before we did anything tonight on camera I said P's way you wearing a tie on Monday or on Saturday I'm not superstitious they skip it and it's off R out of bounds pells up by 13 with the turnover Memphis has not done a good job of two things tonight obviously they haven't shot the three-point ball well and they have not valued that basketball those turnovers have killed Memphis tonight versus PS that is their ninth of the game Pelicans at 14 they had eight right away so they've slowed down somebody's out Kira coming over to the side pel already have a delay of game they wanted a te in a free throw so Kira comes over Zion back on the floor high up the glass and up the wrong leg get another opportunity up by 10 second quarter big for the PS when they outscored him 3219 and they get another stop going to be Derrick Rose real short Ingram's got it plenty of time to get a good look Ingram held on the spin and they had a foul to give and it's fou to give with 6.5 left in the third every time it looks and feels like the Pelicans are going to pull away this Memphis Grizzly team they they kind of dig in behind Desmond Bane and put that run together to keep themselves right within arms distance Pelicans have three more triples on I'll talk about few attempts pel's 24 attempts to 35 now Ingram into the quarter deep got it long two 2.2 to play no foul Bane looking for contact and he didn't even get it off in time Hells go to the break after three 36 minutes into the new season and lead by a dozen so a team that had the best home record in the NBA last last year the Memphis Grizzlies they're playing catch up opening night and the Pelicans lead by 12 11 19 for Ingram the lead the Pelicans 18 for CJ McCollum so you've got 48 right there and you know once you get into the season they find a rhythm you're looking at 60 to 70 at night minimum and for me it's not even the the numbers it's the impact right it's the gravity that these guys bring with them and and I I love the way that the pace and the patience that CJ and and Ingram are playing with tonight Hawkins out there for the bells now as they come on his Zone Jaren Jackson tried to get to the couple laravia with a good catch in traffic knows the clock is down and got it he looked back at the other end he knew only 5 six on the shot clock 10-point game for a first round pick 19th overall aravia now CJ on the run but is going to take a little Fall Away instead set up the shot clock upin zire Williams couldn't get him out of position Jordan Hawkins into the clock got the triple welcome Jordan Hawkins First career bucket first career shot one of it was wet threes it was wack over minut Derrick Rose right back at it makes it a 10o game once again you can see right now they're going inside the Jonas we talked about with this second unit is an opportunity to allow Jonas to use his size he's got it against Jaren Jackson did he get it off he walked and and you know this is a guy who knows they play together right he knows Jonas he is on Jonas's he is on his strong Jonas's High shoulder and not allowing him the opportunity to get to the middle for that little jump hook he likes 18 turnovers out scor 234 before this possession off mistakes Derrick Rose all the way to the hole it was tapped around in top tone Roddy he timed it down to eight critical time for the PS especially with Ingram getting his final WS Matt Ryan and jonis going to the free throw line it's a good play by Matt Ryan he couldn't believe he was that open down the middle and you know that's a play for him to come off and shoot that three-point shot but when he turned the corner like we talked about with CJ earlier you could see he saw the opportunity to attack that Rim good play good pass saa's going to the free throw line first time tonight he's already got 10 boards eight points and six shots that looked good on the first shot better than 80% now our Louisiana Lottery Power ball update we're going as soon as I get off the plate you're going what we're getting tickets I'm getting them theight first oh I like how I like how you included Jaren Jackson and a reach and he's going to the free throw line ha they give the foul to Hawkins has a little token pressure by the Pelicans they were going back into a Zone and it's you know I'm stating the obvious here but you can't allow a guy especially a big against a Zone to Simply turn the corner and get to the rim that easy all the way so we talk about strokes and Hawkins comes into the league and that young man has a beautiful stroke there is no question about that Jordan Hawkins but you look at the release and it works it's consistency and form and it works for Jaren Jackson Jr he's on top of the pells now Ingram's got 19 Jaren Jackson tried to get to a strong side blocked Away by Jonas and couple of free throws on the foul by Matt Ryan they did a good job when Jaren Jackson caught that ball and he was going to isolate a covering boxes and elbows you can see Ryan and Hawkins right there excellent pursuit of the basketball by Jaren Jackson Jr he's got six points with four boards on a two of nine shooting night 0 for five from Beyond The Arc and he likes to take the triples he he's a big spacer Jaren Jackson Jr 5 years ago fourth overall after year at Michigan State comes through at the strike for he four four pells by nine nine and a half left CJ off the highest screen Hawkins quick catch and shoot tough Jack Derrick Rose you got Hawkins off his feet Roddy or they whipping it and a walk he didn't put it down he talked about the fact of him being over from the three-point line and that's where that hesitation comes from that is their 10th turnover of the game and a delay of game now so the pells have a delay of game and so do the grids the Pelicans make them pay they're down right now by 11 and points off mistake to get to the cup all the way there doesn't get the roll stays with it and goes to the line back to 11 I like what you said about it is Trey Jose Naji because they're emotional same thing we said about Marcus Smart with the fact that the energy that you bring is contagious you know hearing Jose in practice hearing Trey Murphy in practice hearing six of nine from Beyond The Arc he's up to 24 timeout Memphis and CJ has just allowed the game to breathe and taken exactly what the Memphis Grizzlies has have given him he hasn't forced the thing tonight Pace patience bucket Advantage here at the FedEx forum over the Memphis Grizzlies one of the things that we discussed sh to for it if you look at these attempts right now the Pelicans are 14 of 28 for the three-point line and a lot of these shots are really good shots you move the ball but it's guys that are understanding where these shots are coming from they are from the wings and they're also from the corners CJ McCollum has been fantastic tonight at allowing this game to breathe and taking what the offense is given him yeah he rusher thing has he he's taking his time played it his Tempo his Pace out of the timeout Jonas picks up the Miss three and this is nice cuz you're going on this run right now without Ingram and without Zion Williamson a to have to play pour it in and Jonas off the window old school 12 and 11 now for Jonas 16-point lead biggest of the game for the Pelicans staying in front of Jaren Jackson last touch looked like CJ popped it away I I love this because when he has position we used to say this last year he's not going to get it often but when he has position he has to get that ball chicken RNG came out he hit yeah he yeah he hit him with a nice little chicken right there a body blow in boxing work the body hands will come down you can kill them that way 812 to play in regulation Pelicans have lost five straight in this building okay moisture cleaned up they're ready Marcus Smart he's got it to Tillman and blocked Away by her herb made sure of it not on herb herb with Matt Ryan Ryan's got three triples herb with Yus bad angle T a bad angle Desmond Bane will to be more points off a turnover 19th turnover of the game for the PS and it's a good foul it's on Jordan Hawkins y they they switched and Jaren Jackson Jr was rolling him to the rim got you off the ball right bringing it on the side with four10 in the shot clock so Dyson Daniels in for Jordan Bane and Marcus smart catch and shoot got a triple again any times it feels like the pills are going to pull away and extend that lead as Taylor Jenkins basketball teams tend to do they go on that run it'll be CJ oh herb unaccounted for back to 15 how about herb close to a double double now with 13 points and eight boards smart denied and throws it away good job Jonas met him up top nowhere to go you said it Joel no one counts for you you attack that offensive glass it's a good balance for The Pelicans Sensational balance and a resourceful group from the bench and this you brought it out this without Ingram on the floor Zion just checked back in but this is without Ingram on the floor with Zion CJ and CJ has been huge tonight Zion he got the step on him but it's tapped Away by Bane right on top of the basketball it'll be Marcus Smart three ball coming up short and the box out was there nobody secured it Bane and a late call but he's going to the free throw line Second Chance opportunity at the strike so the PS Now out of Desmond bang with back to back good plays on both sides of the ball you see him get his hands in there and strip it on one hand and at the other end attack that rim and create contact with CJ McCollum Bane leads with 23 for the Grizz he's n of 18 for the field four of nine from Beyond The Arc with five times and make a 24 for Desmond Bane averaged 21 a game last year the need for him to score more 6 and A2 left Dyson on the spin and the walk another turnover you want to put him back into the game that's the way to do it right to be up 13 and for your assist and your turnovers to almost be identical pretty wild so you have to be playing and shooting in a high percentage which they are Pelicans 14 of 28 of the triples 49% overall Marcus Smart trying to play fully ball good job Kira coming up it's Ingram Zion there and batted away now time of the shot clock Ingram ask him for the clear out Zion goodbye automatic nice seal to say the least 10186 in a nice entry only he could get it it's Roddy he'll share with Tillman it's a great contest by her Jones now after was tapped away Zion's comy he add the 15-point lead Ingram mid-range flat on that one stays at 15 five and a half to play Williams got there yeah big First Step long strides so the PS will take a time out set something up in a 13-point lead too much time left but on top still pelic leading score so far tonight also the one who has shouldered the biggest minutes load guys he says he is in the best shape of his life this season pretty good considering he just turned 32 years old it's all due to his amazing and meticulous conditioning in season 11 you know for the first time ever he didn't have a postseason last year and although that hurt the Pelicans hurt the city the Silver Lining was it gave CJ so much time to truly get healthy and we are seeing it pay dividends now eight of 14 from the floor tonight six of nine from Deep guys the leader of this Pelican Squad making his presence known this evening now listen Jen I understand that CJ McCollum's not going to shoot the ball like this all year long but you have to understand at the last year he was playing injured for a guy to play injured and then come back and half offseason surgery and then come back and shoot the ball like this you give him a lot of credit for playing through what he played through last season and Willie had a talk with him you remember Willie mentioned to us that once you get older you need attention to detail the little things to prepare for another season and he took it to heart I walked into the gym in early August and CJ was in there getting up threes he had a couple of guys firing basketballs at him all over the ark but the thing about CJ though is meticulous is a word that that's who he's been since he came out of Lehigh attention to detail right understanding his diet understanding conditioning all all of the little things that make him the player that we referenced earlier Pelicans by 14 inside of five to play Bane wi Tillman underneath and last Touch by Kira he's going to try to play a little bully ball inside got caught in the air so KY out there with Dyson Daniels eight on the shot clock herb Ingram and Zion the five on the floor for the Pelicans crunch time Jaren Jackson Jr as Bane he got him out of position and couple of free throws so her bit and now Bane with the strike Bane leads him with 24 Pelicans have great balance as I mentioned though all five starters in double figures for the PS tonight led by CJ with 24 Ingram's got 19 you got Matt Ryan with nine Off the Bench you know there's a lot lot of talk last night about Devin Booker and and how good Devon Booker is and how he's going to be in the MVP conversation and it's warranted right well when we win you win that's the motto this year you can get your tickets for the inseason tournament matchups it's the Mavericks on November 14th the nuggets on November 17th and an opportunity fans in attendance eligible to win a million in total prizes pelicans.com IST the inseason tournament pelicans.com for all the details now Zion collaps the defense Jaren Jackson's there a mid-range I love it I love it you and I have talked about that right if they are going to Sag off you and give you that shot Elevate and live with the result your touch is too nice not to take that on a consistent basis Jaren Jackson lost the handle good D on the run the hot hand CJ Ed Ingram Ed Ingram's got a little 15-footer after it how about a put back Zion's there Jonas tied him up team rebounding matching the largest lead of the game at the right time with four to play Zion up to 18 and seven now Bane good pass for Tillman to go back to what I was saying about Deon Booker the point I was getting to was about Desmond Bane Memphis got a nice one on their hands here strong play cuz you got he's not only got a great three-point stroke gosh I love that shot Joe the in between game I love that shot and the more confidence that grows in that shot time pells are taking the time out in good shape but a lot of time remains r on the floor is out of bounds and the ball is awarded to Memphis and New Orleans is challenging the r you welcome back once again a 16-point game they're looking to the Baseline play to see who was it out of bounds on by the way San Antonio the end of the first quarter has 43 points on Dallas at Lucas playing so who touches it last it off Jaren Jackson J hard to tell it's really hard to tell it's not I mean from this angle it's not it's not really inconclusive yeah yeah it's not there like it's not really it's inconclusive there's nothing that says you know what this is definitely the New Orleans Pelicans basketball for review the roll floor stands ball is going to be rewarded awarded to Memphis on the Baseline 11 on the shot clock it is an unsuccessful Challenge and New Orleans is still CH charging timeout 0 for one everything else has worked tonight though pretty amazing though uh the three-point shots because they weren't Force they were in the flow of the offense and they were as you said clean good looks where Memphis took a lot of Threes they've taken 40 for the game and they were playing catchup but a lot of them they were early in the clock it'll come in that's their best three-point threat right now Desmond Bane trying to get my his eye on tman and at the shot clock and a step through bail him out of a bad possession so CJ's out there with Ingram Jonas Zion and her starting five at the floor for the duration and one was like three quarter Court we used to talk about this last season that lob is is there that lob is there you just have to consciously look for it 245 to play it's 24 23 and 19 for the big three quick 66 at one of two as Jonas out of bounds off tman Jonas done a good job with another double double 12 points 12 boards be a star in your role whatever your role is be a star within that role that's how your team become successful collectively and the guys off the bench give them credit cuz they didn't try to do too much they didn't force it Collective the effort 240 in counting beat the eight and he will 20 turnovers compared to 133 same play Old School basketball going to his weak side high off the window and almost got the finger roll on the trail going to be pain and he got the quarter three Desmond Bane 29 on opening night maximize the shot clock Zion late on the pick CJ a 30-footer is going to be real short chase out and foul on herb yep loose ball foul free throws man Marcus Smart hit the deck and he's rewarded herb can't believe it it's a 50/50 oh man youel AB so Marcus Smart back at the stripe he's got 16 on 11 shots coming up short Nicks Saturday and don't forget start at home okay so come on now see the guys on Saturday night at 6 and Monday night the Warriors are in town as smart gets one of two inside a two to play Here Comes the pressure and get it across please it'll be Zion final minute 45 of a very strong last three quarters for the Pelicans they were down by only three at the end of the first quarter CJ it's been his night it's going to be short he knew that as soon as he let it go he was after it Bane and that got a block herb got a piece of that yes he did he took the blow and still got a piece of it man that's strong should theels working and I'm talking about the clock got to go me it yep her out on the wing Bane tapped it herb after it and going to give it herb just should have flailed he would have gotten a foul call out of it 63 seconds left sandal barbecue is going to taste really good tonight to be honest with you Joe since a barbecue tastes good anyway all the time but after a dub you know what I mean it may may taste a little bit better you had different guys throughout this night step up at different times right there was a time where Ingram was going there was a time where CJ was going Zion had a great fourth quarter Jonas with a double double so it's often you could say this has been a total team effort and everybody who's played tonight has done a really good job at contributing here comes the pressure Dion get it across the line with her the lob as didn't need it Tyson can't come up with it 45 seconds left it'll be Ry for three that should do it never a dull minute never a dull minute that could have made it a two-possession game by the way smart play by Dyson bring it back out clock is your friend Bane's got it Hells get the win against the division opponent on the road to start the new season very strong and it it really came in the second and third quarter that's right when they dictated the tempo don't have to even take it across the line that'll do it Pelicans into a five-game losing streak in Memphis and beat the Grizz on their home floor the team with the best home record in the NBA last year they were 35-6 here and they outscore their opponents by an average of 11 a game listen Joe the West has never been deeper it's a promising start it's never been deeper so the games that you are supposed to win you have to take care of and this Memphis Grizzlies team obviously without Ja Morant you know no stepen Adams for the season no Clarke and obviously the Pelicans are without certain guys too no Trey no Jose no Nai come in here and take care of business and a new season thank you Tommy Cooper because with Pelicans trailed at the end of the first quarter last season they had a record of 3 and 14 new season new mentality completely as we head over now to Jen Hill Jen thanks Joel CJ getting lots of accolades from all sorts of folks he needs a a breath he was playing up into the last second CJ this game got broken open in that second and third quarters when this new James borle offense really started to seem to click what did you like best about it we got stops uh we got a little sloppy down the stretch we got to do a better job of executing I got to make a wide open three but outside of that I thought we defended really well uh shared the ball and had a lot of turnovers so this is a game we should have won by about 15 but it's a it's a good learning experience for us and hopefully we get better for the game on Saturday always looking for learning points I love it uh it was really fun to watch Point VI bi's playmaking when he found Zion for those dunks it got the crowd going even though it was enemy territory what is that connection like for you to watch on the floor he's been doing it in practice all preseason he's he's a really good passer he's so tall he can see over the defense and has great touch and their chemistry is contining to develop as we play more together your team win you got contributions from so many different guys talk a little bit about your bench because it's short-handed you're missing three of your biggest guys but the job that Kira Lewis and Dyson Daniels did tonight yeah Kira's been great all preseason he's probably had the best preseason on everybody on our team so I knew he'd be ready Dyson's improved works hard defends well uh Matt Ryan uh he just got on the team a few days ago you know he can shoot the ball extremely well Larry gave us great minutes um we I think we're we're we're learning we're getting better each night and trying to execute coach's game plan and get used to the spacing and stuff so there's a lot of things we can tighten up but I like what we were able to do tonight that guy Matt Ryan might have something Beyond The Arc I don't know for you CJ the first time this offseason that you didn't have postseason play but you used it to get in what you said was the best shape of your life you led the team in scoring and in minutes played tonight how are you feeling after two surgeries this offseason I feel good I feel good I got to continue to tighten up some some uh paint finishing tighten up some playmaking and just running the team better but overall I'm me I'm in a really good space I'm in a really good place and I'm looking forward to uh a full season healthy we're looking forward to watching CJ enjoy the win starting the season on the right foot thanks for your time I appreciate it thank you guys all right Jen FanDuel player of the game that's CJ McCollum he was super efficient tonight that's 24 points on 16 shots and six of 11 and the missed his last two or three shots you know in the last two minutes of a game hey he played more minutes as Jen mentioned 37 and it's opening night and the energy you expend you know you're you're all amped up we talked about it at the top of the telecast yeah yeah opening night never gets old it never gets old like I don't care how long you've been playing in this league you still get the butterflies in your stomach to come out and perform at a high level so a huge one on the road now don't forget go to pelicans.com and we'll see you at the Smoothie King Center start Saturday night for the Knicks then Monday night back to a start against the Golden State Warriors for ad Antonio Jan Hil I'm Joel Myers Pelicans live coming up next don't go
