 let's get to it TI of the air sha Corbin suash meta are three officials Kane Fitz Jer is in the replay Center Dennis Schroder coming over from Brooklyn making his eight start Curry lines up a three got the Fly By by embiid and that's how we start tonight's action just like that he saw out of the corner of his right eye embiid trying to trail out to contest that shot by curry good patience there by Steph Maxey Eastern Conference player of the week it's the second time he's won that award and he really is taken over as the alpha certainly embiid when he's right when he's healthy is the Sixers best player but the guy you can rely on is Maxey there goes green he drives it and lays it in that's what shooter has to bring to this team his dribble penetration being able to create that opportunity for Draymond Green another car that close out to start this ball game on Curry Embiid had played four in a row he did not play last night Embiid and UB sat last night UB is not available tonight either he's in Street close green up top Jackson Davis can't finish it and beid there to disrupt it now Tyrese Maxey at the controls nice pass and blocked from behind Draymond Green George George had a big game last night and he did foul out but scored 30 as Jackson Davis lost it look like Lowry may have got a piece to knock it out of his hands and that sets up Martin for three long rebound out to Wiggins Warriors without Brandon paj jimsky and Gary Peyton the second tonight paj jimsky out with an AB not shot the ball well here in this cold stretch someone not shooting well only shooting 1% since the trade V Schroder knocks down his first tray here of the evening look at his eight game there's a giveaway by the Sixers ends up in the hands of curry curry no look Jackson Davis denied by embiid imp with a strong block this is going to be a tough load here for Trayce Jackson Warriors are very small they don't have a player on their active roster tonight over 69 turnover Golden State Maxey with Wiggins on him and sets it up for George George drives it George little step through able to lay it in foul out in the game but had 30 in last night's loss that was without embiid here's shrer again and sher's got another one and this is so important for the success going forward for in Brooklyn averaging about 18 points but he was shooting close to 40% from three he hasn't found that that range since the trade but it's a good sign tonight two of two he went from 18 a game in Brooklyn to nine a game in his first seven games as a Golden State Warrior just hit a milestone his 1,000th career three-pointer Dennis Schroder with his eighth organization now got Caleb Martin on him five to shoot Wiggins will let it fly and embiid clears Sixers at 13 18 and George bangs his way in offensive foul Schroder stood in there and took the contact and that's another thing that game wiin cuts and scores Jackson Davis set him up nice bounce pass you talked about already the the turnovers by the Sixers it's kind of a microcosm of that stretch that 3 minute stretch to lose the ball game last night record is and right now they're 16 and 16 that's average that's 500 basketball he told me he takes as much accountability as to their struggles as anybody else told me he needs to raise his own level the team needs the guys to get back to playing with confidence in the joy they had Steph said no team gets off to a 12 and three start accidentally he feels and there's so much fluctuation because other than OKC and maybe Memphis everyone else is trying to find their way as well and everyone else is going through the injury bug and you mentioned this at the top the different starting lineups Steve cerr and the Warriors have used this system I I think trying to find that balance right you know I think you've got Anderson who's out of the the lineup along with Kevon Looney short up the rotation trying to find pieces to get comfortable offensively Jackson from Wiggs so Jackson Davis on the receiving in this time well he got his shot blocked earlier on a play trying to go up against NB this time finish the play Jackson Davis he's got a handful dealing with a bead settles for the jumper and Curry with the ball gives it up Schroder allows Curry to play off the ball quite a bit little razzled bazzle and that was just too much from Green thinking Jackson Davis was there for him on the L got to remember embiid is a presence but the Sixers in the pain Maxey missed it I like the pace here Golden State two of the four oldest teams in the NBA average age Warriors certainly want to get out and run where they can Lowry guarding Jackson Davis and forces the turnover Maxey puts on the Jets Maxey with a left hand no missed opportunity Maxey he slow to get down the floor as well Draymond Green drives and lays it in and the Sixers looking a step or two slow here on the second of a back to back they're still in that haze from those last three minutes versus the Kings you go back to last night and then add tonight they've gone the last eight now almost 9 Minutes they've had nine turnovers in Toronto Raptor looking at that bling bling on his wrist earlier oh he's got a nice watch from that championship in Toronto George to Embiid extra pass Reggie Jackson rattles hit it out curious to see the number of three-pointers we get in this game here tonight good that Reggie's on the broadcast as always 57 three-point attempts by the Celtics in the first game of our double header Minnesota Boston combined for 96 threes in game one what a impressive win by Boston they have not played their best over the last 10 days or so Philadelphia beat and in fact what missed the first nine games of this season so it's had a lingering effect on him that was January 30th coming up on the anniversary of that they were rolling at that time beid was putting together an MVP campaign and the Sixers were playing well comfortably inside the top four they had a first round exit against the Knicks last year and indeed never really the same as Curry met at the rim s- eight Warriors lead it you see since the fourth quarter last night against Sacramento and that collapse they've been out scored 32 to 8 nine turnovers only two made baskets make it three now as in speed stays with it and gets a put back George will pick up the foul 88 at home 8 and 8 on the road as Jared mentioned Steph Curry saying they're just average just playing mid right now they're hoping to find some offensive power power that's one guy who's been bringing it Off the Bench Jonathan Kuminga nice setup there by Draymond Green picking up his first assist and it's the back cut there constant move movement on that back side for the Warriors oh look at this oh a shot green hits the deck and another offensive fou Draymond green got up in said five turnovers three made field goals for Philadelphia Kuminga races to the basket unimpeded an 11-point Golden State lead the Warriors have nine made baskets nine assists here watch how Draymond Green is playing on the weak side and still guarding Joel Embiid Wiggins pulls down the rebound lot of traffic in there for George to deal with Buddy Hield in the corner offensive rebound Curry missed the layup Reggie Jackson pushes and now Yabusele lays it in big fella running the floor been a nice story come back to the NBA after the last 3 years in Spain and a terrific run in the Olympics for France there's sha Yabusele here is Kuminga for three see this is when Kuminga can make a next step if he can knock down those three on a consistent basis that's been the question mark here 32% three-point shooter gab inside he's a handful in there yeah but nice cut right he recognized that it was a quick double on Embiid Wiggins fouled from behind a race to the basket and Mar with the five years really helped shape him and get him ready for this rooll guys who has led to him being an incredibly valuable really materialized when he got those chances but to his credit he goes overseas and most recently in Spain with the best team over there in Real Madrid and found his shot found some strength got himself in very good condition and all the playing time give him a lot of credit he's fought his way back to the NBA only played 74 games in those two years in a Celtics uniform but again the maturity level going overseas he just got to grow up a little bit and that's exactly what he did and now it seems like he's found a home Jackson Davis look like he had a a shot there he gives it up now around the horn it goes Warriors really moving it well Schroder still adapting to this Warriors offense finds Jackson Davis Ricky Council in transition Council strong and he is fouled tough to slow him down with a head of steam then a rough start for Philadelphia just 14 points on the board as Moses Moody checks in and Wiggins will sit Jeff Dowtin on his way as well George picked up the two fouls Nick nurse will take advantage of the final two minutes of this first quarter one out of two for counil Arkansas Razer back Moses Moody a former Arkansas Razer back on the floor SC and guarding one another Zone here for Philadelphia buddy Hield what is going on with Buddy Hield as a major question he started the year on fire Reggie it just has not been the same shooter during the stretch indeed with a flurry of moves but can't finish it Sixers have just five made baskets in this first quarter with a minute and a half to go five turnovers five made field goals they're five for 18 Jackson Davis finds Moody Here Comes kuminga now Ball's moving well shreer for three got another one his third in this first quarter for shrer all of his shots have been three-pointers he's hit all three again coming in in his seven games with the Warriors only shooting 21% from downtown Council driving on Hield Council gives it up yabas oh he just knocks Kuminga off the block big body look he was the second leading scorer on that France team right behind L Yabusele played a lot of five on the French team as well as Moody comes in hits a three-pointer Warriors six of 10 in this first quarter we highlighted at the top they're only shooting 34% on the season from three embiid passes up a three Trayce Jackson Davis knocks it out of his hands embiid gives it up Council long three Kuminga he's got Hield up ahead Kuminga runs into Dowtin coming to the end of the first quarter it has been all golden state Sixers looking sluggish tonight and a three is down buddy Hield finally he's saying he throws his arms up guy that's been struggling from three he was shooting 50% the start the year and then have just taken a nose dive here media guy does it live Hield has been a great shoter the former sixer throughout his career as embiid gets to the basket and the Warriors chance at the last shot shrer and that one beyond the AR their eighth made three they have more made threes than the Sixers have made field goals in this game how about the ball Movement by Golden State down guarded by Curry finds jabu in the corner and a three-pointer is good that's a part of his game that has vastly improved from his time overseas is that three-point Corner shot for gersan Lindy Waters his first minutes on the floor to start this second quarter a three-point shooter Kuminga now Tak it on Maxey for to shoot got to go Kuminga Draymond Green in the corner no and Maxey wants to push it George couple of early fouls pull up three is good Sixers needed that badly and now down and Curry Collide and D's got Curry duty to start this second quarter good luck with that Curry minutes are up here recently Steve cerr trying to get him more involved after protecting those minutes early and Lindy waters on the receiving end they are still sharing it Reggie 13 assists now for their 15 made buckets Maxey shakes Waters three-pointer good Waters overh help there which allowed Maxey a wide open three here's Curry now got three Curry knocks down another triple that's the problem if you're D junr you've got to stay attached to Curry can't give him that slither of daylight that's all it takes Curry's made two threes his first bucket of this second quarter already nine made threes for Golden State and bl by Waters D got stuck in traffic Curry leaves it for Waters three-pointer he can shoot it and he's got another one my goodness we've got nine minutes and change to play here in the second quarter Maxey drives hangs and lays it in Tyrese Maxey such explosiveness going to the basket oh look at goes right by D D's got no chance as amazing as Curry is the all-time three-point King what he does off the ball is equally as impressive catches it with a full head of steam and straight to the bucket he goes mismatch with George guarded by Waters George wants to take advantage of that little turn around jumper it's good got a friendly bounce start here to the second quarter by PG and splitting it is green he drives in Porous defense by Philadelphia you're being very kind there with your choice of words this is absolutely terrible defense I like porest though and that was knocked Away by Waters that'll be Philly ball Warriors have 18 points in the paint already they've already hit 50 and we're just four minutes into the second quarter as Ricky Council and a couple of Razer backs going at had it Council drink responsibly 50-32 the Warriors have been off since Monday had a loss against Cleveland on Monday here on this floor they beat Phoenix Saturday night on some of these Drive-In layups by The Warriors He's going to let these guys figure it out right because he wants number one you's got to find a solid rotation but they need to find a rhythm Martin snuff that one out jumps to Lane gets the steel Maxey with Kuminga on him and Maxey lets it Fly that's going to be a loose ball foul Council on his way in was pushed again byy two fouls that will sit Wiggins and Schroder return sher's off to a nice start H three threes already now green ends up on Maxey backseat and a kickball well the Warriors got a little cross from to you you switch out to him great communication there between the two something to note here shrewder grabbing at the back of his of his leg there as George hits another one so George regg he went for 20 first half points last night has found his stroke here in the second quarter he's got seven in the quarter Wiggins lost the handle Wiggins Rises up and finishes with those two fouls couldn't afford to be more aggressive well with ID on the bench you see if George that should have been a swing pass nice move but that should have been a swing pass to George Warriors almost gave it right back nice save by Schroder and now Martin with a steal and Martin stepped on the sideline and that's going to be Golden State ball came to more energy on the second of this B back to back he's got Joel embiid back on the floor for the Sixers defensively Eric Gordon gets his first minutes of this game as George misses got a seven-point quter going in the second shrer pushes and turns it back shter with Buddy Hield Lindy Waters Wiggins and Jackson Davis Jackson Davis shovels one to Wiggins for three Warriors are getting great looks from three-point r they've knocked down 10 of them 10 of 16 at this point this High screening roll between George who knocks down another one that's nine points in this second quarter for p their team but that high screening the roll between George and B this is something M Nur says he wants to kind of investigate a little bit more here going forward Wiggs guarded by George Cross Court skips it out to Waters and another three is good Lindy Waters doing what they'd hoped he' do he came with a lot of Praise from his previous stops had a great start to the year has been a little bit of a swoon but he is a shooter that can give you some instant offense Warriors are getting a lot of that tonight as embiid connects on a mid-range jumper just his third made basket and this is when in the high screen and roll when he catches the ball at the free throw line you are really at his Mercy because can do whatever he wants because of his ability to score the basketball hits the deck was looking for a whistle Wiggins able to score it embiid for a big guy is on the floor a lot he's got that facial fracture mid December he suffered that facial fracture he is good with the mass now he says it's more comfortable and he hardly notices it's on hedge pump face he can take you off the dribble he can step back and knock a three Tyler Ford just takes it all in takes it all in look when you've been in the association Tyler 4 this is his 10th season Sean Corbin 30th about that 30th they they've heard it all they've seen it all by the way sha Corbin's first NBA game Kenny Smith was playing what for the Rockets yes that's how long Shan Corbin has been in the NBA and he only gave Kenny one foul and 25 that was Kenny's box score that night 1993 was Sean Corbin's first NBA game and he's still at it Gordon hits a three coming off 14 points last night in Sacramento that was the first time he's been in double figures since early November made three threes last night Maxey got a block Schroder gets it back and now Wiggins guarded by George Wiggins tough shot over George Jackson Davis gets a rebound in front of embiid Jackson Davis coming off a career high 16 boards against Cleveland and he's going right at embiid and that's what they love about Trayce Jackson up a foul week of December unable to hit the first here upcoming National TV schle great to be back after a couple of weeks off New Year New Beginnings a lot of resolutions by these teams fun next four and a half month George misses the three embiid the rebound and Martin guarded by Curry passes up a three-point chance IID drives it inid draws the contact goes right at Jackson Davis see what I mean when he faces up and gets it at that free throw line there's nothing for Golden State I know they're up 13 and Philly has been a shell of themselves they have not looked great but they're Draymond only the one ejection this year that's probably the biggest stat of them all and Reggie just trying to find that line between being the aggressor but then crossing the line into a problem for the Warriors and certainly for the officials leaving it up top green another assist sets up kuminga Draymond is one of the one of the the most smartest players this game has ever seen that I've ever watched and I guarantee you because he is big on film work with watching a lot of film I bet you he went back and looked at some of the ejections and some of the technicals and said you know what I I probably didn't need to take it all the way there I think this is going to count too this should be n one yeah Tyler Ford just counted that with the foul to go there uh I probably pushed the envelope a little bit too much on that one on that ejection and he understood at times when he's off the floor obviously and in the back and the locker room from being ejected he's hurting his team so we've seen a better version of Draymond Green now he's still feisty now and he's still going to talk his talk but he understands that he's more valuable on the floor here well the window is closing quickly for these Warriors as Curry launches and hits another three-pointer Steph Curry to Third first warrior in double figures now curry with 11 Curry's got three sher's got three threes 12 made threes overall green with a steel Schroder pushes Wiggins running with him now curry curry patient drops it off no look Wiggins with a left hand Curry now with five assists as embiid hits the deck Draymond Green as embiid knocks down the free throw beid is not 100% but him running back to the paint and then you can build your defense from there I'll take that because then you have a rim protector but when you're kind of jog back I'm just not going to cut it Embiid missed the first nine games this is his 12th game played that's a dare shot and Draymond Green responds to that dare and look how he's looking at at the Sixers bench that is so disrespectful left him wide open greenberries his first triple now Martin pass fake misses a three curry with a rebound Kuminga up ahead Mar runs it down no b no B embiid surrounded by Warriors his closest Defender embiid's got his mask up here and take it on green double team comes Wiggins gets a block green runs it down giving up all that size but the Warriors are making it work that was also good help there by wiggan Curry ships he want a pass Kuminga resets it Draymond Green left open again missed that one now does Nick nurse point back at him or no no they're going to they're going to play the percentages that's what they're yelling From the Bench keep shooting Draymond analytics Maxey missed it here we go off to the races again Wiggins runs Wiggins denied by amid that's why you run hard back to the paint my exact point if you're Joel Curry draws the double green left open go ahead and he missed it and did you see Embiid just threw his hand up like go ahead and shoot it go ahead coming to the end of the second quarter at one point Golden State led by 19 after Moody's three to start this quarter Sher got a hand on it shrer little floater no good he had time sure did and Maxey lets it Fly oh off the backboard and the first half Schroder now with 11 points Maxey with Lowry George Caleb Martin and Joel embiid just the ninth time that Maxey George and embiid have started a game together for the Sixers embiid strikes first for the Sixers in the second half and the guys at half we talking about where ID gets it like now when he gets it at that free throw one and takes that shot see I like that shot for embiid because now that sets up the rest of his game now you're going to have Trayce Jackson Davis kind of crowded him and he can get around Trayce Jackson Davis embiid giving up a lot of size and Draymond Green is fouled by Lowry jerro Greenberg he had a chance to visit with Nick nurse one game left on this road trip they go to Brooklyn Saturday and then a three-game home stand late clock here curry with one Curry got it off in time missed it and here comes Caleb hardtin Warriors lead is 16 their biggest lead 19 that was right at the start of the second quarter embiid Jackson Davis on him embiid patient turn around round and out it goes that was more than halfway down Draymond green straight line drive able to score it saw a lot of that in the first half Reggie isn't that just what Jared straight line drivve no paint protection Draymond Green just driving down the lane for an easy lay in Maxey's fouled embiid is a rebound away from a double double he's got 15 and nine five of those points coming at the free throw line do that line more often we'll keep an eye on his minutes as well he played four straight before he sat last night he puts up an air ball here Jackson Davis running to the spot Curry Fires at three and hits it Warriors had multiple options there Curry shooting a three is always the best one curry with his fourth made three he's four for four from Beyond The Arc he's got 14 points Maxey and a foul back in transition when you don't give the effort on the screen rolls with curry their best players BR now again he's not in shape but whose fault is that that's the player's fault so he shap he is he could arguably be considered the best CER now I know jokic has that title and he's running away with it but embiid is in that discussion when he's in shape for Golden State as Caleb Martin hits a fade away jumper a tough shot down on the Baseline Warriors are passing it well moving the ball look at this High assist numbers green again Jackson Davis and undercut by Lowry not making shots when the ball's not moving when they're loading up on step and no one else can make shots it's very difficult for this Warriors team to win Curry draws the contact EDG on the Warriors because Steve CER talked to us about trimming down that rotation that means Anderson that means Looney are the odd men out right now what does that do for Shooters especially needing more offense needing more scoring they have not shot the ball well at all after that great need those guys we need their effort but we need shooting on the floor for us to be successful and what does that do for the shooters well with certain amount of guys Philadelphia foul this quarter I beg you pardon two shot foul here there Mike D leevy and Jared Greenberg you figure the Warriors are going to be active come Dre that I spoke to Mike dun leevy before the game who's the team's general manager and he he's going to spend the next couple of weeks truly evaluating he wants to see this team get better before he makes any reaction in over the last couple of years they've got some good young core pieces do they want to give those guys away for this year when they could have a longer Runway if they were to to keep those guys it's going to be an interesting next few weeks leading up to the February 6th trade deadline which is coming up quickly Reggie and also Jared they don't want to waste away the Steph Curry Draymond Green years with these younger players am I correct on that oh there's no question that is felt throughout this entire organization on a daily basis as cruder knocks down the jumper there's no question that the Warriors are are making decisions to Maxeymize this particular Window Guys you hear about the apron conversation the Warriors right now are up against that first apron and they're a little bit limited what they can do because they can only take back what they bring in they cannot take back a contract that would exceed what they send out so it's a difficult way to operate right now to make trades big can stretch to the three and knock it down Ste Cur made no bones about the pressure that his players are feeling with this window closing what has been an incredible run in the Steep cerr era and also you have Curry coming out as it is curry Draymond Green and Klay Thompson to a certain degree was a part of that founding Draymond Green that's going to be successful sellouts every night here for years to Wiggins finger roll lays it in okay got Embiid out on the perimeter and Curry with a quick decision to get it to Wiggins inside embiid drives it embiid is fouled on his way in four years been dominance by The Warriors here as Jerry stack house a former sixer good to see Jerry back on the NBA coaching sideline and talking with Steve Kerr earlier he is raving about the defensive effort in the schemes that Gary stack house has brought to this Warriors team in this league at some point and I just think he's doing a great job on the defensive in which is shocking to me because when I had to guard him he knew nothing about defense well had head coaching experience in the Raptors system in their their D-League back then and then a course the head coach at vanderville at the NCAA level for 5 years here's C for three and Embiid pulls down the rebound see if the Sixers have a run in them right here they are down 18 has not been a great night for Philadelphia and Joel embiid but he Cates a three and Joel embiid with 20 now he's got a double double with 20 and 10 Kuminga drives on embiid turned away You're the Sixers let's get this down to 12 10 with little under 6 minutes left turnover over by Wiggins ill advised pass Maxey running with Embiid George on the floor kcks it over to Martin Martin drives it Martin HS and it's by Green the wingspan got him Wiggins extra pass in the corner and now buddy Hield he lost the dribble gives it to Curry pure the alltime three-point King is raining him in tonight he's got five from downtown for curry 19.7 assists for curry he's got seven of the 28 Golden State assist Embiid take it on green turn around jumper no good settled that time that battling for that rebound and Curry love the hustle there another Curry three-pointer okay he called it he always surprises himself it counts Curry now perfect six of six from downtown we got to give him a half for that one ID with Wiggins on him drives it contact free throws for Joel embiid Curry banks in a three because it's Steph Curry he surprises himself even he's having one of those nights has not missed from Beyond The Arc 22 points six of six from three-point range performance and I remember when Reggie Miller was on that that list and nowhere to be found now Reggie it's you've fallen off the top five so sad did you see the headline they wrote for you I know that but that's Heights you know he's a hater yeah Klay Thompson just bumped Reggie out of the top five and dropping LeBron's about ready to pass me early next season there 90 something away Curry Harden Klay Thompson look at this Curry no luck to wiin another one down Curry's dancing on point you know at the top of this broadcast I heard Charles say this is a very important game for his Sixers right I know they played last night but in B didn't play and this Warriors team really got blown out by the Cavaliers two nights ago now he's making threes and look at this left hand oh left hand di r games only 11 tonight and they've kind of laid an ache here through three quarters top two by Curry I mean you've been there Reggie that that basket he wanted Dennis Schroder to go in curry blew it off Schroder said to cerr I can't go in for curry he wants to stay in cerr says to Schroder well if he misses it I'm blaming you curry made it gets a high five from cerr and says good job Dennis and now they're laughing about it on the sidelines as Curry gets a blow 13 in the quarter for Steph Curry scored eight of the last 11 he assisted on those other three as Reggie Jackson with a little floater and the Warriors are having fun at the Philadelphia 76ers expense 3 minutes remaining of this third quarter 94 points on the board for Golden State as Kuminga goes to work against Yabusele in and out there's embiid with a rebound Embiid staying in his regular rotation minutes 21 Points 11 rebounds for him be is Reggie Jackson comes out firing so the big thing going forward will always be the non steeping minutes right when he's on the bench him being a to generate enough offense without Curry and Draymond Green on the floor and that's when this team has struggled with this unit on the floor now kiga is play great a foul there sending embiid back to the free throw line but them offensively when Curry is on the bench free throws for embiid well foret NBA Allstar is back with a brand new are the GMS plus Candace will be uh the GMS picking the teams Allstar votes released today Giannis was the top vote getter over 1.7 million votes he led the East yic Leed in the west remember the starters will be chosen by the fans the media and the players fans get 50% of that media and players split 25% and we we got a new format at the All-Star Game and we'll all be there it'll be our last on TNT and we're looking forward to it and we're all coming right back here to the Bay Area for Allstar Week Philadelphia with a turnover on the carry final two minutes of the third quarter back into the zone here for the Sixers defensively but he heal misses the three embiid rips down his 13th board and embiid another foul drawn on Jackson Davis got his palms in the air and embiid's going back he's going to the free throw line to shoot his 12th and 13th free throw 10 in the quarter for embiid Trayce Jackson Davis picking up his third foul he is retreating one out of two for embiid 10 to 13 on the evening for embiid Sixers in the middle of a six game Road Trip spinning this middle window of the trip out west Moses Moody for three Moses Moody has a sweet stroke going tonight that's his third made three has not missed from Beyond The Arc 18 for 30 as a team 60% for the Warriors that'll get it done most nights long three by Gordon Jackson Davis with a rebound couple of hooers on the floor and Jackson Davis and Aaron Gordon is Kuminga going to work Rises up comes up short and a foul Gordon will be called for the foul try to give his team a chance what do the Sixers need in your mind for like a three and D type player because you can never have enough shooting with the way Maxey is able to penetrate and collapse the defense he can kick it out to a shooter and obviously mid is going to get double and triple team so as much as you can get shooting on the floor also too let's not forget Kelly Uber is not playing as well he's another player who can knock down three there's a big Euro Step there by Embiid Al Kuminga Jared Greenberg what uh does Captain crunt say about the Sixers and their needs as we approach the trade deadline you guys are familiar with the saying right death taxes and Daryl M will make a trade before the trade deadline haven't heard that count on all of that there's no question Daryl m going back to his day two trade deadlines it is almost a foregone conclusion that he will make some sort of move be it big or small to improve to try and improve this Ro what a finish bying work angles and play one-on-one basketball yet he's getting there slowly but surely but you see glimpses of what this young man can do he's 22 and he's in a contract year he was in the league as a teenager to be young to the end of the third quarter and bees had a big quarter and he flushes one home and Joel a continues to stack him up he's going to finish with a big Knight 28 and 13 right now 11 of those points coming at the free throw line and be with five made threes this quarter Schroder is fouled by Yabusele 7 and a half to as a member of the Brooklyn Nets that average cut to nine in his first seven games as a warrior having one of his better games as a warrior made his first three3 rebounds six assists and his defense think about this he's been the 11 points on three of 11 shooting well he was great in the Olympics as well we talked about Yabusele of course Steve cerb and Embiid and Curry and the well Sher was us team you're right one of Thea and Yabusele was second team Schroder playing for Germany had a great run in Paris I mean mb's got his head down he's blocked he gets it back and it's an air ball so Embiid comes to about 15 years ago I should say and now he's got a 6 for six three-point performance going as we open up the fourth quarter 10378 Warriors by 25 it's Yabusele finds George George for three got it 17 now for George George could have uh very well been a Golden State Warrior at one point end up signing a four-year deal with the Sixers as Jonathan Kuminga rings in a three the 19th three-pointer for the Warriors 61% from downtown George fires again get it out it goes Jer Greenberg George he's happy in Philadelphia got a long-term deal but there were a lot of suitors this off season Kuminga lays it in yeah that 4year 212 million dollar deal not too shabby but the Warriors as as you mentioned didn't just make a run at George it was confirmed to me that the dubs were confident they were going to land George here in San Francisco as George will go to the free throw line however unlike the Sixers move so in the end he is now a sixer but also too the Clippers didn't want to see George in a Warriors uniform to face them in the same division in the same conference going apron team and not felt like they could compete for a championship that would hamper them not just for this year but for years to come so shredding the salary clean was a better move for them than taking back salary that didn't make them one of the upper echelon teams thank you great stuff there George in his 15th year as Draymond Green another nice feed green lays it in that's been a big story tonight for Golden State their sharing of the basketball the ball movement in general and it's showing up with big assist numbers tonight at 22 assists in the first half up to 33 Council fires and there's Kuminga with a rebound by the way George is is approaching an NBA scoring Milestone he's got a chance toh get inside the top 75 he's got his sight set on Rick Barry the great warrior George needed 25 tonight and George with 19 he six away from going inside the top 25 here's a bomb by Curry and he rattles it in and he's seven for seven wow are you kidding me I mean that was from Oakland what a night for Steph Curry mie short Curry the rebound he's got 27 points nine assists as well he's just feeling it okay what is going on here what is absolutely great moments Through The Years with Steph Curry nobody in NBA history has more games with at least eight made three-pointers than Curry and it's not even close he's got 85 now Dame Lillard is second on that list with 31 and by the way it's the the eight for eight sets up Moody that time Steph Curry number 30 with an even 30 thus far tonight and the Warriors just running away with this one surprised KR has not pulled Curry and Draymond here looks like the Sixers have thrown in the whitew what a man something special Draymond Green to Kuminga Curry Looney Waters Anderson this is Edwards but then Bona is on the floor as well running with dowon nurse has pulled the plug on his starters Curry not to take a three I'm saying take one no no nine for nine fire St oh he was there and he kicks it and Moses Moody and there's the assist number that he was looking for curry double double that's his 10th assist and green commits the foul to get Russell Westbrook all these guys are turning back the hands of time and they give us vintage performances each and every night they make not be able to do it for 82 games in each and every night we get glimpses of why they are so special 630 point game of the year for curry this year Waters Anderson Looney G Santos and Spencer on the floor for the Warriors you got Yabusele counil Dowtin Edwards and a Adem Bona and these guys is going to get a good run here the Warriors just pouring it on Philadelphia is going to head to Brooklin after this one finish up their road trip Sixers then will will have three at home they've got Phoenix Washington and the Pelicans on their home schedu their schedule gets really tough in mid January on into tonight Steph Curry I get asked all the time about some of my favorite Steph Curry moment certainly with you at Madison Square guard when he set the three-point record but the one that stands out the most to me is Council goes in for the two-handed jam it was in a playoff game in Portland mhm and Curry scored 17 points points in a 5 minute overtime think about that 17 it was uh one of the alltime Great Performances I want to say that was a closeout game too on the road in Portland Lindy Waters oo shiy with the left hand wat and also too we got to say this too at the end of the day if your Nick nurse in the Sixers this is only one game right this is the team that had won 10 of their last 14 they were trending upward they had a terrible loss last night if they want to compete at Easter Conference number one their defense has to get better embiid will have to get in better shape question of that they've got the talent they're going to have to mesh that's the real story tonight that you had the big three on the floor and they're getting run out of the Arena tonight as Waters misses the three boner there with a rebound by the way in case you're wondering the most threes made in a game without a Miss is nine jayen Brunson did it a couple of years ago against Phoenix he was nine for n Ben Gordon did it twice wow had a 9 for N Run from three-point range you want okay I get I don't want to CH it but I'm going to need Curry to fire one up we're going to have a record setting night Spencer drives oh Bona just wiped it out give me all of that rejection that and where did Adem Bona go to school Reggie well there's a lot of people out here that attended UCLA obviously for the for the Warriors you got Loy Champion a block from behind Gui Santos Anderson oh here we go I didn't know we were going around the horn I said there's a lot of people out here in the corner Ricky Council Tay what Bruins women's team is making some noise number one team the country yes I'm with you Miss BS let's do it Anderson the Bruin with an and one in March there is be going to be great it is going to be electric Juju she was awesome last night I think she had 26 or 27 last night Juju is the real deal yeah she is she's fun to watch women's game is strong and she's already ahead of pace in terms of points than what Caitlyn Clark was at this point of their career tell you some of the biggest stars at the Collegiate level are on the women's side a lot of great matchups Council just lets it fly from 30 it's the front of the rim he Santos Find Spencer former cross player he's looking for Looney got to be tough for Looney the Milwaukee native he's he's had some great years here he's out of the rotation now yeah but a true professional and understands whenever his number is called he's going to give that effort Champion Bruin I didn't want to go there but thank you now was in the corner coming to the closing stretch here don't forget inside gang will be in Studio anxiously awaiting their commentary tonight and we're back after a couple of weeks off enjoyed all the Christmas Day games on ESPN and ABC strong ratings from Christmas day as well and now we're kind of into that window the new year I felt like I should have said something out loud like send it to the universe they say you send it out there it's you receive the where he's shooting him he's actually pretty close to us he can hear us that's true we did look up your uh the most consecutive Reggie militaries was five in a row that's it we're efforting six in a row the perfect games that's it you're no misses I think you had three of those five for five three-point games if You' have made nine threes in a game just think of the headline Smith D Davis Antonio Davis would have strangled me if I would have shot that many threes don't be so selfish our uh our crack research staff says in your last year in the NBA you had a five for five three-point game I'm sure you were thinking about not retiring here's Looney Looney with a good catch and trafficing fou he go to the line Looney and San Francisco they've got Brooklyn and then they'll be back home for three welcoming in Phoenix they've got Brooklyn Saturday that'll cap off his six-game road trip Sixers will drop to 13 and 19 Edward strong move to the basket he playing in his fourth NBA game Warriors are going to go back over 500 22 made threes for Golden State tonight 41 assists in the game there a big number as well Curry for 30 passone at another assist 42 helpers on 5 assisting on all the 10 it's a season High by the way for Golden State 42 assists 61% from the field 56 from three Anderson drawing the contact slow all good in fact when Cleveland was here a few nights ago they were playing a lot of Zone Steve CER was saying to himself see this is when I use those guys I need the IQ on the floor yeah I need these guys against the Zone but he had already committed to this rotation and didn't want to shake up the rotation that fast Warriors are interesting I mean they got a a window now they've got golden state with a backto back this weekend and then Miami is here Tuesday this long home stand the Warriors are on and this should take us to the end it is a whistle from suash meta with five left play until the buzzer goes off don't mind it they're com that one play Steve cerr is going to bring me the rest of my 75 cents from that IOU he from my Bruins dominated an IOU come on man what was that from USC Arizona game yes we always have a dollar bit we call it our Trading Places moral foreign foreign speech
