 ball like the old as we are often running here in OKC this place has become one of the best venues in the league of course all those great years with k b and Russell Westbrook they have reinvented themselves with this young Dynamic group and they get right to work with Luguentz Dort banging in a corner three just crazy to see how he has developed Grant as a three-point shooter well every year is improved on his three-point percentage Brunson misses wildly follows his own miss the shot clock didn't reset and brunson's pass for Bridges is picked Luguentz dort the interception H the Williams a little bit too much and the rebound underneath by towns see this OKC win streak a little bit of an asterisk remember they lost in the championship game of the NBA cup couple of weeks back against Milwaukee but that doesn't count so the windak grant is still intact it they can act like it never happened and fact to win tonight matches their longest win streak in franchise history going back to their Seattle days as Dort misses a wing three and then the rebound carobs out of bounds and belong basket and can make good decisions and made a great one there finding Dort in the corner but look New York you got to Value the basketball OKC they love to turn the ball over 20% of their points are off of turnovers and of course OKC they have to rebound against Karl Anthony-Towns in the interior of the Knicks tough shot by Brunson as he goes glass the Thunder coached by Mark dagol number one defensive rating team in the NBA they are the definition of elite at that end and speaking of elite Gil's Alexander silky smooth look like Curly Neil right there where he's got so much in his Arsenal as he's given the Thunder the early three-point lead well I love this match though the elite offense of New York against the best defense of OKC is OJ Anunoby knocking down a three-pointer OG Anunoby 35% from three it's actually his lowest threo percentage second lowest of his career as the Thunder have the quick answer with Williams and Williams so good off the bounce loves to drive right left excuse me but was able to change to that right hand at The Rim Oklahoma City 28 and5 number one team in the west remember they got the one seed in the Western Conference playoffs last year before falling short the semi-finals against Dallas Brunson Corner three well short Hart goes a little bit of everything for Tom Theo's Knicks and now's going to reset on the bounce to Bridges Karl Anthony-Towns gets his first touchdown low and makes it look easy over the top of Williams well first of all Second Chance opportunities there great offensive rebound and then the team awareness to find Karl Anthony-Towns with the mismatch inside boy you just think of how towns has change this Nick team Haren Stein that's his patented little leaning baby hook shot you see Hart is bringing the ball up more as of late a little bit of a point guard at times and hartenstein is matched up with Hart they're going to DARE him to knock down that three-pointer on the perimeter Mick beginning the night boy beautiful back door cut it's there isn't a better passing team in the NBA the angles the back door Cuts they can expose any defense it's a four-point thunder lead boy beautiful cut speaking of that Hart smart play on the dive to the rim and speaking of connected those two have been connected for quite a few years going back to Villanova podcast stars now Hartenstein again with that leaner a little bit too much rebound towns Micks beginning the Night 24- 10 number three team in the East Bridges it looked like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander took a shot in adverting elbow Bridges giving him a little tap on the backside to the season but he has really come on over the last couple of weeks for the Knicks Williams able to fight his spot again and I'll tell you Williams is so talented been playing at an Allstar level this season impressive numbers and go get a basket and once again category it's impressive Williams on the attack into the corner for Dort KAS Wallace now to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander high off glass the interchangeable pieces that Mark EG had his his has at his disposal just something to behold as Brunson sets up Anunoby cash money on the Baseline and a great drive there by Brunson but you saw five Defenders converge finding his teammate that might be there a lot tonight for the Brun for Brunson gilis Alexander underneath now to Wallace on the leaner misses badley in the rebound Bridges Knicks one to run har doesn't have numbers with Anunoby he's going to attack s and puts it in nonetheless Mark D's going to stop it here both have 10 points in the paint three games in four nights F th though been perfect on the back end of back to back 6 and0 up to this point Williams free throw line jumper missed it and towns trying to start things here for New York a new look New York team compared to a season ago those two massive deals Bridges well he backed down Shai Gilgeous-Alexander you don't see that very often as Bridges using his game in the post two good physical players s going right back at him and he travel former all defensive player in 2022 defense the two big deals we acquire bridges in July towns in October and this New York team after that slow start has taken off here going into 2025 Shai nice Denial on Anunoby but third in offensive rating they have been so good two seconds Bridges desperation heat not going to get it to go harste the rebound we saw Stein do so many different things last night including playing good ball defense out of the perimet there is s as he got a series of screens for hartstein you got to love those it's like wall absolutely as Hart got H up on the second one Creed him up for the three-point shot Bridges again in the post little shoulder bump and then the fade away jumper great to a slow start but he six points better in December than it was in October and November Shai bounces off got to the Baseline hartstein streaks in for the rebound Dort he'll spot up for the three he's got his second here in the first quarter realizing that Hartenstein did a great job keeping that ball alive man he took his time before he cast in those chips heart space too strong and the long rebound to Joe Hartenstein that extra hustle on that last possession Shai again down the lane takes a the extra hustle that has been showing up over the course of this season consistently just out playing your opponent out efforting your opponent he just Barrel his way in there around call Anthony-towns to get that offensive rebound or keep that ball alive well they just keep feeding who in favor of New York and Anunoby hostage dribble losing his physicality and then somehow just wedged his way in for that shot he's got a big body he knows how to use it he's got a variety of different offensive skill sets too extra pass over the corner it's Joe spotted up he had a good look from three come on come on come on three-point OKC lead first quarter Brunson has not been part of the scoring so far for New York don't find on the ball fake that's what he does so crafty always Shifty particularly around the free throw line below know he's only 6'2 but he plays a lot bigger because of his skill sets very smart player likes to get you in that hostage Tribble where he gets you behind him and he can control you with his dribble Mitchell knew it was going to be short called it out as Dort will'll try to stay with Brunson Brunson can do so many different things with the basketball but Bridges got it Wheeling around gave it right back and Cha no and Williams Will takes it away good job Williams just kind of forun him to miss that chippy Shai up top Williams there's a boom and an OK C3 okay Shai put in a whole lot of work to make that play possible for Williams will just go deep down into the Knicks defense to kick it back out to him AA and that's a nice pass Brunson setting them up that's what Brunson does he'll draw a double team and he's always looking not only for a shot but for his teammates already with three assists haral defer to the for the easy finger I mean sometimes you just got to go wow I know that's not a broadcaster's term but I'm a former player in his League that's a wow my goodness that's Hart too who for all those years that he's been in the league he's been a good Defender that's been his calling card Anunoby trying to to beat the shot clock Harts able to save it from going out of bounds Bridges tees it up in and out no good look at the Battle for the rebound last Touch by har this should be going the other way the course of his career guys yeah thank you Paris and he knows that he's got room to improve being in year number three and willing to put the work to do it Dort bouncing off the bodies tough Fade Away shot short but just over a minute to go he what has been an entertaining first quarter the rookie Mitchell is right there nice read by Joe taking that pass away you can tell he did a scouting report on on that particular play Joe the spin move on Brunson just kept it himself finishes off that turnover not normally you see him making a move like that a little spin dribble but you love the results yeah usually when I espresso got to have the the difference between a two and a three to five Brunson Maneuvers and it looked off balance there Brunson he can score in a crowd much like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander yeah you know he's small but he plays really big and he's a smart player too th want the two for one Joe missed the three and now that means that the Knicks partner at 27 and a chance to improve that Brunson six points in this first quarter see the stunt and that double team Knicks trying to break it and Anunoby had it punched away got it over to Bridges and bridges from the quarter as his big first quarter continues nine points shade a little bit of time splitting the defense and he's going to go to the free throw line for two I love it when you see guys like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander uh before the game folks if you get here early he's going to sign your autograph if you get down there by you know by the railings he will sign every single autograph as Bridges gets free for the three he's got that shock but I watched him tonight again you got to know the guy's tired this is three games in four nights with the Thunder by the way in case you're wondering folks he still started at one end went all the way along the Baseline well not the basine but outside of the Baseline and you look at the numbers clearly what stands out the shooting by both teams High numbers high scoring oh Ajay Mitchell Just dribbled Right Around cam Payne got to the cup and once he gets close he's almost sure handed bucket oh this a great move too once you got him behind him on his side call it a hostage dribble just kept it back there there no one at The Rim pounds not going to get that CAU Bridges he been feeling it that fade away not going to go down for he had 27 in the last game that he played Hartenstein fortunate had an outlet there wanted to get that ball back to Mitchell as Mitchell once again try to go the same spot on P and he's going to get fouled wow Ben Taylor on the Baseline says foul is Mitchell free throws a temple between these two ball cles so far but when you're shooting such a high percentage I it's not a whole lot of free throws available good physicality in the first half har one of those fiscal players skip pass over to Bridges he's been looking for his shot does so again nice rebound Kenrich  Williams puts his head down attacks but Landry Shamet the good steal like Kenrich  was going to have nothing but space Williams with the deflection it's loose on the deck that time Kenrich  able to scrape it up send it up to Wiggins and Hartenstein's pass too much steam intended for JD trying to create that three on two I thought he was thinking that JD's going to spray out to the corner realize he was that close and now it's Ajay Mitchell's turn to give a foul back to Cam Payne Cam Payne just looked at the official like it's hard to gauge when the officials all of a sudden say we going to clean this up a little bit you know you just kind of have to wait for a couple of fouls Williams got his hand in there knocked it away from towns reminiscent went towns was with Minnesota Wiggins off the catch Kenrich rips it away from towns and Hart able to avoid going out of bounds on the Baseline Williams's kick ball will'll keep it with New York especially with Karl Anthony-towns around the basket he's almost 7 feet tall now Williams got a lot of experience defending him all those matchups with Minnesota the four last year previous year thunderwood goes small now T towns trying to go on the post and they're going to call the foul this time on JW you can see towns trying to get physical with him in the contact secondary came from Williams which may have triggered the foul by the official initially you like the physicality in the game it's been a physical first half Ajay Mitchell again maneuvering and goes with that left hand as he's getting more and more confidence scoring at The Rim you know that strong body can really take that kind of contact all the way to the basket he's gotten there a couple of times already in this quarter he's not light either Michael he's a player that played four years of he's built out he's got some strength towns got down low and he's the last one to touch it hobi obviously Williams Do's giving up about five or six inches with man it is not a factor right now Mitchell contact how about the rookie just continuing folks he's just a rookie a couple of times he he doesn't act like it when you buy release a newy participating Oklahoma City area Kia dealerships you're eligible to receive two Club level tickets to an upcoming Thunder game tickets are available on a first come first Ser basis while supplies last and Ajay Mitchell he got 10 plus points now Michael and four out of the last six games he's approaching that again defense came into training camp ready to go those four years at UCSB this has not blinked at all here in his rookie campaign the battle ongoing between Williams and towns and Anunoby just takes matters into his own hands with a three and so he and bridges right now the two Knicks players in double digits Mitchell again the touch a little too strong Shamet into the front Court heart size jsh Hart always tried to insert his physicality into a game just didn't quite feel right after after training camp the exhibition games so much so that he had to kind of be talked through it a 24 well you know he's one of those energy B guys for the Knicks you know always willing to do the Dirty Work the unsung hero the Knicks certainly know how valuable he is he also plays with a degree of toughness as well look at Ajay Mitchell doing it again breaking down that Knicks defense started at the perimeter fighting through some physical defense he got to the rim and there was just nobody there again like that reverse layup he had and pay on the other end no that's Tapped Out Williams able to track it down in stride W trying to put it down that's going to be a goal on OKC that is this look like a Miss did you see something did you see you're allowed to touch the rim on a dunk yeah but it didn't matter once that ball had popped backwards cuz he had kind of you know a little bit lost his altitude a little bit ball was off the rim Brunson oh he's just so Shifty the thing with Brunson you just cannot bite on the ball f back door cut that time Brunson was ready for it intended for Wiggins he'll set it up as Hartenstein missed it and the towns follow ties this game at 41 Wiggins leans in left hand lost his balance still able to score that was pretty look at these teams going back and forth har and he got the friendly bounce this is a speed you want to keep it at the Thunder top timel just got teed up and that's exactly what he's looking for is how you're right Michael how did he get Dragged In yeah I mean good minutes here by Mitchell this time over to Cason Wallace coming up on the Midway point of this quarter Mitchell again got down low kind of rushed that turnaround shot a little bit as s is going to pop off the bench towns and he had the positioning that time the Deep catch and nobody able to come over and disrupt towns as Williams got the little hostage dribble Going Up and Under off missed it right Rich shooting 57% bson and Anunoby from the outside off the catch and between him and bridges right now the two of them are knocking down all the threes that the Knicks need percent that Knicks offense has been able to find enough open looks mostly for bridges in Anunoby counts to six har look at that defense Wiggins he was blinking in him beautifully didn't commit the foul either oh he just waited for him to get that shot up th trying to drive in Wiggins off the catch Corner three that's a shot that he's been making with regularity over the last year plus as brunson's going to get fouled now he will go to the free throw line to play that brand of basketball to play physical to not commit the foul as Brunson now leading score for New York over 25 points per game and what's been a big difference in the last couple of minutes is that the Knicks have been able to slow the Thunder Down get them into a halfcourt game which is to their advantage and I see that quick play on a made basket all the way down deep in the paint Shai scores there's going to the cup that's a matchup that you really like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander having another first half Bridges and it punched away good defense and the recovery Shai Gilgeous-Alexander three on one gives it up Joe there's some transition opportunity but it's Anunoby back the other way and OKC is going to commit the foul and put him at the free throw line and you're going the other way have lead so the Thunder getting some leverage out of just getting the ball the floor quickly on a ma or a missed basket sh again with Bridges defending and you get a hand check and a foul what'll be the fourth foul a 6' 11 wingspan Joe on the flare out 7 Seconds have to make something happen here they give the ball to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Shai giv the clock to check holds up M range shot too strong towns trying to speed it up and Anunoby looking him use that big body got surrounded outside Bridges boy the Knicks right now are not missing certainly not from the outside there's 58% from the floor they got their biggest lead of the game Shai mid-range shot no good falls off the rim so a little air stretch trying to get the offense United Bruns in no and the F on the weak side Shai again dumps it off wigg Hill scoop it up and in and I like the funder just continue to just just play with Pace the Knicks are kind of doing a little bit of that themselves they're staying on that high percentage as you brought up both teams are still shooting very respectful Nick's at 57% the Thunder almost 53% Talons works his way inside towns three straight games scoring over 30 points Shai bounces off the bridges did everything but finish he got down low missed a short shot and Har trying to attack through a couple of Defenders and that time Hart finds the deuce two minutes and right now it's the Knicks offense that can't be slowed down got 31 points here in the second quarter Kenrich bounces off the TOs and he will go to the free throw line valuable so many different ways support your community and can two for two at the line the Thunder can force the Knicks into some difficult shots on this end know and and that's going to happen this going to happen over time right now the Knicks are going through their run right now and Anunoby off the catch that time that was a clean look just a bad miss Shai once again attacks Bridges up top Williams open three can't convert dor battling with towns and Hart putting pressure on the defense yet again with Brunson working down low and did a good job of staying on his feet Bridges and that's too easy Nick's very patient on offense and so far they're the ones done a lot of work that top Bridges with the block and Brunson quickly into the front court now the switch is Brunson are caught momentarily har outside three New York is having themselves a first half here 60% shooting four different players in double digits down low blocked trying to get some points back quickly and now the Knicks can settle for the final shot here on this first half biggest lead of the game for the Knicks since right now at 14 little pressure there trying to get the ball out of brunson's hands Bridges will take the three no but okay see what time 5 Seconds Williams trying to push K rich and they'll lay it up and in for New York in double digits Brunson was one of them with 10 Works underneath nice strip and a steel Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Dort was also right there in the vicinity the kick out Wallace off the catch Corner three Cason Wallace quickly gives OKC a bucket not only a steal and a turnover but a nice transition opportunity see like the Thunder got a lot of Leverage when they a to get that ball up the floor quickly and score question is Michael how do you Force some of those principles and fundamentals particularly on the defensive end that Dave Bliss was talking about just be patient let it happen and and right now you let things happen you're forcing the Knicks into what backto back turnovers with an opportunity to cut into that deficit D top of the key three missed it the Knicks not afraid to go at OKC in the first half there was some aggressive style of play guys like Brunson this time he'll take the three left it a little bit short usually you see him going down low trying to get around the free throw line Williams bouncing off the Defenders counts the rebound Bridges can you cool him off at those 19 points that he had in the first down and that's on the leg of bridges out of bounds he was smart to not challenge that Williams attacking towns goes right at the cuts it up and in got their wi here in this third quarter got a little bit more bounce to the legs little bit more activity give it a little space out to Hartenstein on the perimeter there's a switch Brunson pulls it back out and you commit a foul there with 3.7 he just he's got a nice build to him too he just kind of waits for the defense to make a mistake how about that another mistake that time by the Knicks Hartenstein read the pass he's been so good on of the perimeter had that strip steel last night Shai Gilgeous-Alexander step back three no good offensive rebound K take to Williams rips the cords from deep and it's a quick start out of the gate here in the history of the NBA trying to write the ship in Golden State they have struggled in November and December but got to win against Philly last night OKC coming out of the timeout here Micha the first eight to the Thunder here in this third quarter and to get a k this third quarter towns Bridges extra pass Anunoby outside too strong weak out rebound towns and he just uses his height that time flat footed but when you're sevenet sometimes you can do that absolutely and he's kind of like a flat footed three-point shooter as well hasn't been able to get a good look at any three even attempted one SJ bouncing off the towns body bump and free throws now quick word from your Oklahoma Ford dealers he's just showing you I'm Still The King of Threes as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will keep the thunder right there in the rearview mirror of the mix here put a lot of pressure on him in this third quarter under half to switch defensively and Anunoby now inside towns with defending T the quick Karl Anthony-towns goes with a left hand they trying to get him in the post you can see that to enforce his Sid Shai Shifty and they're going to call the blocking foul on Brunson that time he wasn't I agree I agree that yeah sh mid-range shot too strong and hardin's going to get CAU for the loose ball foul who's picked things up for the Knicks offense everybody they try to get him in the post again this is what they've done here the last couple possessions all the attention that he's gots kind of wait for that b to get sprayed out to him that's a good point and towns goes one for two he's already got 15 rebounds so another double double for him Shai trying to get downhill the kick out Wallace that's a dangerous pass the Knicks may have been locked in Bridge is another player who New York has utilized the post here's keep running the exact same play made away shot no and Williams on the break two on two momentarily Anunoby is going to commit the foul that's going to put Jade up at the free throw line be here at paycom Center Sunday at for our next city night versus the Boston Celtics thunder.com buy tickets going to continue on the road and the Thunder go and take on Cleveland take on this New York team we got the Celtics the defending champs coming in an early game on Sunday afternoon here PS in a rare early tip time as Brunson breaks down the defense with his dribble the Knicks have two bench points Williams pulled the string out of bounds this keep getting those stops keep forcing those turnovers just kind of you know like a wood chipper just chip away at it don't allow the Knicks to go on those big runs like they went on the bottom part of that second quarter that gave him a 12-point lead at halftime and we know top Lio likes to play certain guys Bridges leades the league in minutes per game as Brunson no good he got down low that was close Williams one on Three decides wisely to pull it out waits for a teammate it was Cason Wallace flying in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander oh the reverse left hand couldn't get it to go brunson out anunoby and the Knicks regaining control of this game pass the mid back in Rhythm a little bit after the Thunder Came Out Swinging in this third quarter w oh good him the three by the tenor of this game for the thunder on the offensive end far different here in quarters two and three then in that first quarter when they put up 33 points that offense hasn't been there s again goes high off the window as he got a white down into the camera well he got laid out on that one tough finish my goodness this time Anunoby going in the post nice steal but the Thunder give it right back towns strip they just play to combin 17 minutes seven-point game okay C seems switching everything Brunson Shifty Jade trying to keep him out of the lane too strong on the layup attemp with both Thunder players right there for the rebound and towns with the putback you had Williams and Hartenstein fighting for it feeling good enough to knock down that first free throw it is doing its part but the offense hasn't been able to take it to the next level low scoring third quarter towns is taken forever I'm glad that's over good we can get back to the game now wow Williams tough fadeaway shot in the post he's missed some mid-range shots atypical inefficient night for him seven out of 18 bridges in the post got a little high advantage on Joe tries to get inside short tapped out right to Joe see if the Thunder can put together some possessions here on the offensive end Joe off balance and Brunson back the other way got to slow him down they don't and it leads to the r know he takes a huge th on the deck well you can hear that from here as he came down real hard that is not what do you want to see on a dunk Jam in transition and the Knicks right now are imposing themselves on OKC no unnecessary contact on the play it's just going to be a common foul it's going to be one free throw to OG Anunoby and we resume play that way and that's what I saw I mean you know it's unfortunate that pierce this New York defense that's been hard to do towns is out of the game New York's going to play small as the Knicks have built up that lead the Thunder got to within four early minutes of the third but the Knicks have completely regain control of this game Williams getting his spot and that goes down for him that's what you like to see coming out of the timeout but can you put more of those type of possessions together on the offensive end just string together little stops you know that's going to be the key for the Thunders just continually to get stops and slow down the Knicks offense and so Brunson with the Miss but if your OKC here you you want to keep playing that aggressive any foul here for the rest of this quarter is going to put New York at the line well you know I think that's way at folks there's nothing nice there's nothing clean about playing defense you got to gamble that's a big part of it and they did a lot of that in the top part of us some turnovers from the Knicks that brought that deficit down to just four points D has to sit on the bench for fouls gets that mid-range shot to drop in and the Thunder still stand very much for this stking thises they short run away of get right back in it just feels like the dicks have really held serve over the course runson fires away from three short no good and Ajay Mitchell played quality minutes in the first half spinning away Williams three is going to be short way short offensive rebound Wallace and the put back doesn't go but he will get a trip to the line much needed free throws keep the offense going as now the aerial assault is done now and now it's all about hand toand combat every possession has gotten more and more physical and it's gotten AR makes some noise for defense defense still a lot of time here to go in the third quarter Brunson high pressure on him see two Defenders Achiuwa over to Shamet Tom tiido trying to steal some minutes from his bench Brunson got down low offensive rebound too strong in the put back AA missed it trying to push Williams Wallace Falls on the floor how often does that happen spread it out give it right back look at his feet kind of got crossed up on there unfortunate but right idea man for presses a che to miss that dunk at The Rim Shamet got it right back and lays it up and in so you see you see Achiuwa and shamet played minimally in the game Shai up top it's Williams spotted up for the three and the Thunder could really use one from downtown and it's Williams giv the much needed bone now about Shai going deep into the paint once again and kicking it back out giving him enough time to line up that shot now they're going to give this foul again to Brunson and let's get an update from Nick well guys Williams Williams Will has a made three in six of his first seven games since he's come back really remarkable for him to find some Rhythm here after missing so much what Williams Will is all about when you see him on the bench he's screaming and he's hooting hollering it's all about the competitive fire that's within him certainly brings a level of Charisma that's just infectious Williams going left put it on the deck seems like the Thunder a little sped up on the offensive end things Brunson stripped in the lane was a TR Shamet outside Bridges High release and the three goes down that is a big shot by Mel Bridges that's his first bucket of the second half yeah Brunson got got away with a walk on that play and that's a big play for the Knicks too because they were able to get a three out of that still time to work with on The Possession s a that three nothing but n long see if you can get a miss here by New York that's just a big shot maker that time by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Brunson rumbling down too strong Town strong on the put back and the third effort is a chea inside two offense that last possession for the Knicks really frustrating for OKC they thought that they had chea did not look comfortable in his first free throw makes the second Chon Williams the ball in the hands of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander bridges that Wide Wings spin trying to keep him out of the lane Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Barrels in oh he does not miss that short shot very often but that is the kind of night it has been uncharacteristic misses for him you don't want to foul here if you're the Thunder Achiuwa Corner way off H the side of the backboard can the Thunder inject enough energy here in this fourth quarter to extend this winning streak well just continue to to get stops you're slowing down the Nick's defense you know and just try to get back in Rhythm offensively we like those quarter numbers for that third quarter be able to slow him down and be contested at the r Harin met him right the cylinder Williams cutting down the lane there's a two and those are the types of plays we're talking about in transition not allowing the Knicks to set up their defense just get the ball and go saw all that action had three jerseys right there waiting for Anunoby go right back to towns in the post trying to back down Williams du double team comes now an Anunoby two seconds hesitation tough shot fing away short no good that's those kind of stops we're talking about forcing the Knicks into a hurried situation Williams wants the three nice rebound Wiggins Williams po down the lane that is vicious bur and dry off the mix offense this the closest that OKC got in the third Shamet dangerous outside little flat of the three Hartenstein the rebound of the big fella taking it up himself Wallace we are seeing some still a four-point game this the CL thatc got in the third for the next Rim but a rangle back a bigger lead Hart don't want to give him too much space he'll take that all day long that is just way too much Ash Hart's a good three-point shooter well he got screen that time by towns and went under the screen and Hartenstein did what he should do was take that shot Williams deciphering Joe back door cut Williams kept it himself Wheels in nice layup to avoid do Hart who was waiting for him trying to draw the charge yeah he was so athletic just kind of got up in the air and glided himself past towns down the lane but left the layup short Williams runs into a wall of Nick defensive players and wisely decides to pull it out there's a ton of time left to go 9 Minutes Joe little side step three not going to go that is way off Hartenstein able to save it the Wallace shot clock never reset it's Wiggins that three splashes home extra minutes well and you that too because after you want to establish yourself early in the final quarter they've done done just that with a nine to three advantage in points quick stunt on Brunson trying to get the ball out of his hands nice denial 3 seconds har again the step back three over hartstein no good and the rebound to JD and OKC an opportunity here to tie or go in front trailing by two the closest expend here in the second half Joe wants the lead and gives OKC the lead and that has been a long time coming as the Thunder continue to fight up that hill hard Clos out on Anunoby fortunate to maintain his balance bridges that three is off no good he's been quiet here in the second Joe thought about maybe pulling the trigger on another one I tell you he had a big shot just moments ago to give the th the lead Williams cut down the lane that pass a high risk no reward Bridges bounces offstein and the Knicks back the other way and take the lead against New York with on the bench as he hops off now ready to check back in at the next stoppage JD that'll be a kicked ball out of traffic in those passes and they gave him some man in a great spot here here if you're okay see the way that this game has gone down Hartenstein strong on the floater ther miss him looks that usually go down Brunson bouncing T and gets it and the last four go to New York the Knicks retake the lead despite the Surge from OKC still a long ways to go left in this game lot of contact Williams lacks line of defense oh the block there on Anunoby out of bounds now it made it go backwards off the body of Brunson the hustle just next level and a hard foul Williams going to go to the free throw line now you start to see the Thunder applying that at 46 so you've done a good job of just you know shrinking the floor making it tough going to have to do for the next 6 and 1/2 minutes and Williams just missed two at the free throw line thund been perfect 14 for 14 prior to those misses now you got to play defense again you play defense here in this second half got New York just 29 Points you're still trailing in the game though and Brunson gets that bounce and it's a 60 New York run this is what the Knicks have done Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leans in there's two more he keep looking at the official not getting a whistle that one was successful now this game get the sense that this game is going to go down to the wire here five and a half wson picked up by Williams pulls up no good defense forcing that miss Shai over to Wiggins wide open for three Aaron Wiggins another big time shot here in the second half he pay the price he has had some clutch shooting crowd on its feet here inside K off center Brunson now it's Wallace bounces off clows out hard on har with three very deep three no good Shai able to rip it away for the rebound trying to push hard got caught in the air threw it away didn't have anybody to give it to as Anunoby is shut off nicely and Brunson again going back to work right side Brunson puts it in and gives New York the lead that's a tough drive back Brunson on sh tall taller longer Defender use that Stout body he has Williams to Dort the kick out Aaron Wiggins yet again from downtown that's his third big time three and he's put at the put himself in the right spot realizing that the Knicks are trying to converge every time to thunder drive with the basketball you're right part just big shot after Big Shot for him it's closing time right now we're under five minutes towns going to work in the block turn around shot got it up over Williams now these two teams starting to change exchange leads on the scoreboard as the NES go back up 101 100 Shai back to wiggins balance Wiggins takes the contact he's going to the line coming from Deep and he converts the three-point play are the hottest teams on both sides of the conference who has not disappointed folks this has been another premium game two premium teams Brunson got to break down Dort off the dribble out of bounds that was we could be a soft pass a little bit too much for hunt to handle three minutes to go Dort Hartenstein off balance there's another one three-point play coming up he's going to the motion how is that not a continuation of Williams making a work not going to get it out of bounds OKC ball he'll get a recycle 14 ising up boards though two-point lead here in the fourth quarter the opp possession Shai that time he gets one to go below the free throw line and Shai's just been sticking with it Knicks have been making him work but he's still getting his that's where he's just a master at the art of scoring hard head out by hartstein and he forcing a turnover on Brunson had nowhere to go with the pass Wiggins again oh my W what a fourth quarter it's been just want to keep getting stops here th picked a good time to put together a 10 run it comes in the fourth quarter that'll be a foul on the perimeter they're going to give it to Hartenstein D picks up his fifth with two and change left to go Thor's going to stay in the game of course as he's trying to chase Bridges Brunson off the screen way too strong of the three but har sneaks in on the backside puts it up and in a much needed bucket for New York and Shai will get it across the timeline and try to run a little offense crowd remaining on its feet and what has been another high entertainment value game Shai bounces left hand what a scoop and score continues to shine how about the pressure by Brunson this terrific defense bridges is off the screen misfires wide right go good and the rebound to Dort Thunder doing everything right down the stretch here no Second Chance points on that one how about the thunder defense tonight limiting the Knicks to 37 points in the second half Hartenstein this time he is going to go to the free throw line towns B on the shot B he's probably missed some shots that he normally makes thunder not really in Rhythm at all offensively in quarters two and three Hartenstein misses both Brunson knows he's got to hurry takes it himself and gets to the rim and scores and so that's a huge swing that's a four-point swing with Hartenstein missing both free throws all of a sudden okay see missing some fourth quarter free throws need right now you still want to M the time off that clock but you got to score we got to get some points on the bo Williams up feeling the pressure hard pressure got around har kept it himself dumps it off Hartenstein the push shot that one goes just inside the block and now you have to stop the ball Thunder had a foul to give kind of for to let any time go off that clock they got to make a move quick wson kept it himself no good rebound Hartenstein and Shai gets fouled and that'll do it and you got Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the MVP chance rightfully so because this team has won 13 games in a row but they found a way to flip the script limiting New York to just 39 second half points they were shootting had a hot clip for most of the game that be the thunder right now just get one stop here ball inbounded to Brunson Brunson got to the rim and Bs it Inon seven-point game the Thunder just don't turn the ball over the kns are going to have the foul as Shai able to get it up take a little bit of time deflection Bridges and that was going to be Thunder basketball no matter what even though he saved it for going high level teams playing high level ball the Knicks are not going to foul here Wiggins will kick it out Dort he'll heave it up and cap off this mive fourth quarter run you talk about how hot both these clubs were coming in tonight's game folks let me remind you the Knicks came in with a nine game winning streak the hottest team in Eastern Conference and the hottest team in all of the NBA was the Oklahoma City
