 good evening everyone from Denver home of the NBA champion nuggets and finals MVP Nikola Jokic who faces James Harden as the Clippers search for their first win since the trade welcome to the NBA on TNT presented by State Farm game two of tonight's coverage of the inaugural inseason tournament is the West Group B matchup between the Los Angeles Clippers and the champion Denver Nuggets moments ago Nuggets head coach Michael Malone talk about they've lost five in a row they have not won a game on the road yet we don't lose that home jump on them we know we're getting a desperate team jump on win the first quarter together 1 2 hi everyone Kevin harand with the Sharpshooter the Hall of Famer Reggie Miller we'll check in with Chris Haynes moments from now why haven't the Clippers won with James Harden and people are being extra critical of the Clippers nowadays all in five since James Harden trade and with four future Hall of Famers in the lineup people question are there enough basketballs to go around I feel the Clippers best days are ahead of them once they Define the roles on this team as for the world champion nuggets they are the best and most complete team in the NBA led by Nicola Jokic the best player in the association and even without the services of Jamal Murray the Nuggets they continue to shine because of their dep Kevin all right Reds good job let's take a look at our starting five for each team they do go with Westbrook and Harden in the back court George Leonard and Zubac up front Reggie Jackson takes the place of the injured Jamal Murray the defense of Caldwell Pope Michael coming off a double double Gordon and of course Nikola Jokic the Clippers really stunk their necks out I mean on paper it looks like we're going to get another Hall of Famer we're going to have them join three future Hall of Famers it all makes sense the one thing is though as people have mentioned they all need the ball those four great players to be what they are calculated risk and speaking with head coach tyone Lou he's like look you're bringing in a guy a former MVP a perennial Allstar and what has lacked in their games so much pressure to score the basketball on kawh Leonard and Paul George now you add a guy who led the league in scoring a couple times and is pretty good at dishing out 11 assists the year ago it's an upgrade at that point guard position Kev our crew chief tonight Josh TI joined by Natalie SEO the referee the Umpire Matt Bowen to be with you guys and he did not say a word we had him miked up and he did not say one word that was his big chance here we go we wanted to get the referee talking folks and we go down low and it's Jokic and Zubac tries to defend big bodies in there Westbrook has it his motor is always high irpm as he takes it the other way and meets the defensive Michael find zubac Works in on Jokic Nikola against the rebound he'll run it the other way Galloping into Harden it's out to Jack and now here's Gordon hard inside into zubac it's picked up by Paul George and he'll go the other way physical to start this ball game by both teams George puts it up in in they like Westbrook in the starting group because he really kind of ignites the other four guys on the floor and it's the first four minutes for Russell Westbrook the energy the energy he brings at both ends of the floor here to get the Clippers going and they're going to need that Jokic coming off a historic triple double look at this nice pass cutting was Michael broken up by Westbrook look at that hustle nice play by Russell Westbrook and down Court thrown away Harden couldn't catch up with the pass from Kawhi we talked about the energy in the first four minutes for Westbrook almost created a steel up there and got it himself the Denver Nuggets are unbeaten at home they are 6 and0 the Clippers have not won a game on the road this year 0 and five so what you're telling me is something has to give something has to give Jackson's 15-footer Zubac the rebound and Russell Westbrook numbers are down but he is really facilitating and gets this team going Zubac inside over Jokic who grabs the loose ball Jokic the other night in Houston 36 points 21 rebounds and 11 assists we have not seen a line like that in 55 years in the NBA he thinks three he goes for two on the Fly got the Miss knocked it off to Gordon and over zubac Jokic is there fouled as he went up talking about in my open my opinion the best player in the game in Jokic and you see out here already playing volleyball to himself three rebounds coming off 21 rebounds just two nights ago in Houston so that 3621 and 11 line the league had not seen numbers like that in 55 years since Will Chamberlain did it in 1968 something else tonight from Denver the NBA on TNT is brought to you by the Kia tellu ride expro Kia is the official Automotive partner of the NBA I mean just think about the names that Jokic is being associated with oh I mean one of the greatest centers of all time in will here there's Leonard at about 21 points a game Westbrook is on top the taller and longer Michael on him slithering is George down the lane and he got to go start here by PG-13 quick four for him Gordon will take it and Jokic on top it's Jackson the former Clipper positions for the shot from 15 how well has Reggie Jackson played moved into the starting lineup because of the hamstring injury to Jamal Murray but it's affected their bench it has but I think it's going to make their bench better in the long run another turnover here by the Clippers and here's that move by Paul George look at that three black jerseys around them high off the glass for the Finish but what a smooth move he puts in there 3 minutes into to the first quarter Jokic looking down on this floor which is all for the play at the uh inseason tournament with George getting the Miss shot he'll set up he'll put up a three with a whistle on caldwell Pope on on a three-point shot Pope is a highly rated Defender leads Denver and Steels thought he had the kind of position he needed but they got Paul George at the free throw line where so far this season he is shooting 9 9 2% kcp is having an argument with the official Natalie SEO about Not Giving Paul George enough Landing space that's why the foul was called it wasn't called up top it was called down low on the landing by PG Paul George of emps Memphis on Sunday a loss for the Clippers 26 points seven and seven with a couple steals he at three threes and he's off and running last year he averaged 24 points and he's at 23 points a game so far in the early stages of this season already Paul George seven and the Nuggets four nice start here for PG Quarters on top good cut Good Feet Jackson will finish Jokic with the assist have bigs that can pass the basketball from that high post area it just expands your your offense C Leonard outside Caldwell pope got in the way off his hands and out of bounds shot clock at 15 about the back here by Reggie but more impressed the fine there by Jokic Jokic with that triple double has four triple doubles in 10 games this season so far what a match up here here Aaron Gordon and Ka Leonard Leonard inside over Gordon Michael has got the rebound Michael against Houston 25 points 10 rebounds in the loss at the Rockets knocked away the defense by Leonard Here Comes Westbrook when he gets going his first step is his quick twitch is something to watch to me this is how the Clippers got to play create offense from your defense Jokic bed around it up and a foul on the play as he was maneuvering to fire Zubac picks up his first still there by Leonard and it's Off to the Races get the ball to Russell in the open court and let him do the rest Westbrook turned 35 the other day he looks as fast now as when he when he was 25 he has a loss of Step as Jokic is at the free throw line and brings the Nuggets to within two Russell Westbrook I've always loved his game I mean a guy that brings it each and every night has play through injuries comes with his lunch PA and just wants to work hard yes some of the skills have diminished over the years but he just does a little bit of everything to make your team successful Harden finding a gap goes into Jokic Westbrook on top Michael is there diving to the rack picked up by Zubac and haes the ball Harden with the three James Harden knocks in the three and this is where the Clippers are going to have to get better knocking down that three baller that's what coach L told us look we've just missed some wide open threes we knocked those down and it's a different story Jokic will think a three and it's over two bucks Jokic now seven points four rebounds and two assists here early on in this first quarter the Denver Nuggets are in first place and a tie in the Western Conference a three right there by Jokic on TNT welcome back to Denver here in the first quarter Chris hes is witching yeah I was talking with multiple Clippers players in the locker room about James Harden and there is absolutely no concern whatsoever from this group they believe that they're going to get it together and I also talk to James Harden who said he's still trying to find ways to integrate himself he doesn't want to step on toes of other players at the same time he's still trying to get in NBA game shape and talking with some of the coaching staff they said they want James Harden to be himself meaning facilitate be that score but be aggressive and James Harden also had this message he said for everybody taking shots at the team and him right now he said now is the time to do it because they believe that they're going to figure this thing out they do they feel very strongly about what it could become Norman Powell is checked in for the Clippers rookie Jaylen picket is checked in for the champion nuggets Jokic threee rebound George Harden has free reign to play like himself those are the words of teron Lou the head coach of the Clippers so what did he say on not a system player I am the system yeah great line good layup it's Kawhi inside with his first two here's picket the rookie ended up at Ben state began at Sienna Caldwell Pope Jokic free to fire ni Jokic is really racking him up he's got nine already not even halfway through the first quarter and that's a nice down screen there by rookie pick it to free up Jokic George Dives inside and he finds his ninth Point Paul George the six time all NBA star healthy and when he is he is a terrific player Caldwell Pope on top Zubac comes out on Jokic and then the drive oh knocked away Zubac great great block inside hard two George trying to get right by caldwell pop lost it inside it's picked up by Gordon ahead to pick it in around James Harden a great transition valuable minutes for Picket What did Coach Malone tell us look he's going to get the first shot Off the Bench at that backup point guard position behind Jackson Another steal by the Nuggets KS off to picket Harden came inic good pass and on the doorstep he couldn't get it in Norman now coming off a 20-point performance against Memphis on Sunday in La Harden is on top Harden's already knocked in a three the hesitation the dve the bump in the deuce did you see how he us that right chicken wing he's so crafty isn't he huh right to the chest of Jokic so the Clippers have H seven to 13 nuggets have hit five of 14 Jokic takes it Gordon is alone in side and open so much attention every time he touches the basketball by the way leads the league in touches this year 99.9 which means he's touching the basketball every single time down the court already has three assists and that's laced in it's a three by Paul George he's got the stroke tonight looking into Gordon bumping into Kawhi with a foul called inside on the Clippers look at the downhill drive here by James Harden look at that right elbow that's how you clear space straight Talon Jokic move Norman Powell picked up his first personal foul at the free throw line is Aaron Gordon last five games he's average a double double Sunday at 16 points and eight rebounds and at three straight double doubles heading into that game playing at a high level make every three-pointer steal and assist mean more with FanDuel America's number one sports book download the FanDuel Sportsbook app today yeah but what's been more impressive for Aaron Gordon he leads this nugget team in Block shots and that's really where he's made his calling since coming over to the Nuggets has has been at the defensive end 12 block shots early on in his first 10 games here Christian braun is checked in for the Nuggets also Payton Watson has checked in George has taken a breather PJ Tucker has come in joining PO with the ball right now Terance Mann who had missed some early time with the left ankle sprain he is back inside Powell floater over Watson it's brown who's been in a bit of a slump he's out working on some early shooting before this one tries to work on Harden approaching three and a half to play in the first Watson got it drives on Tucker Peyton Watson is a second-year player out of UCLA coach Malone absolutely loves his athleticism especially at the offensive end but he thinks he has a chance to be a really fine two-way player Harden's got seven so right now we are seeing the best version of the Clippers especially with this smaller lineup you got PJ Tucker and they're just going to switch off on Jokic will spin on Kawhi and there's no defending that well how about the footwork right so M Malone electing to keep Jokic on the floor with this smaller Clippers unit Jokic has got 11 George on the Clipper bench with 12 the two high scores Harden coming off his worst game as a clicker Clipper has started very strong here in the first shot clock at four Brown defending Leonard outside for Harden launches a three rebound Jokic he's got six already here in the first pick it racing the other way cutting Gordon try again it pretty play great feed another two for Denver and Kevin there's no shot Blocker on the floor here for the Clippers so if I'm Denver Drive Everything To The Hoop everything should be in the paint for Denver two boxes resting got their first lead they have two trailing Harden man inside Powell could not lasso the pass it's Jokic with play inside 11 points six rebounds and just an undersized Kawhi this year by the NBA all 30 teams are drawn into six different groups these two teams are in the west Group B Denver is 1 and0 so far and the Clippers 0 and one the point differentials important too cuz it could be a tiebreaker if one is required work their way to Las Vegas early December there's a semifinal on a Thursday in the championship over the weekend I like money is at stake I do too I think the players are enjoying it the competitive juices are coming out you get a chance to get some early season Big Time matchups well after the first week you find sometimes that a little bit of the air is out of the sail just be like in every League there's so much excitement over Tucker that was a shot by Gordon it's picked up by Terance Mann who looks spry and healthy he's met at the other end there by picket here's Harden Harden so far with an assist and seven points Zeke NNnaji is on him he just got off the bench he tries to defend and Harden slips it in this is going to his right against Nnaji nice move there by the bearded one again playing downhill here he's got nine it's brown and draws the defense of Harden chiseling his way in on top the Nnaji he's G scoreless over the last couple game pick it is doubled Gordon with a three rebound by Harden and with Kawhi and PG on the bench this is the time for James Harden we just saw moments ago he's got to be ultra aggressive offensively here puts up the three Zubac is in that rebound by Tucker Powell the triple no that's tapped by the athletic and high leaping Terance Mann another offensive rebound can't keep giving this Clipper team two and three looks hard and way outside but three bad looks by the Clippers three bad threes here's picket strong physical player ground the screen switch on D Zubac defend pick it with a three he has played some minutes here seven minutes off the bench here already down screen to wide open yage nice assist and now knocks down to three both teams coming off a loss Memphis beat the Clippers Houston got at the Denver Nuggets there's a foul on Brown on top as a leaning Harden was ready to fight this is what he's so good at why isn't he shooting three he had a foul to give and I they I mean he looked like he had gathered and was going up all you Shooters are the same that's right non shooting foul come on just follow along here follow along here Michael Malone over there helping with the defense with the young players here's pal final seconds first quarter good gos and he was fouled on the play he was by Watson so a bad foul on Brown against Harden now Payton Watson shot clock running down here in this quarter just bodies up against pal yep got his hand caught in the cookie jar right there look at his left hand right there right on the wrist there of Norman Powell as I said Norman Powell coming off the 20-point performance in the lost to Memphis on Sunday he continues to adjust to the minutes to the roll as the entire team is adjusting since the blockbuster trade well they had a game plan going into training camp before the Harden trade right while they were in Hawaii and got off to a you know a decent start1 and then you make the trade and it's going to take some adjusting uhoh Mann who got it and snuck it up but it wouldn't go and Denver leads by two at the end of one NBA on TNT presented by state F nuggets by two at the end of one moments ago our Chris Haynes caught up with Aaron Gordon of Denver a I'm I'm a b down here with you a how would you my KNE come how how would you explain the intensity level during that first quarter uh I liked it I think we can pick up our energy a little bit uh just unlike the offensive glass it it crash heavy so I liked it though I like the intensity uh I think the I think the cup is bringing that energy out of people and particular James Harden over there trying to find their group they're trying to find their win sort of a desperation of a team right now how do you guys combat that well they're a really talented team I mean they got some Hall of Famers over there for real a really skilled group um so we just got to try and keep them out Rhythm um play harder than him make him guard on defense we get your breath a all thank you brother how the current players are talking about this in season cup tells you everything you need to know talking about the competitive juices as Christian braun goes Coast to Coast for the Layin the players are into this because every Tuesday and Friday night they know they're playing really for something yeah wins and losses I get it but it's bringing out the best in these players it's a shot by Paul George and it's a good one as he gets his first two in the quarter and 14 for the game going back to what brown did he defended Westbrook well defended the rim finish it the other end a very confidence building play for the seconde player Brown Caldwell Pope inside no one home Nnaji looking the other way George Brook and picked up by Mann he is a high flyer coming out of the rafs four rebounds Fade Away Westbrook book it Terance Mann is everywhere already four rebounds Off the Bench here for the Clippers Mann is somebody the 76ers really wanted in the lane Reggie Jackson gets it to go they wanted to pair him next to tyres Maxi yeah wouldn't that have been so oh my goodness talk about two guys energizers the league loves Mann good feed Westbrook Zubac Brown there foul called on Denver the Zubac was diving H laser thrown in there by Russell Westbrook Brown is second Zubac to the line Clippers come in number 11 in the Western Conference and looking for their first win in this inseason tournament with a look at 46-year-old ton Lou played in the league one a champion as a player championship NBA tonight on TNT is brought to you by Burger King combo your way at BK you rule right now if a walker came descending from the rafters what would you do right now with an open mouth and say thank you where were you last you were in Buffalo no wonder you're hungry Buffalo last night the Broncos now tonight the Nuggets you should have just jumped on the charter I may call the nuggets the Broncos who know here I should have jumped on it but they didn't fly home till today working his way inside sing through the defense Brown was fouled as he worked across the lane Powell was there here here again those winning moves there by Christian braun keeping the ball alive pal picks up his second Christian braun entering the season was going to be originally the sixth man but it hasn't worked out that way Jackson filled that role to start the season now that may change but right now and of course Jackson is starting for the injured Jamal Murray who's out another couple three weeks with a hamstring and Jackson will fly down the lane rebound Nnaji how about that W that was impressive love it love the hustle there by Zeke NNnaji not giving up on the play talking at the defensive end now he's got his hands full against a red hot PG Paul George money a three and 17 for Paul George two and two from downtown six of seven from the field for Paul George good feed Jackson cutting ni inside it's loose there again extending the arm fifth rebound by Mann here comes the heat check right here George inside around one Defender after another ping ponging off bodies Jackson three on one br Jack hammers it in and the j-hawk flying off the wing how about the no look pass though by Reggie Jackson beautiful play here by the Nuggets 33y old Reggie Jackson playing like E's 23 change of Direction Westbrook hooks it in Zubac cutting nice defense inside Zubac got it Westbrook cor it whistle inside Bo there is a lot of contact a lot of a contact how about this fast break here by the Nuggets look at this no and Christian braun with the finish this is how you earn more minutes in Michael Malone's rotation off the bench here plays like that Kev Zubac at the line Jackson picked up the foul at the line and he's a 59% free throw shooter reg and partner this is why the nuggets on the way to a championship where're so successful cuz Michael Malone is not afraid to go 101 deep it's a long season 82 games now we've added the End season tournament that's going to add minutes to guys so when you can play 10-11 guys keep guys fresh keep those minute counts low and then come April and May and hopefully June if you're lucky enough your starting five and your top six or seven are fresh for the marathon playoff season Here Comes Jackson oh look at this ran Powell was right there with the defense knocked it away and that necessitated him Crossing mid Court to get it Jackson held puts it up fouled in the play Powell again hits the deck and picks up a foul in the third on the valuable Norman Powell I don't know who was holding who looked like pal going down had the wrist of of Reggie Jackson Jackson will be at the line there still the the Clippers Reggie are still searching for that consistent rotation you talked about this and a recipe with Leonard and George and Westbrook and Harden to coexist it's it's going to take some time isn't it it's going to take 25 to 30 games right we won't see the best version of these Clippers until closer to the all-star break let's take a look at the upcoming National TV schedule tomorrow on ESPN cel Sixers and the Kings and Lakers in Friday on ESPN inseon tournament continuing with the kings in San Antonio and the Suns in Salt Lake City Utah for more on these games go to nba.com or visit the NBA app Westbrook and George Mann Zubac and Tucker that's the five for the Clippers as they go the other way in Westbrook Jackson got screen Nnaji goes on Westbrook Russell will try Nnaji is right there his defense has been important Off the Bench Brown outside caldwell Pope three and the reason why kcp is that wide open the yelling by Nnaji running the lane it sucked all the Clippers Defenders to him which allowed kcp that wide openen three each team is is at 33 so far and there's a travel on Russell Westbrook yon is going to check in back in the game as Jackson was getting a little feisty oh you got to love it here all right so Jokic will inbound Michael Jr is back in the game great minutes by Zeke Nnaji Yeah by picket I mean these young players again Michael Malone he's going to go 9 10 11 deep well he says you know here I am a coach of a of a championship team I want to win a championship play I want to repeat but I've got to develop four young players I got to develop my bench the youth is a big concern and still go for a championship that's a tall order and think about the two pieces they lost Bruce Brown who's playing great in Indiana Jeff Green who's playing great for Houston who's had a resurgent he was good the other game against on Sunday those two guys were huge and instrumental in winning that Championship with the Nuggets so here you see the longest 10e head coaches the Nuggets just gave Michael Malone a multi-year contract extension he's one of the highest paid coaches now in the NBA he's taken to five straight playoffs two Western Conference finals and last season a championship the first and only in the history of the NBA Denver Nuggets who came from the ABA decades ago here is picket Westbrook out in the way Jokic will try to finish it rebound Westbrook okay okay Westbrook takes in hard L it more defense by Denver defense was their foundation in the finals against Miami we saw it Jokic three rebound zots four they're making Jokic a volume shooter tonight as kawh Leonard knocks down to three his second field goal on the of the evening three of 11 now for Jokic but all these shots have been pretty wide open though they have 11 points on 11 field go attempt poked Away by Kawhi Leonard there's his defense on display Westbrook over pick it I will live with that Zubac the rebound new shot clock with which to work here comes Paul George who's put in 17 Leonard is put in five works on Michael shot clock at two Gordon defends a three by George on the move it's picket Caldwell Pope three he just hit from there and he hits again Caldwell pop puts it through he's got six making shots that's my Swagger you feel me I got to get back to the basics first then I got to get my Swagger you feel me I'll be all right though this my fifth game watch I got to stick the land and like go back to the fundamentals of Bas shot stay there to the ball going in you know what I mean State Farm audio assist Leonard works on Gordon across the lane lost it in there another Clipper turnover Harden trying to get his regular season basketball legs under him because he didn't have much Camp as we know as this is the fifth game he's played and he's still working on his conditioning I like the message though he was telling bones Highland and I hope there's young kids out there listening I got to get back to the basics stick The Landing the fun FAL the little things Harden just picked up his first foul with a move here caldwell poke George is on Jokic under six to go in the first half it's pick it on top Leonard is there on the wing three Michael rebound Leonard digging at it with Jokic and Sav by Tucker he's so great with those 50/50 balls it's Leonard the hesitation the spin lost it fouled inside uh by Jaylen picket the rookie how about PJ he's 38 years old PJ Tucker who came in the trade with Harden he isn't all that happy with his minutes he's playing good minutes tonight and this is what he does yeah but they're saving PJ Tucker for the second half of the Season yes he's got to get his rhythm I get all that but DJ Tucker is going to be much more valuable come playoff time for this Clipper team than the these early season games rookie Jaylen picket picked up the foul for the Denver Nuggets 524 to go here in the second Clippers 42% for the four Denver white at 50% 16 of 32 so here's the problem though for the Clippers a lot of standing around a lot of isolation basketball and that's a problem yes cuz they need to keep moving but who you going to ask to move well right there 32 or 33y old Kawhi lonard 32 33y old Paul George Jokic just picked up the foul 38y old Tucker like who's going to move and here are these kids who all grew up in and around the Los Angeles area and all basically in the same age group and probably played against one another H shot there whether they're high schools faced each other I don't know but isn't that amazing in that group in that time frame to have four future Hall of Fame kids all you know right now that same section and all went to different colleges UCLA San Diego State Arizona State I mean this is it's not just a rotisserie team like we've seen other teams try to do this is a team with some thought they needed the passing of Harden Jokic with a three Zubac came out there and Jokic has 14 points and he's knocked in two threes and I've got to throw out Fresno State for Paul George sure Leonard drives on Gordon and pulls up with the mid-range shot it's Michael Galloping the other way Michael on the Fly no knocked Away by George and out of bounds so these high schoolers all close to LA and that Riverside looks a little it do King High School Martin Luther King High School there for Kawhi Leonard tyo said of Harden as he's brought to this team he is exactly what we need we need his passing he creates for others and he gave some outlandish statistic missed three right there by Jackson Zubac has it he said if he took the combined setup by Leonard and George for others to create points and shots it was like in the 50 range total combined and Harden was like over 350 with Philadelphia Leonard drives the bump into P rebound Jokic Jackson down the side Harden is there sneaking in Jackson puts it up with a pretty play biggest lead for Denver it's a luxury to have a Reggie Jackson come off the bench and assert him into the starting lineup in place of Jamal Murray guy with so much game time experience and getting in the way was Caldwell Pope hit somebody's foot Jackson here operating in close quarters mhm nuggets comeing 8 and2 unbeaten at home 6 and0 Clippers come in three and six 0 and five on the road and losers of five consecutive games still trying you can just see right they're just a little bit off Harden the fake the drive in the mid-ranger and Jokic right there to gobble it up and gather his seventh rebound on the move he finds Michael with a runner off the Baseline he's been real quiet tonight that's only his first field goal right there coach Lou 10-point lead for Denver 7 nothing Run for the champion nuggets hey Reggie bleach report has a new cool Innovative called initiative called herob ball where they discuss story lines around the league using cool animations like in the Quest for the inaugural NBA cup Clippers are off to a slow start with their new core four while the nuggets are led by the reigning Finals MVP Nikola Jokic I could watch that stuff I love that stuff here comes here comes Leonard on top and about three to play now down to 2 53 in the half another Miss by Leonard who has played about 14 1/2 minutes he's only h two field goals he has three turnovers no rebounds and he's only two of six so he's off to a slow start tonight for LA Clippers have only had one field goal in the last 6 and2 minutes caldwell pope three Harden nice lead pass George got it beautiful pass but he could not finish now it's five on four Jokic here comes Jokic a floater on the Fly and a technical foul on Paul George again having words with the official Natalie SEO felt that there was contact on that Breakaway how about the unselfish play there by Gordon wasn't that nice yes the T free throw here by Caldwell Pope who has not missed a free throw all season 12 of 12 there's George in the T Tron Lou played at Nebraska his college basketball coach the champion with LeBron here's Harden inside then out Mann got it to Powell he was taken to three and he was fouled By Reggie Jackson and this is what PG was talking about the contact on the Miss layup up little push on the back there by Caldwell Pope was that what he was saying well the official was on the other side so she probably didn't see it because she was blocked by Jokic Denver's on a 10- nothing run Jackson picks up his second personal foul and Powell is at the free throw line the nine-year veteran out of UCLA NBA League Pass has more teams more streams and more intensity sign up and watch games live or on demand including select inseason tournament group play games every Tuesday and Friday start your free trial today I like coach Lou here gambling a little bit putting an inserting Norman Powell back on the floor here with those three fouls Jackson inside a contorted shot and a foul Harden pleading his case the foul goes on James and Jackson will be at the free throw line Harden picks up number two fifth game that Harden has played with the Clippers they have not won yet with him his plus minus has been a minus in each game so far that he has played and tonight he's minus 7 now maybe now- eight but again as teron was talking about the the integration of Harden it's a 10 12 maybe who knows how many games to get this thing up to spe 30 Games my friend yes the way they want to play and he says they want to play with a much quicker pace which I still don't understand how they're going to do with those four guys in the starting lineup because who's going to commit to all that movement tell you what though if anybody can figure it out it's teron l yes he can he kind of went through this one then Kyrie Irving LeBron and Kevin Love po drives on Jackson so five quick points Off the Bench again for a pal with those three fouls 10-point gain now gets AED by 13 early lead of four by the Clippers nice drop pass Jackson and it was Jokic with a pinpoint throw timed 169 and six assists here in this first half for Jokic Harden's got it and then a whistle clock 14 seconds kick about the first half of Reggie Jackson Five of eight 14 points three assists George and Jackson good push off and got the space and misses the 20-footer Jokic collects another rebound he's got 10 another double double he's had a double double in every game this season Gordon backing in on Harden approaching him minute to play in the half Michael three no rebound Powell George had the Collision no foul call look at Powell fly in the corner it's aard three Kawhi Leonard knocks down a Trey he's got eight big shot to get this to single digits now they're going to have to step up their defense here Kawhi's got two threes here in the second quarter Jokic and Harden plenty of time with which to work Jokic now doubled by power too easy and he still got it too easy there's no way you can stop him no and they're too small this is the problem and going forward this will always be the problem with Zubac only being the real primary big for the Clippers coming up the American Express Halftime Report with the Hall of Fame forsome of EJ Kenny Chun and sha three George booket nice shot another good stroke and 20 points in the first half for Paul George Who averages 23 a game and with the fire power the Clippers have if if I'm Coach Lou I can go into this halftime only down eight I'll take it Jackson and Powell a difference of about three and a half seconds game clock and shot clock the switch and Kawhi on Jackson pow's on Jokic finding an open Michael three rebound by George two seconds can he launch it in

coming up next we take you to the American Express halftime report on TNT welcome back to Denver the NBA on TNT presented by State Farm Denver's led by 13 Clippers had an early lead of four and here are some of the numbers 51% shooting for Denver they've been perfect from the free throw line and they're holding the Clippers to just 39% from the floor yeah but a plus 16 domination points in the paint by the bigger Denver Nuggets all right we've got Michael Malone the great coach of the Nuggets I'm going to give you three choices here you want to talk about Jackson in his 14 first half points 11 of 11 from the free throw line of your six to seven bench shooting what do you want to what do you want to talk about Coach let's talk about Reggie Jackson Reggie Jackson a long time LA Clipper uh taking the place of Jamal Murray while he's out with injury and Reggie's been fantastic for us running the team playing his game scoring the ball and making all of his teammates better and Coach I'm going to talk about the bench they're six of seven led by Jaylen picket who you said was going to get his first crack off the bench to sub for Reggie Jackson yeah I think Jaylen for the first time playing real minutes did an outstanding job played with boys uh shot the ball with confidence found the open man and he used his strength and physicality on the defensive end rge to help us get some stops so really impressed by the young fell coming in and helping us have a great first half Michael we always appreciate your time thank you so much thank you guys Michael Malone just signed that gigantic new contract is the coach of the Denver Nuggets as Kawhi takes it across the lane in a whistle and a foul it was called I think on Michael inside it was and Michael picks up his his first with Leonard at the line his first three to 5 minutes for the Clippers critical right cuz right now you've got it down to eight with Kawhi headed to the free throw line in those third quarters they've come out real slow since the Harden train this is a chance for them you're on the road against the world Champs you haven't played well you haven't won a road game yet and this is a chance for you to kind of get back in this ball game kawh Leonard has not miss miss a game yet last time that happened the start of season was 2016 so it's good that he has been durable George looks terrific spry and healthy hardened bit in his legs and his conditioning and you can see at times how this thing really can give them a positive feel Jokic is cutting on the feed from Jackson and what it a goal what a block there by Zub amazing now did he have contact Z did y yep hand on his shoulder good call there by the official oh that's really close to being a goal 10 Jokic the two-time nvp Denver has not missed a free throw all night and they continue in that way 12 of 12 two-time MVP and last season he finished number two in back of Joel embiid but he was the finals MVP Denver is not at least coming into tonight one of the better free throw shooting teams next to last in the NBA at 71% tonight A pristine 13- 13 Westbrook to the rack knocked away it's Gordon on the run the trailing Michael into Kawhi around Harden knocked Away by Zubac with a foul and the nuggets continued to attack that pain area we told you a plus 16 Advantage at the half m not settling for the three puts his head down and

corals it shot clock is new he goes into caldwell pop and he finds Zubac who flushes off the other Baseline Westbrook and Harden on the floor at the same time what do you think of that well to me it's going to make Westbrook a shooter right so his man is always going to be in the lap of James Harden on drives and Paul George so that's why he's trying to be aggressive offensively Russell Westbrook with only two of eight tonight from the field Russ just picked up his first foul many interesting numbers as you take a look here at the numbers before look at the points before the trade 20 down to 108 tonight right now we're sitting at 55 Jokic T from the wing Westbrook got up there foiled the shot Leonard Westbrook Zubac acket of Defenders and he tries to get it up and it finally goes down and Zubac has got seven and the Clippers hanging around they are Gordon oneon-one Larder just pickpockets him and gets another steal the claw comes up with it that's the last person you want to go oneone with George into Caldwell pop away and Caldwell pop with his own great defensive moves coming up with it caldwell Pope number six in Steels a year ago in the corner three quter what a welcome sight he talked about the struggles by Michael Jr gets his first three to go on the evening Five Points now they're going to need his offense his 28 threes lead the Nuggets three minutes gone here in the third quarter Zubac Harden Corner Kawhi on the move it's a Michael rebound Denver is not one here rather the Clippers and not one Denver they have not one in Denver the Clippers since December of 2020 they've lost nine of 10 here over a longer stretch Zubac tried to go in and Hammer it oh he sure did let me alter that statistic on the Nuggets they've won nine of the last 10 overall against the Clippers that includes games in La as the foul goes on Gordon for the first time but here the Clippers have not won since December of 2020 timeout taken by the nuggets with eight and a half to go in the third and congratulations I appreciate that on everything you got to go Gordon you got to go Gordon hey dud that last window though scream cuz you ain't really scream now he fake coralin now y don't got to be up if you scream now PE can turn now it's going to be more space you know what I'm saying hey hey let's close out man we got 215 let's go I'm going up I didn't have you in your upward yet when I'm going up look at out time tell me what you think he wants her to go look at T that shot that's a score right there that is a score right there I'm going up sounds like you I'm jacking and then you have said by the way don't look at my feet when I go up on a shot here's cell po off to Gordon yage on top he's got 20 points with the Miss three it's Leonard the rebound that's the first rebound for Kawhi into Zubac com is Westbrook who goes high and comes down hard it's a four-point game in Denver well look we Marvel about Jokic in his passing Zu watch at that high post area very nice very much the same not the same as Jokic but he can deliver oh rcking inside Westbrook in there trying to deflect it and he did and then this just before it's a 35-year-old high flyer it's Michael with a two foot is on the line knocks in the long shot he's got eight I think they called it a two-point shot yeah did they yep but look if you're James Harden you couldn't have played that any better I mean you were step for step with Michael Jr Leonard trying to surgically cut his way inside Gordon was there defended now they got called well P watching George Jackson is on harden a 37 to Fire and he got it to go Harden puts it up and in Harden has got 14 points with a sweet tray there we got a one possession game here my friend NOA on top Jokic hands off to Caldwell Pope shot clock down to eight Zubac defends will they double the gentle hook will not go there was a foul inside on the Clippers Nuggets patiently trying to work their way Zubac I think may have picked it right up no they give it to Paul George Chris Haynes he picks up his second what do you have well James Harden you saw that connection he has with Zubac in the pick and roll formation I was told that after shoot arounds James has pull Zubac to the side to work out on some of those pick and rolls and so they're they're trying to gather a connection you have to remember this Clippers team they lack bigs Mason plumbley is out for an extended time so Zub box is the only guy that can really roll and that's what James Harton you know thrives in doing the pick and roll formation so you go to see that connection continue to grow zon just picked up his third interesting observation by Chris and how they're trying to work I mean they're learning on the Fly here what each other likes and how they like to maneuver and once py comes back I think he's going to be out about two months this a guy who has great hands and can finish at The Rim high flyer in in Mason plumbley so he'll have options once plumbley comes back plumbley is out with the left MCL sprain they have changed the quarter shot to a three they looked at it in the replay Center and saw that he indeed was although on the floor it was ruled a two with Jokic at the free throw line only person who's missed free throws tonight has been Michael Jr 0 of2 Jokic is 7 to s from the line 75% for the season and that'll rattle in 22 and 11 now four assist away from another triple double for Jokic Harden has played 23 minutes got the Zubac scen here they go he'll take it himself and Scoops it up it's a rebound pulled in by newly instated Jaylen picket rookie out of Penn State saw early time and Michael throws it away the Jamal Murray injury a strained right hamstring was about 10 days ago likely out until sometime mid December maybe they're not going to mess around with it a off tissue issue like that they very careful especially the kid like him he's a vital for this team out to harden over to George finds a crack slithers inside it's zubac with the offensive rebound halfway through the third six-point game George kicks it Westbrook drives it oh almost had it Zubac grabs it doubled out Westbrook three and it will not go rebound clean the glass Jokic races the other way pick it Michael step back Westbrook was feisty with this defense Baseline Drive as pick it gives to Jokic who misses inside Jokic is six of 18 tonight give a lot of credit to Zubac he's making them work Leonard doubled as he took it in the corner George from Westbrook Russell have it shot clock is at eight picked up by Michael now here is Harden bumping into Caldwell pop and a foul called on contavious Caldwell Pope and that's what James Harden will bring to this team you know shot clock running down you can just throw it to him and he can create he can create offense for himself well and he just gives these these little moves and bumps and and Murray says oh come on like I never get that call I never get that call good shot by our director Matt lip our producer tonight is Jeff Randolph for staus sttion Brian Taylor and our great TNT crew crosscourt Powell three nice Norman Powell trains the Tre and he's got nine in the game and it's a three-point game Michael and Powell Jokic and zubac bumping powing my goodness wow he was Maul Down Low by Zubac yeah here's the problem now because now the Clippers are going to have to go small and we saw in the first half the Nuggets take advantage those points in the paint that he clearly had the back of his jersey can the Clippers wait for two months for plom to come back or they go out and get another big some well they're getting ready to come in with Terance Mann yeah it'll go small and man they are athletic when Mann comes in but they're small yes very small Jokic is perfect from the free throw line tonight 23 points let's take a look at our fanuel live Point totals for tonight's game as Jokic is nine of nine from the stripe we began at minus 4 and A2 and that's where we are right now as Zubac will take a seat on the bench and Jokic it's yet another free throw he's got six assists chrisan Brown is checked in for Denver JY Jokic there's a three by Harden rebound by Jokic so it's Gordon and Jokic Caldwell Pope long with Jaylen picket Christian braun young players on the flo for the defending Champion nuggets good steel defense Mann will go the other way cutting and angling in three George C another three and a two-point deficit for LA and that three-point ball is keeping them in this ball game c Us in help quickly Jokic double Christian braun is open Jokic with a great feed well at seven feet he can see over the double team he can see over Pike's Peak Here Comes harden off the man George has called R Pop on him good screen by Mann Powell tries to get free on the Baseline it's picked up by Gordon got numbers he'll scoop it off Caldwell Pope to Gordon Harden closes cutting Gordon with a big time flush the nuggets have answers Aaron gor doing a little bit of everything out here a little give and go action and how about the Finish there by flash they've led by 13 Denver shooting right at 50% the Clippers are shooting 38% PJ Tucker is checked in Harden will pick up the ball here with Mann in one corner Powell in the other and Leonard with the ball with a fake on Gordon and a feed and it's caught by Tucker for three where he is is deadly in that corner along with his defense and hustle that corner three is what keeping him in the in the NBA here is picket man is on travel good defense by Mann and the rookie pick it Terance Mann will just ball Hawking Jaylen pick it there for him into that that turnover look at that yep Shuffle defeat LA Clippers plus six points off turnovers in this game working into two Defenders nothing there for Leonard so he kicks it around now he's got it again and Gordon is there and Jokic is waiting but he got it to go pretty shot in a lot of traffic and 11 for Kawhi and a 0 run since that timeout by Coach Lou here Jokic brings it up like a g feeds Payton Watson Off the Bench into the circle defended by Harden Jokic cleans it up and it's slammed inside Payton Watson eight assists now two away from another triple double for y Harden with it he has 14 Tucker is at the three pows off the bench works his way snaking down low got Jokic and then in the corner Tucker three out of bounds he stepped out of bounds DJ Tucker who is drafted by Toronto played there a year then went overseas for five years comes back to the NBA joined Phoenix initially he's been with some good teams on a championship with Milwaukee and everywhere he's gone he's in the words of the coaches that have had have been indispensable one of those blue guys right here is picket with a Miss shot Nnaji is in as Jokic is resting Nnaji just came in the game and he was good defensively in the first half when he came off the bench well their bench has been great mhm Mann just picked up his second personal foul talk with Michael Malone before the game you know his dad passed during training camp and he missed all of training camp as the world champions were gathering back together and he said you know I I think of my dad a lot cuz he was a coach in the NBA for so many years and and the one piece of advice he gave me that I use a lot and use even more now is when there are challenges he said be with your players don't don't sit in the front of the plane or the front of the go back and be with them talk to them individually and he's really delved into that whole philosophy of connecting with him as people not that he hadn't before but it's even more I think of a priority as you defend a championship especially with the younger players like a pton wson Christian braun Jaylen pigot those kind of guys he knows what he's going to get from the Jamal Mor and the yage of the world inside Leonard again more traffic in that paint it's picked up by Nnaji Gordon the other way the stutter step in the feed and brown was cutting and the ball sails out of bounds another unforced turnover there by the Nuggets nuggets were fearful of this game weren't they with the team that had not won five game losing streak with all this Talent they they thought uhoh this is going to be a challenge tonight hey four future Hall of Famers eventually they're going to get it right pal with a good move to S step for defense and pal double figures now with 11 and he's coming off a 20-point game on Sunday he's just warming up because he's really their fourth quarter performer for the Clippers it's jayen picket and the ball poked out of bounds Jaylen picket is from Rochester New York and he eventually went to Sienna where he was the player of the year in the conference he went to Penn State for the final two years First Team all big 10 he was drafted number 32 by Indiana ends up here with the rights coming to Denver Watson makes a move across the lane powers on him shot clock at one and brown can't get it to go as he would have beaten the clock had it fallen in chance to tie or take the lead with a three here for the Clippers Harden na defending driving and there it is a drive by James Harden to tie it at 79 16 with the eighth tie of the game and this takes so much pressure off kawh Leonard to be the primary score for this Clippers team pick it hesitating and then working his way down and knocked Away by Leonard and picked up by Mann now a chance for the lead they've L earlier by four but it's been a while four steals for Kawhi Leonard tonight Denver a foul to give Hardon faking left right he goes into the lane and oh and there's a bump by Brown and down goes Harden picket was already on the floor and picket picked it up he got the foul the rookie his second yep contact right there on the drive James Harden heading to the free throw line hope points 177 and 18 Harden has not missed a free throw all season two or two tonight this is the first Clipper lead since the first quarter when they were up 2321 the stars and stripes are back to defend their Nations league title watch the US Men's National Team Battle Trinidad and Tobago Thursday starting at Eastern that's on TNT and streaming on Max Harden best game he's played as a Clipper perhaps right well as a team this is the best they've played in other games even that win 113 Clipper run here against the Grizzlies on Sunday they just seemed out of source they are playing much better and more cohesive here Reggie Jackson on the wing is there ni the screen switch on defense Tucker is there shot clock at six dancing driving Jackson whoa Falls in to tie it at 81 Jackson with 16 his first two points of the second half final 9 seconds Harden three over BR good what did you say go back to the basics follow through basics get my feet set Gordon good if it goes got it got it got it to tie it at 84 what a finish the Clippers out score the champion nuggets 3224 Gordon got it off in time to split the double team there yes he did Gordon with 11 Jokic Jaz 24 23 from George the NBA on TNT presented by State Farm a famously smooth whiskey from a famously big family M Jose could be one of us even when he shows up uninvited he's never empty-handed you see he's nearly as smooth as our whiskey must be a Jameson yes it's been a work in progress but all pa George James Harden we talked about the two Southern California Prime Time High School performers they deliver tonight 44 points combined how about this seven of 14 from Deep between the two James Harden is resting on the Clipper bench after a 10-point third quarter and 21 for the game so that in the lineups there's Jackson na up top Tucker got in the way Jackson retries on top for Michael Paul defends the three rebound Westbrook out there with Tucker and Mann and Powell and Paul George it's small but athletic for the Clippers who have fought back from a 13-point deficit Westbrook stopping starting George fakes a three moves inside kicks it in the corner Tucker three got it again he's hit a couple threes from the corner and give him six from the opposite corner yeah he is the corner killer here's Brown driving on Pal set speed for brown as he just goes sprinting for two and he's got eight who's going to win small ball here George inside in brown he gets it to go forcing the issue he's got 25 and with this unit it's got to be Paul George and Norman Powell for the Clippers holiday in for the first time just holiday yep first time he touched the ball right there with Nnaji for brown what a fee for Holiday nice a guy with championship experience in Holiday Off the Bench here for the Nuggets he's only playing in his fourth game of the season and this is game 11 George and the 11year veteran Justin holiday is there the last name should tip you off to the great family of NBA players but they have oh a big collision with Tucker and holiday two veterans and that's a foul with our fourth quarter clock at you could feel the Collision here Nnaji picks up a foul away from the ball look at this Tucker fortunate he didn't pick up that offensive foul right there all right they take out holiday they bring back in Caldwell Pope Clippers outscored the nuggets in the third by eight Westbrook will survey six points for him and it is indeed oh no they're going to call that on Reggie Jackson how about Paul George got away with the hook it goes on Jackson for the third time let's watch it again watch them battling down here I think the crowd saw what you saw Westbrook George was diving Michael Jun with the hold on PG-13 he's got two and this is good for Coach Lou how aggressive the Clippers have been to start this fourth quarter trying to get to the bonus early there there's the hold right there three quick fouls on Denver wook man whistle foul offensive on the Clippers Westbrook was jetting inside Christian braun very turnover for Westbrook here Westbrook's got two Reggie Jackson Michael Jr these two guys to do something offensively here with Jokic on the bench it's a turnover by this group and Terren Mann comes up with it the hesitation the drive shifting gears and Tucker in the corner for three Brown tried to get the rebound look at the hustle there yep and he were fighting for the ball look at the hustle there by Christian braun Westbrook picks up a foul I think yep I like the Hustle by both these players here I mean who wants it more just battling third on Russell Westbrook there's Jackson bumping in Dem man but nothing called and springing back up Reggie Jackson Christian braun Nnaji o inad shot but he's got the protected goggles on so he says Let's Straighten those babies out and here we go shot clock at four and a long two inside Westbrook grabs the loose ball you got to get yogas back in the ball Westbrook has seven rebounds George with quarter defending three minutes gone here in the fourth George three it misses it all with an air ball caught by Michael Jackson pushing the pace bodies again on the FL the other end getting up is niji brown working on Powell Caldwell Pope a move a spin a lean and a whistle well there is a big difference when Jokic is in and out in the plus minus taking a look at the upcoming National TV schedule tomorrow on ESPN the Celtics will be in Philadelphia felia and the Kings will be in La against the Lakers Friday on ESPN in seon tournament continues with the kings in Texas against the Spurs and the Suns in Utah against the Jazz and for more on these games go to nba.com visit the NBA app Jokic is in yeah but Jokic is in the Zubac still on the bench here with those four fouls now what's been successful for the Clippers has been this smaller unit so this is something coach Li is going to have to coach L is going to have to monitor this smaller unit with Jokic on the floor here for Denver another tie number 12 and Leonard and George and called well pop will defend shot clock at five Paul George what a shot he's got 27 points yage has 24 and Tucker's just going to try to body him quarter with a three Tucker with a rebound and four minutes gone in the fourth here's Westbrook six rebounds and a couple of assists with the whistle foul on Brown ride the hot hand look at the footwork and the fade away here by George so Christian braun just picked up his third Michael will check out G back on the floor here now for the nuggets2 Paul George double man feed strook this is why I love Terance Mann being on the floor in crunch time minutes he just makes all the right place Clippers have their biggest lead trying to stop a five-game losing streak and look for for the first win with Harden Gordon thinking three man stuck with him good move Gordon with a finger roll and a sweet sweet dance inside how about that Euro Step there by Gordon they have some stops in them cuz right now Paul George is just making it happen being the deao point guard right to the rack with a great looking layup in 29 he's got four threes and 29 game high called well poped tries to angle in George knocked it away foul called with a penetrating move under seven to go in the fourth here's that Euro Step by Aaron Gordon but even better has been Paul George 29 Points though he did just pick up his fourth foul here Denver and this is the way Group B in the west looks already Denver is won Clippers are looking for their first win win it all ends up in Las Vegas in the first handful of days I believe Dallas lost tonight to the pelicin the PD is the point differential and that comes into play with ties at the free throwers yeah at the free throw line is caldwell Pope the foul went on George who picks up his fourth Denver went up they were up by two and they went from that point to down by four while Jokic was out Jokic is in now with Gordon and caldwell Pope and brown and Michael here's Westbrook with George and Leonard and Tucker and Mann Russell Westbrook Paul George with 29 and now 31 defended by Caldwell Pope there's nothing that Caldwell Pope can do he's outed him but that jab step was freezing him at the defensive end big lead for the Clippers tonight who have not won in Denver since 2020 December of 2020 Jokic Caldwell Pope Nikola takes it and that's a foul look at that look at that and who made the play PJ Tucker second on Nikola Jokic and if you look at the numbers though by Jokic his points decrease fourth quarter right he usually gets off to good starts in the first and second quarter but for whatever reason his scoring declines in the fourth nuggets are unbeaten at home so far 6 and0 Jokic in this half is 0 of four from the field Leonard works on the seconde player brown with a series of moves fak dips shoot scores H Kawhi 13 remember they're doing all this with James Harden on the bench Brown flight one can land pretty pass and a great finish let's see if the Nuggets though can come up with any stops here Westbrook and Christian braun shot clock in single digits as Tucker gives to kawwai Gordon is there three it's missed by Leonard it's up by Caldwell pop Michael was trailing on the play and they'll set their offense Christian braun with the whistle PJ Tucker was down there how about the alley here by Brown in the oop by Michael Jr left hand finish Tucker just picked up his first personal foul Harden is coming back in brown leaves for the nuggets and Harden in for West Westbrook now does that mean they trust Harden late in games like this more than Russ well I mean a guy that averaged 11 assists just a year ago and he's having a really good game offensively with those 21 points best's look that's the team is look since Harden has joined him Jackson with kawi Leonard on him shot clock at four look how much he forced him to the three-point line Tucker pushes and Y shoots and rattles out that close rebound oh they're fighting for with Mann and Gordon Mann hand to hand combat how did that ball come out by Jokic did you see that it was it was in shot clock running down a desperation onelegged fade away three touched every inch of that rim and came out they called the jump ball between Mann and Gordon and here you see them ready for the toss nuggets have it y on top Tucker on him Caldwell Pope shot clock at five here comes Jokic he spins on George and gets it to go on the doorstep because they had to run a high screen en roll to get PJ Tucker off of Jokic Paul George was guarding him Michel Malone goes back to that Harden with 21 and four assist George long two no rebound Mann now Tucker Clippers control there was deflect that's over and back that's over and back hard is trying to say it was deflected hold on they may overrule it they may change the call I don't know if anyone touched it though yeah no one touched it that should be over and back you sure Michael didn't I think they said Michael just touched it watch watch Michael's they want take a look at that if if they can they can't review it no one touched the basketball oh I is finger look like it was moving re does it yeah it does wow they cleaned it up on the floor George will make a move and call will pop is defending the shot clock is a two he's got a fire way outside no rebound it's clutched onto by the nuggets and Jackson at the controls Reggie Danson you got to get a screen and roll to get Tucker off of Jokic and they do now Mann is on Jokic Tucker will be in back of Mann down goes Mann here comes Jokic and put up an in by Cordon Michael Malone is livid right now with the official it's a one-point game 34 seven to go 6 nothing nugget run number one zubu got into foul trouble so they had to go with small ball in comes PJ Tucker he made a couple of those threes and that's kind of been the difference here now what does Coach Lou do adjustment now with the bigger lineup on the floor with Jokic it's still that smaller unit looks like Tucker is out Terance Mann Norman Powell on the floor here to go along with James Harden Paul George and kawii Leonard George will bring it up his 31 leading all scores in the game Denver has four their five starters and double figures Mann reeling inside Leonard lost the ball on the dribble then fights for and it's out of bounds and it's off of Denver and the shot clock is at 8 boy that was almost a turnover off the foot there of Leonard right into the hands of Reggie Jackson who just couldn't Corral it this game is beginning to hit it stride in the second half and especially in the fourth quarter hey this is a must- win for the Clippers Harden four to fire Jackson on him gets one inside Mann outside Powell free good Norman Powell cans a three he is their fourth quarter score that was a big shot and a four-point lead for the Clippers now here's Jackson Mann will greet him it's Jokic and Leonard takes him low carving his way with a whistle foul on Leonard sending Jokic to the free throw line where he is 10 of 10 tonight what a big play by Norman Powell knocked down that corner three but again under size and Zubac after that fourth foul has not re-entered the game here double double for Jokic 26 and 13 and 11 of 11 from the free throw line overall the Nuggets tonight shooting 51% from the floor their offensive rating is number five their defensive rating is number six the nuggets and if you're wondering why the Harden tradeit it's for situations like this to play alongside Paul George and qu lonard Harden got the screen weaves his way shot clock with Jokic on him is at nine Harden and Jokic double by caldwell Pope the drive by James the tith Inside Out of Bounds it's Denver's ball 244 to go boy he had a step on Jokic and just couldn't finish scoring to his strong end Denver Cony take a lead right here two and a half the play he going to send help all he's going to do is back down and get a foul George defending Jokic is shooting missed it up and down for the tie there's no size there is absolutely and if you're not going to send help he's going to get what he wants the nuggets on a 10 to 3 run Gordon goes out on Harden right now Jackson is defending Leonard shot clock at four triple team Leonard out to George shot clock at one shot clock violation what defense by the Denver Nuggets that is outstanding defense by the Nuggets Reggie Jackson oneon-one no help versus Kawhi Leonard beautiful of moving his feet and as we mentioned Jackson the one taking the place of the injured Jamal Murray and he has not disappointed has it now with Mann onaman back diic who's defended by Paul George here comes to help now you've got Advantage caldwell po inside for the lead Gordon count it foul and that's the problem when you play small if you elect to come double you're going to open it up to a four on three situation beautiful pass by kcp fighting Gordon underneath for the potential and one Norman Powell picked up his fourth personal foul Gordon is at the free throw line with night is two- two with 15 points five rebounds and six assists big night again for Aaron Gordon and plenty of time here for the Clippers no time to panic here V gets r a 13-3 run the last 4 and A2 minutes George three rebound Powell another offensive rebound by the LA Clippers a three foul by Caldwell Pope before the three-point shot sending Paul George to the free throw line for two not three before he was aiming and shooting looks like they're bringing back PJ Tucker Tucker yeah going to come back in with George at the free throw line and the foul it's on caldwell pop for the third time and at the free throw line is Paul George where he is three of three and you assume that Tucker is going to come in and and body The Joker down low so if you're the nuggets and and Michael Malone you got to rub that rub screen just a simple side screen to get Tucker off of Jokic because Tucker has bothered Nia down low bman B checks out with 14 points on seven shots just a rub screen Tucker is out there the Clippers are small and Jackson D everyone was anticipating that down screen for Jokic and Reggie Jackson

that can finish plays Paul George James Harden and kawh Leonard now Kawhi hasn't shot the ball particularly well tonight I'm more interested in can they get stops right now down three with the ball if you're the Clippers you know you can get any shot you want but defensively can they stop the nuggets ver trail 9992 with 545 left in the game since that time the Nuggets about scored the Clippers 15 to five 110 to go Norman Powell is back in Tucker is out howwell inbound Leonard's got it and Gordon is on him and Kawhi with a beautiful fade away that's his patented shot it's a rebound by Jokic he's got 15 of them Jackson Mann defends andic dangerous pass Gordon cleans it up Gordon cleaned it up Mann there Gordon George the other way two no loose picked up inside by Jackson tber 17 to5 Reggie Jackson Mann did the holding with 31 seconds to go in this crowd in full throat and again I I know Jokic will get the bulk of the headlines and rightfully so but Aaron Gordon Reggie Jackson down the stretch here this is championship basketball and what they experienced just a year ago during the finals going 16 and3 on their run to winning the first championship in franchise history these guys have all grown Leaps and Bounds because of that experience 18 for Jackson and his first Miss from the free throw line 18 points in 11 shots without him here's Jackson against his former team he played over 200 games with the Clippers from 2019 to 23 and came here late last season missed them both Leonard's got it five-point game 30 seconds to go Kawhi quter defends Leonard tries to free himself and does and he misses the jam inside with a shove and a foul on Denver away Michael has got his third foul clock at 22 seconds oh it was the push in the back by Michael Jr it wasn't Jokic they want to challenge I think I think they're going to challenge yeah but from that angle it looked like there was a push in the back there by Michael Jr a challenge by Michael Malone with a fivepoint lead in 22 seconds to go with the NBA on T and team all stands it is a foul and Michael picks it up so unsuccessful challenge here by Michael the hand in the back by Michael Jr affects Len's ability to finish at the rim and the challenge is unsuccessful there'll be two free throws for ler Denver no longer has a timeout and they've lost this challenge the ability to challenge the rest of the game that's our crew chief Josh Chen in his 14th season in the NBA Leonard at the line where he is one of two with his points on 14 shots in 38 minutes Clippers have not won a game on the road this season 0 and five and the nuggets have not lost a game at home all season in the very short number of weeks we've been underway they are six and0 full court pressure it's Jackson Jokic called well Steel by Leonard picked up by George in the paint to the rack and he got it to go it is a one-point game with 15.3 Denver uses the timeout and kawh Leonard Steel by Leonard with his fifth steal of the evening right here that creates the Paul George opportunity to close this deficit to one in this league you are never out of out of it you are never ever beauty of this league in this game let's go six man and moments ago Caldwell p as he's walking to the Huddle look like he may have been cramping in that right calf area he's in Gordon will inbound Denver holding on to a one-point lead Jokic doubled sandwiched fouled Powell his Fifth and two seconds off the clock we're down to 13 in regulation a 12 of 12 perfect night at the stripe for Jokic 30 points 16 rebounds on 23 shots in 35 minutes don't forget the nine assists the other number I want to bring up there Here Comes Zubac he'll take the place of Powell and you mention it Kawhi Leonard five steals tonight and a big one moments ago Clippers have a timeout Denver's out and La takes the timeout down by three with the ball and 13 seconds to go well number one if I'm coach Lou you got to get Norman Powell back on the floor here for the Clippers I assume Zubac will come back out and remember James Harden Kawhi Leonard Paul George all three of those guys can create their own shot from behind the ark and then you add their ability to drive and Dish and collapse the defense they can find a Norman Powell who just moments ago made a big three in the corner here J so if you're the Nuggets do you elect to foul here play the free throw game play the odds there are the threep point shooting leaders tonight for the Clippers Michael Malone had a premonition before the game this is what they would face tonight about man they've lost five in a row they have not won a game on the road yet we don't lose that home I jump on them we know we're getting a desperate team jump on there win the first quarter together 1 2 3 great job by our folks in the truck going back to what was the theme tonight Harden will inbound he's got Zubac he's got kawh Leonard Powell and he's got George 13 seconds left Powell George Caldwell Pope is on him Paul George this could tie it oh W of all times to get it at the worst time to get a wedgie oh oh this will be a jump it is a jump ball by any two on the floor currently well this is not the worst thing for the Clippers it's good to have zubac who was on the floor here at jump ball cuz that was not going to be good can he get it to Norman Powell still a lot of time left and in a scramble situation you never know you never know here it is here we go yoka Janet knocked off the Jackson Hees the ball Zubac tried to get it claimed by Caldwell Pope it's over Denver is survived and one undefeated at home 7 and0 and the Clippers lose their sixth consecutive game and 0 and six on the road playing the defending Champions right down to the end well we saw a championship experience from a lot of guys on the Denver Nuggets but we also saw from the Clipper side a glimpse of the future of what could be once they round everyone into shape and figure out those defining roles over the last half of the fourth quarter the nuggets outscored the Clippers 19 to9 and Win It by three let's send it over to Chris Haynes I'm here with the joker himself Joker that was a hard fought Victory what did it take down there in the stretch to get this guame I mean uh we needed the rebound We we kcp played really good defense a couple couple times in a row uh and uh we executed we we score we we made couple couple couple important baskets and uh at the end we won a tip can you take me through your mindset when the Clippers they're not playing with a lot of bigs they're throwing a lot of smaller guys at you what's your mindset in those type of matchups I think that's Advantage for us you know you know if they're going to send a double if they're going to just play start up I think that's Advantage right away so uh I think we did a good job today um I miss I to be honest I miss a couple open looks and a couple easy easy easy hooks but that's that's it's okay as long as we got a win we can definitely tell the intensity is up is ratcheted up in season tournament what what what has it been like for you thus far yes I mean they they lost five in a row uh we know they're going to play really aggressive they didn't quit they fought uh but we we we are undefeated undefeated at home so and we wanted to keep like that zoker congratulations brother thank you thank you have 32
