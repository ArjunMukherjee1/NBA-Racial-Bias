 evening the Net's Hometown starting lineup starters are also brought to you by Medical Mutual the six1 Ben Simmons says this is the healthiest he has felt in over two years he will open the season as the net starting a point guard while Mikal Bridges had a breakout season offensively here in Brooklyn after being acquired Midway through last season 48-year-old jacqu vaugh took over for Steve Nash in November last season now his Club looks dramatically different than the one he inherited last season the Nets traded both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant in February but AC make no mistake this team still features a lot of talent they have designs on being a factor in the East this season yes they do I mean when you look at how they have uh constructed now they can put the ball in the basket they like to get up and down the floor they're going to be everywhere around the Cavs have to have good transition defense the problem with the Nets is the other end of the floor that's where the Cavs have to have patience and they have to shoot the ball well to take advantage of the Net's deficiency on defense one of the biggest priorities in the off seon bring in outside shooting open up the floor for those Speedy guards in Garland and in Donovan Mitchell and this man can certainly do that Max Strus who made a run to the NBA finals last season makes his first start in wi and gold George Niang will come off the bench but the Cavaliers both are long range threats there's a look at George who spent the last few seasons in Philadelphia always talking he'll be active out there on the floor so the cows have made their offseason adjustments in the Personnel Department it's been six long months of preparation to gear up for tonight and Beyond as we are underway with Austin Carr and Sereno John Michael thanks for inviting us into your homes here tonight as with the basketball as Nic Claxton Claxton finds Simmons Simmons can do this he'll post you up from that point guard spot as Johnson works it off to Simmons Simmons looks to go Baseline on Strus flicks one up and he air mails the first shot of the Season it was nice defense that time by stre he stayed you had to make him shoot over the top benel weaves in on Johnson and knocks it down and when you look at how he set that shot up he was getting ready to go to his left he backed up he knocked it down off to a good start Don I mean Donovan Z as we'll find dwy dwy cans the corner three this is his second Tour of Duty here in Brooklyn 10year man out of Colorado go ahead AC and that's what he will do you have to stay up on him cuz he will shoot that ball from anywhere garland cruises to the basket he lays it in you don't want to get caught up in their style because they're not going to defend like the Cavs defend so you have to find a way to play your style but take advantage of it Clon tests his range the Cavs will live with that shot as JV waves his arms as move it the Cavs oblig Garland to a Coro extra pass back to Strus Strus's first shot as the Cavalier is just long Garland keeps it alive he pokes it toward Mitchell Mitchell Falls onto the table right in front of us he's all right back in the play as the Cavs make a hustle play less than 90 seconds in Mitchell on corks at three Simmons rebounds oo that was action you right there yeah action the first first quarter we get action right away I love it blacking with the offensive rebound off he did what he miss he got stripped Mitchell and the Cavs have numbers Strus fires got it yes in transition they've been working on that in training camp coming down taking advantage of the first opportunity that they received JB has said he wants this team to play more quickly this season we'll see how that transpires the has played at the slowest Pace statistically in the League last year here's Mikal Bridges going to work as we have a foul called Okoro was trying to fight over a Claxton screen and just moments ago Donovan Mitchell came flying right at us yes he did full speed too keep an ey on it and here's his play on the defensive end as Mitchell runs the break finds the trailer Strus does the rest and that's the way you draw it up as we're back to action Mitchell gets his hand on another ball and knocks it out of bounds he was active on the defensive end last season Mitchell finished top 20 in the league in steals per game he was also number one and loose balls recovered was Mitchell and rout to being named all NBA second team as Bridges lob to the rim Paxton's there to me Mitchell was superb last season starting off this way getting the ball to other men kind of set them up because he's already established game is garet again with that little floater in the middle the Cavs here early have been able to penetrate with ease as a skip pass and tenifer Simmons is Too Tall and over his head it goes and I like what the Cavs are doing they still have the defensive intensity they're going to have to rebound as a team though until Allen gets back so everybody has to have respons defensive rebounding responsibilities you can put whatever stock you'd like into pre-season numbers but boy the Nets were extremely turnover prone in ex I play as here's Mitchell over the timeline he'll orchestrate this offensive sequence by dealing to Garland the Cavs now play through mole and that's why it's so important defensively to be on top of this team Mobley repos twist hangs in the air and he gets the roll as Evan Mobley gives the Cavaliers a 125 lead yeah nice soft release he's does that a lot now he's really coming back with a lot of confidence in that middle game Johnson looking to get loose finds Den witty Bridges comes and gets it Bridges goes Baseline ran out of real estate dumps off to Clon Clon inside clears himself missed the bunny can he get it back not quite but he tips it to a teammate in Bridges bridges backs up missed the three Simmons poked at it loose ball eventually picked up by Strus Strus gallops into the four Court finds Okoro Okoro through DWI puts it up and in and Isaac Okoro has a chance for the three-point play Strus initiated the whole action he got out on the Breck real quick quick like they're trying to do get it up the floor quickly take advantage of what they give you on the other end there you see Strus doing a good job of keeping his head up uro bullying to the basket opportunity for a three-point play all five Cavaliers have scored less than four minutes in Cavs 14 Nets five that's a good sign because everybody's in contributing offensively Simmons to the basket he missed the shot Mitch he has his head out Euro Step Down The Late hole with a brilliant move by Donovan Mitchell and jock V wants an early time out well if you don't focus on defense which the Nets don't the Cavs are going to take advantage of it I like to see the early start like this the Cavaliers have gotten out of the gates quickly Mitchell to the basket 165 Cavaliers welcome back to Cavaliers basketball I am Serena winter there are some guys in this league that when they are guarding you you know what is going to be a tough night that guy for the Cavaliers is Isaac Okoro and maxre told me that when he was on the other side he did not want to have him guarding him yeah no question miss him um I dreaded played against him and him having to guard me um just the his physical presence and his ability to guard the ball and and guard guys um on actions and everything like that I just never wanted him to guard me so very happy that I'm on his team and and happy to have him alongside of me Bridges with a drifting jumper as we are back underway 167 is the Cavalier lead with a player like like Bridges you don't really you don't stop him you just kind of irritate him and that's what you have to do to throw him off a little bit Okoro forced him into a tough shot as we have a foul caught on Bridges that's a coro's job tonight just shut Bridges water off that's your basically your not just one of your jobs pretty much your primary jobs we take a look at our injury report brought to you by elen out Jarrett Allen remains out and Dean Wade is out tonight with an illness Allen missed the last couple of weeks of camp with a bone bruise not ready yet to return so Okoro is in that starting lineup strw fires it knocks it down strews with a couple of Threes in this opening quarter good ball movement he can shoot it Thomas is checked in for Brooklyn as Johnson to the basket Evan Mobley was there Garland looking for Strus back to Okoro Okoro puts it on the floor he got stripped from behind by Johnson Johnson out and running he lays it in you got a they got a little hands that time but no call Cavaliers 19 Nets nine he approached the Midway point of the opening quarter and started to say Okoro terms of the game plan as here he is in the corner stop Bridges and you've done your job as CS wouldn't go any there on Clon they won't get it Clon was second in the league and blocks for gain last season Johnson darts one inside of Simmons Bo Simmons passed up a shot right from underneath that three by Thomas is no good and has popped to Strus and that's where Simmons is going to have to take those shots he really hurts the team when he does not take those shots Garland got Simmons on a by it we have a foul called as Garland was trying to find his favorite Target in Mobley at The Rim here's Evan on the defensive end yes always good on the defensive end He is unbelievable on the def defensive end good job of not stand vertical G wanted go tending on that Claxton block that was close yeah that was real close Harris Levert sees his first action he replaces Darius Garland well done by Garland a three from Okoro is good Isaac Okoro Pockets the corner three Cavs are moving the ball very soundly now they're doing a good job of forcing them to make quick decisions the Cavs have hit nine of their first 12 shots they're four of six from long range that corner three is good as Finney-Smith has an answer they can score the ball that's one thing they do well but you have to make them pay on the other end we've already seen all four of the players that the Nets received in return in the Irving and Durant trades as a follow by the Cavs uhoh Donovan Mitchell is slow to get up eventually he's back to his feet and Cavs commit an intentional foul there as Mitchell was working his way back into the defensive end when he hit the floor little bit off balance a little bit oh right on his foot he thought Day'ron Sharpe took away his landing area again that's not a traditional jump shot where you see that kind of a call as Mitchell was drifting in Donovan seems no worse for the wear Isaac Okoro and Max spruz check out well when you're in this kind of shape that Donovan's in and and you and you work out in the weight room and you do what you have to do you can take those type of Falls George Niang and Ty Jerome make their first Cavalier appearance as Simmons at The Rim dunks Simmons is just so long 610 with all that reach free time Allstar select all defense Levert lines up a three Simmons looks to the rim Bridges with a catch tried to finish all in one motion he got fouled by Ty Jerome they're trying to make the Cavs play the full court that's what they're doing and the Cavs are doing a good job of getting back to defend those shots coming back good hustle down the floor make him have to take tough shots so Bridges who put up Superstar likee numbers after the trade from Phoenix he averaged 26 points a game in Brooklyn at the end of last season the 27 contest Bley Sports Ohio is taking over the Cavs box office during tonight's game you can get a ticket to see the Cavs take on the Knicks on Halloween night and Valley Sports Ohio will pick up the cost of a second seat now this offer is valid until midnight this evening visit cavs.com buyout to purchase tickets now Cavs are freely substituting keeping guys fresh because they have they're deep they're much deeper team Bridges split the pair as Mitchell wanders into a 15-footer that's rebounded by Finney-Smith the former Maverick is now at Simmons Simmons over the timeline drops off the Thomas Thomas's elbow jumper is good he last season he came in hot as a firecracker and then all of a sudden he couldn't hit a basket Thomas at a Wild Streak of three straight 40 plus point games for a player who averaged less than 11 points a game all last season it's just a dramatic stretch as once again Mitchell is able to penetrate get to that basket and draw another foul well when you have guys out there that the defense has to respect now what happens is you get these type of situ races where you can split the def Defenders and get inside nice move by Donovan inside got tripped from behind Mitchell already has seven points three rebounds and a pair of assists Mobley wants Jerome and finds him Jerome is checked by tin witty uses a mly screen Jerome to the basket floats and scores as the former Warrior gives the Cavaliers a 267 lead he is so good at that floating shot he used it a lot in the preseason and carrying it over to the season no middle no middle Thomas checked by Jerome gets to the pain and to floated over Mobley missed the shot badly is Mobley was looming in that lane good hands by Donovan to the pride to loose JB has talked about the as Levert fires a three he knocks it down JB talked about the way Evan Mobley affects the game sometimes you don't see it necessarily in the numbers but that was a prime example of what Mobley can do in that paint on the defensive end yes he he's just superb at changing shots changing your direction changing your mind on taking shots Royce O'neale has checked in gives the ball to Thomas Thomas breaks toward the basket Niang got back and Niang will make him earn it what a start for Donovan Mitchell here in this first quarter yeah very solid start on both ends of the floor get another steal and open up the fast break the Cavs get off and Levert doing a super job of knock going down Mitchell gets a well earned rest big man Damen Jones will see his first action as a Cavalier as big number 30 enters Jones is with his seventh team in his eighth season he should see increased time here early with Jarrett Allen out of the lineup yeah I was impressed with him in doing the preseason I mean he did a good job of of being a solid backup player for the Cavaliers because as a backup you have to maintain Ain what the starter has started he did a pretty solid job in the preseason Cavaliers by 10 deny gets called for a foul off the ball as he was trying to stay with Darius Garland and and you can see that this team the coach at the timeout told him hey you guys got to play you got to defend better so all every one of them they're putting hands bodies everything they have to do on the Cavs by the fact that the Cavs are playing without the ball is causing Brooklyn a lot of problems because they are handsy and they don't move their bodies the Nets are over the limit so Garland will shoot free throws he put up virtually identical numbers last season as he did during the 2122 Allstar campaign and really when you think about it AC gracefully was a wonderful compliment to Donovan Mitchell in the back court it was Mitchell of course who got the All-Star on the all NBA team accolades but this man Darius Garland is such a classy team first Focus that his selflessness sometimes can make you forget he's only 23 years of age exactly he's only 23 and believe me every player in this league has a great respect for him cuz he's a bad man Donovan was talking about darius's constant positive energy and that's where a lot of his leadership comes from another alleyoop as this time it's Sharpe who finishes it was D witty with the pass and when you allow him to penetrate get that step like that that opens it up for the Live pass Jerome takes the hand off from Jones we have an illegal screen CAU against the Cavaliers Jones picks up the personal and we have a Timeout on the floor more from Brooklyn after this 21 is the Cavalier lead here's our Taco Bell take well last season Donovan Mitchell hit a career high 245 frees that sh shattered a franchise record he also had his second highest total in terms of dunks with 37 and they see those two things don't always go together high dunk and a threo volume that shows you how bral he is I mean he can do a lot of different things and then that's why he was one of the best guards in the NBA last season as mention named all NBA second team name to another Allstar team as well as meanwhile here's Den witty he's picked up by Darius Garland the Cavalier lead is 10 Thomas in the corner works on Jones goes across the lane double clutches and scores again and this team focuses a lot on one-on-one play so when you get in your on the wings of one of those guys you have to stop him because they're not looking to pass the ball watch by Thomas drives down the lane deals to Jones and Jones does well Thomas Drew raves on the offense ENT that wasn't exactly the case defensively for the young man last season which is why his time was uneven but Caris doing a great job of setting him up and giving him good opportunity to throw the hammer down Thomas works on niang floats it up and we have a foul called here's Carris Levert on the offensive end and that was the move you were talking about a leing off the dribble and keeping your head up when you get past the defender you got to keep your head up to see the opportunities in front of you he makes a great pass that foul on Jones is his second let's pause for a word from your local Kia dealers the number one most Dependable Mass Market brand three years in a row by JD Power John Michael Austin Carr and Serena Winters as Thomas cans both and trims the Cavalier lead to eight and it's good to be back is yes it it feels great man I'm like man let's go and the Cavs are playing solid ball both ends of the floor Niang off to Jones garland comes and gets it garland uses a Jones Screen rebounded by Thomas 90 seconds to go in the first no middle no middle Thomas is picked up by Jones out around the fr he looks to drive Thomas has had a nice opening quter off the Brooklyn bench 10 quick points for the young man yeah he he really can get hot in a minute I mean that young man can put the ball in the basket but it's all one-on-one Play here's Thomas again this time on L Thomas will shoot more free throws yeah he's the one that's bringing him back in the ball game Thomas already is four for four from the line here's the Cavalier turnover on the other end little little too hard on that pass right there from the distance that they were and uh coming down he's off to a good start he's going to be a tough man to handle for the rest of this game there's a look at associate head coach Greg Buckner Buckner's defense was ranked number one in the NBA last season and deservedly so they were awesome Niang rebounds garland Niang Jones Jerome and Levert make up the Cavalier five Thomas has scored the last seven points for the home Club as Garland weaves his way through traffic puts it up that's blocked as drron Sharpe got a piece of it Niang makes sure he's on the right side of the line that's knocked out of bounds it will be Cavalier basketball they're playing a little better in the paint now so Cavs come back with Mobley to kind of counteract what they're doing in the paint Brooklyn does have a number of paint cloggers including Dr Ron Sharpe Nic Claxton's one of the best and here's Sharpe with the SWAT yeah I I think they like Sharpe a little better because he's a little more physical but Claxton he he can run the floor that young man is good he can play the game Claxton was one of the top defenders in the NBA last season Sharpe numbers have been up and down in his young three-year career Ray aosta sorts things out here with Jo vaugh they're going to put nine on the shot clock here as the housekeeping continues now we have it squared away neither head coach appears satisfied no I mean what if the referees this their first game also so they'll get it together in a few minutes Garland puts it on the floor to the basket puts it up and in as Sharpe couldn't get there that time well he did a good job of showing him the ball which froze him for a second and that gave him the opportunity to make the shot Thomas a drifting three oh rather High degree of difficulty as Thomas is redot early he has 14 first quarter points again he's the one that got him back in the game it's going to have to be little more focus on him on the defensive end of the floor there's a 7sec difference between shot clock and game clock Garland goes to work loer Mobley and Mobley throws it down the Cavaliers led the league in dunks last season the Garland de Mobley combination was third in the entire league in assister her to field goals made as and a foul called with 3 seconds remaining that fouls on Mobley they're coming inside nice over the top Mobley doing a good job taking his first step out and then to the basket that makes the defender have to cover a little bit more ground that foul on Mobley is his second as we mentioned Thomas last season raised some eyebrows around the league in February three straight 40-point games he was unbelievable he burst upon the scene in Jag in 2021 led the summer league in scoring was named summer league co-mvp along with Davon Mitchell at the Kings put up the highest average ever by a player in Vegas League who played at least four games wow I mean he can put the ball in the basket now he can score garland from midcourt the first quarter is over solid Road opening 12 for the Cavs particularly on the offensive end yes I thought offensively the Cavs were superb they did exactly it showed what they wanted to do for this season as far as having openings for guys to shoot the ball and their in their Pace was great balance scoring Garland eight Mitchell seven Strus six is on to the second quarter we go we mentioned the balance scoring AC Garland led the way with eight points Mitchell with seven Max Strus cashed in with a couple of Threes in his first quarter as a c Cavalier yeah it's going to take a good defensive quarter though to get this team under control because they again like I said they can score the basketball Kim Thomas came off the bench and scored the last 11 points of the quarter for the Nets the Cavaliers with another three here early in this second quarter gardland is off to a great start I mean very solid effort so far in the game c are six of 10 from behind the line O'neale has an answer four 4 34 Cavaliers Garland Niang lever Strus and Jones are on the floor for the Cavs to start this second as Garland has it poked out of bounds the ball stays with the Cavs you can tell by the effort that they have been they have been uh asked to play Stronger defense because they have much more their effort is much stronger now garland doing a good job of using the little pick come right off that pick and knock it down the veteran Dennis Smith has check backed in for the Nets as we have an offensive foul on the Cavs it's on Jones for another illegal screen the indication made by referee Ray aosta as that Jones stuck his knee out as he picks up his third yeah they're really calling that I mean that that that I mean he had to put his knee there he had to put his leg there to set the stream but hey that the cats had to play through those type of situations Ray is joined by umpire fenesy Ransom in his six season and the 26-year veteran Mark Davis he's the crew chief tonight as Royce O'neale missfires on a three the Nets Keep The Possession alive dwit thought about it deals with the corner Smith they really look for those threes that's how they get him back in the game in scramble plays where they get guys into those open positions you know the three-point shot was such a huge part of the Nets Arsenal last season however a lot of their longdistance Weaponry is now gone as Garland fires a 15-footer Darius Garland continues his assault here in this first half very efficient shooting tonight Bridges nearly walked Cru closes out on him Bridges inside got bumped and fouled and bridges will shoot two you know this team feature the likes of Joe Harris Utah wat anavi Seth Curry and Patty Mills all of whom shot threes at over 40% last season all of since departed and that doesn't count Irving and Durant who were traded away midseason as Strus did not like like that call and there you get a look why yeah you're right that that was not much there if any the Cavs return home and will take on the Oklahoma City Thunder home opener Friday tip time all fans will get a vintage t-shirt presented by our friends at Cleveland Clinic visit cavs.com tickets you want to talk about durability mhm Bridges was drafted back in 2018 he has not missed a single game in his entire career the current NBA Iron Man tonight is numbered 393 in a row yeah for somebody that's kind of lightly built he is really strong in certain areas and really being available he's unbelievable with that Mobley doing a good job of crossing over one leg jumping good tough shot against his body over the outstretched arm of Claxton 4439 Cavaliers opening minute second quarter brid pestered by Niang get some help from Mobley on the switch Bridges looks to penetrate gets there missed the shot however Mobley picks it up he'll work it to the four Court finds Garland Garland underneath that pass is picked off lever's the lone man back Smith back to d w ball ends up out of bounds C's doing a good job I think defending in the transition they're doing a solid job of at least getting back and attempting to defend Clon straight away and now we have an illegal screen on Brooklyn seen a number of these calls here in this first half I think the referees like that call point of EMP a couple of seasons ago those moving screens and that has continued do says he got held as lever and bridges looked to separate it wasn't an illegal screen it was Bridges and Levert in a shoving match so here is Levert Levert steps into a three out comes O'neale long time teammate of Donovan Mitchells for five seasons in Utah Smith carts into the basket stops in the paint O'Neal's open only rebounds perfect rebound when the ball hits the floor between your men and and you get the ball that's good blocking out everything thing is solid on that defensive effort Niang can't find the range did with he took a b from Strus let's see if he gets continuation here by the looks of Mark Davis it is going to be a shooting foul and indeed it is see that's why the cows had a problem with that on that kind of a play the shooters Head and Shoulders must be moving in an upward Direction prior to the foul for it to be a shooting foul and boy it appeared that Strus Scott this man den witty before those Head and Shoulders headed to the rafters right well sometimes you they anticipate the move and and they they give you that call Mitchell checks back in Garland heads to the Cavalier bench with 13 points in his back pocket yeah solid effort Cavaliers 44 Nets 41 LeVert Mobley Mitchell Niang and Strus now make up the Cavalier five Mobley was looking inside for L that was red and poked out of bounds the ball stays with the Cs it was a good opportunity there I like what they did because the defender turned his head but he was smart enough to turn back at the right time to deflect the ball O'neale AIT Johnson returns Johnson dealt with a hamstring injury throughout the pre-season in a few full practices Mitchell sends one inside Mobley with the left hand that doesn't go Johnson rebounds Smith scurries into the four Court dumps off to Johnson Johnson the former Sun thought about an entry pass now he gets attacked by Niang that was good defense in the open floor by NE Smith drives to the basket ran into Levert out of bounds it goes the ball stays with Brooklyn a look at Levert on that defensive end and JB loves his two-way hustle oh yeah he definitely he plays both ends of the floor he's healthy now had a great pre-season Smith finds Claxton Claxton laid in the shot clock Bridges back to Johnson who has to hurry Tracked Down by lever L picked up by Smith dumps to Niang Niang fires left that short he grabs his own rebound he will shoot it again gets it again n back to Levert lever puts it on the floor blows past Bridges he missed the shot at The Rim however as Johnson defended now it's Bridges he trots into the four Court down the lane that's rebounded by Mitchell as Mobley got back in a hurry back and forth they go scws dumps off to Levert he knocks It Down K Ken said enough of this running up and down the floor I'mma end it right here Levert with a rise smile on his face after canning the corner three back and forth we go it's the Cavaliers Zone this six-point lead it's the group that's here every single day um it's been their approach I think it's the excitement around the possibilities of what this group um you know could be at the end of the day um you know it's the challenge of blending New pieces with old things where you know success was found so it's you know the chess match of trying to figure out you know how do you implement new things without losing things that you were good at although different Personnel makes it a little you know uh different so that's the fun part of it is just trying to figure all that out that's our rocket mortgage built for Success thought of the first half as the Nets have the basketball he Trail by six Sharpe in toward Mobley Mobley playing with two fouls had to be careful there as Sharpe Loops it up and in yeah he didn't want to commit a foul there I mean he made a good offensive move you have to shake take your hat off to him Isaac Okoro has re-entered Mobley off to Strus Strus puts it up thought he got fouled here's Ben Simmons Simmons slows hands off to Johnson Johnson double clutches and hits wow the Cavalier lead has been trimmed to one Mitchell works on Dennis Smith who had a bounceback season last year in Charlotte wow that pass was a touch ambitious Mobley was able to pluck it away from one of the Nets as Strus now to the basket it's rebounded by Simmons yeah right now their defense has the Cavaliers taking shots they really don't want to take Johnson Rams into Niang a foul is called now be get a late one you can see right here nice move by going inside that time by Strus good move good fake opportunity to get a good opportunity just couldn't knock it down but those are the kind of plays when you move without the ball you get those opportunities it was Simmons who appeared to get a piece of that shot hey it's a so here's M Johnson 3 fifth the Net's current starting lineup is acquired in either the Kyrie Irving or the Kevin Durant deal Bridges and Johnson came from the Suns Den witty and Finney-Smith from the Mavericks in return for Irving and Durant the Net's got those four players AC plus four firsts and a pick SW swap from Phoenix another first two seconds and trade exceptions from Dallas man than got a little bit got the whole house and then the the garage too I me they got everything again they they have some pieces they have some assets the big question mark this season is what are they going to get out of Ben Simmons yeah you're right as Mitchell looks to work inside on Thomas lever Strus good ball movement results in a three that's the way you move the ball around the horn and knock it down deep in the Barclay Center three triples for Strus in his Cavalier debut and Sharpe now throws it away he and Simmons got their signals crossed ball goes around good penetration to force the defense into the middle and then back around to the jump shooter St knock it down we can expect a shift this season in that Cavalier offense JB has been pleading for more ball and body movement as Strus again cans it that's called two in a row from Deep Max Strus in his first half as a Cavalier has knocked down four triples Johnson hangs fires and score that's where the cows went out and got him that's right and he's delivering here's more and more comfortable with each passing practice truce again does he have another yes he does he can shoot it Max Strus is five for seven from long range here in this first half he is a game high 15 Thomas bottled up by LeVert he changed his pivot foot that's a travel and that's where Levert is also very Sharpe on that defensive end Strus doing a good job moving without the ball right there getting into a very solid position that time a stand still shot still goes down JB has said there's more to Max Strus than just the threes it's that constant movement that creates so much gravity yes and the Cavs are on that offensive end of the yeah it it opens up other guys too because he clears a lot of space out and other guys can come in behind him Mell spins on Simmons try to fire over Sharpe Sharpe got a piece of it Simmons strolls into the four Court finds Johnson Johnson picked up by Strus vny Smith comes and gets it Thomas now that's an illegal screen un Sharpe after the hand off he clubbed one of the Cavaliers and he gets whistled for the foul yeah you're right trying to move on those those picks will get you calls every time and that time he definitely moved to the right to try and set the pick Nic Claxton comes back into the ball game Mitchell is watched by Simmons Levert checked by Finney-Smith Finney-Smith is a Plus Perimeter Defender Strus plays through Jones Jones wants Mitchell eventually gets it there Mitchell checks the shot loet now shows four Mitchell rifles one over to Okoro he's going a fire Isaac a contested three it grazes iron Simmons grabs the weak side rebound whoa was one of the that's it was Claxton fell awkwardly three on the way is good as fny Smith hits and Claxton is still down he hit the floor pretty hard that was a strange Collision as he tumbled awkwardly lever uses a Jones Screen fumbled it for a moment gives to Strus pretty good idea as this man is at five threes for those of you just joining us in his Cavalier debut Strus going to work a contested three comes to Okoro Okoro bounces to Levert Levert has to fire as the original shot didn't hit the rim he had to beat the clock and here comes Thomas Thomas through the lane Fades away and score yeah they again they want to focus on good attempts right away they're not worried about any other thing but getting that ball down the Flor floor and scoring as quickly as possible and that's where the Cavs have to have their transition defense ready closing minute second quarter Cavaliers by two Mitchell off to Okoro Simmons has his head up finds Finney-Smith into the corner it goes Johnson breaks Baseline deals it CL pretty ball movement and we're tied at 56 JB wants a timeout the Nets with a push here late in the second whyly today at join dhl.com and by Chevrolet the number one selling family of SUVs in the Cleveland area opening night New York City yes indeed nothing like it and Cavs I think the game is going in Spurs they go where and that's how it is when you're playing against a running team because they get spurts where they're cold they get Spurs where they're hot you just have to stay consistent with your game Cavaliers tonight have taken 22 threes in this first half well above their average from last season on Pace for it that is they've knocked down 10 here as long as you keep moving the ball you're going to have good looks and and and that's where and you got to take it Benny Smith boy he threw it right to spru as once again two the Nets got their signals crossed Simmons with the intended recipient both times Levert to the Elbow his 15 Twitter creeps over the rim but it's no good as Simmons grabs the rebound Simmons to the foul line FS over to Thomas Thomas has been hot in this first half Thomas now has 19 points as he's given Brooklyn his first lead of the year Mitchell gets it right back yes CS come right back and take advantage of it nice little dribble in fre pick for Donovan to knock it down three cabs are now in double figures Strus 15 Garland 13 Mitchell 10 all of Strus's 15 have come via the three-point shot Thomas probes he's not bashful Simmons drives the weak side rebound puts it up missed it from Point Blank Range struce can he save it yes he does lever into the four Court stops fires over Johnson and connects good movement I tell you he is so quick with that first step that the defender nine times out of 10 gets left about a half step behind and that's when he takes the advantage here's vny Smith as Garland got knocked onto his wallet off it goes to Thomas Mobley runs him off the line Thomas cruises to The Rim 21 off the net bench and we have our first flopping technical of the season and that's called on Darius Garland so this is a new rule this year you can have an in-game flopping foul called it results in a technical free throw let's keep our eye on Garland couldn't see it from that replay as there's the technical free throw which ties this game at 61 let's take another look again watch the left side of your screen where where is it there's the indication made by feny Ransom it happened before that can't recall Garland went sprawling across the floor just before that replay began hey Mark so we get our first ingame flop of the Season all right let's see there it is oh man so that was deemed an egregious flop results in the technical as lever to the basket he missed it but Mobley doesn't as Mobley follows and gives the cows a 6361 lead I like the fact that Levert continues to put pressure on the rim cuz that's what opens up the second opportunities for most we'll talk more about that technical foul call in a moment as Thomas with basket Thomas now has 24 points off the Brooklyn bench oh boy number of new rules that we'll visit in the second half yes as We Roll Along here tonight coach's challenge has been changed new player participation policy is mely inside clock winding down first half is over each team shoots at north of 50% and after 24 minutes we're tied at 63 well you kind of figured it was going to happen because again this is an offensive first team and they got hot and that's what happens it's going to take a good solid defensive effort in the second half to beat this team D be right in front of us is having it out with crew chief Mark Davis about that technical call coming up on the Kenley Kia halftime report Kaylee and campy will break it down for the first time team down because he was the Catalyst for that whole first half a look at jock Baugh who took over early last season when Steve Nash in the net parted ways the Nets were so impressed with Von's demeanor and his way with this club that only three months later they gave him an extension through the 2627 season he deserved it oh yeah I mean that was a great thing he did to come in and take this team who was really a bunch of Misfits it seemed like and then um turn him into something that they could play with going down the stretch we're underway in the second half here's Darius Garland the cows and Nets are tied at 63 Mitchell will find Garland Garland into the pain to Coral back to Strus Strus picks up where he left off as Max Strus has now knocked down six triples in his Cavalier debut and that's that play is starting to work now where they penetrate from the left side throw it to the right the right corner and then back out to strs and he knocks it down the Cavs start the second half the way they started the ball game the Nets make one move Finney-Smith starts in place of Johnson we mentioned Johnson missed all of pre-season with an injury hamstring problem hampered him as Mobley gets inside toward Claxton pivoted a number of times and Claxton made the block Bridges now picked up by Okoro Bridges was held to Five Points just one for five in the first half and there he gets induced into a turnover as Mitchell with the interception he is very good at playing the passing Lan on the weak side of the ball Mitchel dumps off the Strus don't leave him there Max Strus has seven shoot it young man woo wake him up welcome to Cleveland young man yes indeed love it Simmons watched by Strus Simmons backing in doesn't want the 10-footer vny Smith that's rebounded by Okoro the Cavs gang rebounded that ball and and that's the key gang rebound but at the same time that was a heat check at the same time though you just want to keep these guys in front of you cuz they are prone to mistakes wow Finney-Smith looked like he led with a forearm as the foul is on garet as Garland ended up into the basket support these threes AC I don't know if the net ever moved no he he shoots him pure I mean he once he gets into that Crouch comes out of that Crouch man he is is right there for the shot JB once again is hot as he has a word with veteran official Mark Davis the rugged Finney-Smith is on the line Vinnie Smith a long time Maverick misses the free throw yeah this style of play seems to fit his game Garland to the Elbow finds Okoro Okoro to the paint shot puts one up gets it back got bridges in the air and Drew the foul good effort that time he was not giving up on that one he was going to stay with that ball and he ended up getting the opportunity to go to the line Okoro got the start in big part to contain Bridges tonight as here's Okoro grabbing the rebound over Bridges and then Bridges commits the foul long way to go AC however the Net's leading score in bridges thus far is just one for five yeah they've done a good job on him and uh what they have to focus on is when Thomas comes in the game they got to be diligent on him now a word from Wayside Furniture come discover Wayside Furniture in akine one of the largest selections of furniture mattresses and accessories in the midwest ask about cash discounts and special financing John Michael Austin Carr and Serena Winters thanks for spending some of your Wednesday night with us opening night here in Brooklyn as CLA it into traffic Simmons got his hand on it but eventually it comes to garet here he is garet Works inside hangs in the air and scores as G has given the Cavaliers a 7365 lead attacking in an open floor Garland contest the three the rebounds grabbed however by Claxton who rescues The Possession Claxton from the elbow deals to Simmons Simmons gets to the paint missed the shot as Simmons is one for five tonight yeah he has a tough time making shots on the Move Strus bounces off to Mo Okoro is the open man didn't when he ran him off the line that ball pinballs back toward midcourt where it's scooped up by Mitchell the shot clock shows five Mitchell to work launches a three Simmons strolls into the four Court he's picked up by Strus try to send an entry pass to Bridges Garland broke it up but Garland commits the foul and with that let's check in with Serena well John with seven triples Max Strus has just set a new franchise record in a Cavaliers deut with most triples prior to that it was J.R Brer on October 29th 2003 been sometime seven triples introducing himself to our Cavalier faithful yeah I think he's doing a great job of it he's he's he's comes as advertised Cavaliers 73 net 67 we heard a lot about Max Strus during the preseason AC in terms terms of changing that offense with his motion not just that three-point shot his ability to create space for his teammates Garland for one he's Garland gets inside lost the ball however and it goes over to the Nets with that space it gives players like garland and Mitchell so much more room to create yes and that's what's so so nice about the whole situation cuz with Strus establishing himself like that just go to his side and you have opportunity Simmons bounces inside side Claxton puts it up gets fouled by Mobley and puts it in M's picked up his third and Claxton has a chance for the three-point play yeah they they are getting some space to operate in that paint and putting putting putting a lot of pressure on Mobley to have to defend them all and he there Strus get over that now that right there was definitely a push one but you have to play through things like that in this league that's that's just the way the league goes so here's Claxton free throws are not his specialty he's a 54% career free throw shooter however he cans that to cut the Cavalier lead to 7370 we four minutes in third quarter Garland angles off of Mobley screen what a pass to Okoro inside he'll dump to Mobley Mobley puts it up that's blocked by Claxton Clon with another rejection Bridges slowed waits for help Simmons that's Ali for Claxton and that was read easily by Garland Garland zigzags inside Strus is passing Ted for Mitchell is flicked out of bounds by Bridges and the ball will stay with the Cavaliers I like the way the Cavs get across that timeline and start immediately looking for places to attack the defense soon as Finney-Smith threw this pass as Garland was working hard he could almost tell by his body line you said I threw that a little low I mean he knew right away we said come back Ball please come back 61 player in Garland easily was able to get up knock it down scws inside draws the foul that's on Claxton who was a step late again when you run plays like that you go at full speed man and when you're going at full speed it's hard for the defense to keep up with you and Strus constantly moving and always cutting man that I this I love the way he plays the game now the foul was caught on the original pool by CLA and on that scw shot so the foul was deemed on the floor just why the Cavs inbounder from the sideline as Mobley takes it right through Claxton as Maxon now is favoring a leg he may have landed on Mobley Laxon came down awkwardly the Cavaliers have taken a 7570 lead that's where Mobley has really gotten stronger and much more aggressive is when he's attacking the basket now look who Isaac Okoro is guarding Thomas went for 24 points in the first half bridge is watched by Mitchell Claxton bloats it up missed the shot well defended by the Cavs truce up ahead to Garland Garland has a cororo Okoro Banks and scores moving the ball down the floor taking advantage of what they give you JB right in front of us just pumped his fist that's what he wants to see in terms of pushing that ball more this season the ball moves faster by the pass than the dribble Thomas drifting three good Thomas now has 27 off the Brooklyn bench at 14 minutes of play but he was celebrating his shot Bley ran the floor Claxton got back Claxton picks up another block that's his fourth of the evening however it will be Cavalier basketball when we come back an action-packed evening here from Brook from long range trues the high Cavalier with 21 points all from three-point range the Cavs acquired Max and ass sign and trade with Miami for Jetty Osman Lamar Stevens and two second round picks and spru has been huge here in Brooklyn so far tonight yeah if he keeps going like this he's really going to give the Cavs a good opportunity to win on the road Mitchell floats it up and in Mitchell's five of nine he has 12 points he's dished out a team high five assists and he really playing a balanced game now he's not he he's getting a little bit of everything a little passing little shooting defense he's playing a solid evening Thomas looking for Sher Sher got it as he was headed back to the floor and couldn't quite guide it in let's check in with Serena well John as can imagine that time out was all about defense JB said look we have to do a better job communicating the screens you've got to help them know where the screen is coming from and Thomas he make him a passer he said look I don't think I've seen that guy pass once make him a playmaker he he hasn't play past onceth Simmons backed into a cororo and gets called for the foul credit Isaac if he doesn't slam into Simmons there Thomas is wide open and watch Okoro on this play make sure he made contact and wow Simmons made sure he made contact with Isaac as well yeah one thing when Isaac is on you it's going to be a collision somewhere and he's not going to be the one getting hurt Serena talked about it in the first half how Max Strus had said when he was with Miami he hated being guarded by Isaac Okoro Serena dug deep into the numbers and said in fact Max Strus did not score a single point last season when being guarded by Isaac Okoro as Levert spins he left that short jumper short that's grabbed by Johnson Johnson moves into the four Court tries to find SHP through it behind him out races lever D when he's a lone man back a Coro with a thunderous Tong you're not going to stop him when they going like that straight to the basket and throw the hammer down the Cavs turn defense into offense Bridges now he's being harassed by LeVert back it goes to Johnson this is the kind of badgering defense that JB has been looking for here tonight as Johnson now in trouble he runs into a coral and Mobly and now Mitchell pokes it away Mitchell all the way anticipating the pass to the weak side great steal by Donovan that late in that was a glorious defensive sequence oh yes in the midst of a 103 run it's a perfect defensive sequence perfect Thomas fires straight up into the Raptors C man him take a tough shot it looked like Sharpe grabbed the rim oh the ball ends up in the hands of Johnson as Johnson lays it in but that those type of efforts right there as long as you get him to miss Cavs will be able to be all right this evening they have to keep him under control here in this second half LeVert hesitates into a jumper that's long out comes Thomas now it's Johnson extra pass goes right back to Johnson Thomas again Thomas looks to drive down the alley he scores Thomas now has 29 and the Cavaliers want a timeout he's putting on his show Thomas in his third season even the Nets close you can see the theater

Strus fires O'neale rebounds if you joined us late Max Strus has seven threes tonight he's seven of 12 from behind the line Thomas wow that would have brought the house down yeah he is a little getting a little bit too uh full of himself here with that shot Levert all the way to the basket but could not finish C's getting a few bad breaks on the offensive end of the floor now Johnson backs up one time finalist for Sixth Man of the Year in Phoenix set up this offensive sequence goes to the Baseline nearly ran out of room finds Den witty Den witty late in the shot clock oh boy that rattles out Strus Coral's the rebound and Out Come the Cavaliers got to break that time he usually hits that corner shot Garland watch by D witty he goes Baseline what a pass there to Jones and Jones lays it in clever pass that time by Garland he got inside gave Jones a great feed for easy layup Garland has dished out four assists Okoro four Mitchell leads the way with five vny Smith heals to dwy they go to Thomas again Thomas toward the basket missed the shot Jones was there he altered it as Thomas and Jones both hit the deck Strus the other way off the KNE Yang Niang ver Baseline deals with the corner Garland back to Levert O'neale chugs into the four Court vny Smith leaks out reverses and scores yeah they had a chance that time to really get a start to get a little separation but again this is an offensive team they know how to score the ball a buck 35 remains in the third Strus now to Jones Strus goes back door he lays it in Nifty pass by Jones JB said one thing that surprised him in Camp is how good of a passer the big man is and Jones was able to find Strus right there that was a nice pass inside but even better move without the ball to go inside that time by Strus Benny Smith almost got Stripped by Niang Niang however commits the foul Darius Garett going to work here in this third quarter setting up his teammates and that was a Nifty feed to Jones yeah doing a good job of waiting his time and that was a perfect lead pass that time to Strus who made another move to the basket without the ball Jones and Garland both are vanderbild a lumps as here's Thomas weaving his way inside Thomas created some space he now has 33 off the Brooklyn B and he's keeping them in the ball game if if they have a chance to win this game it'll be because of him Smith fouls Garland SM one of those veterans brought in there's a look at Thomas we'll pause for a word from DHL supply chain DHL supply chain is hiring for a wide range of salaried operational and functional roles apply today at join dhl.com that was the first foul on the Nets with under two minutes remaining in this third quarter teams will shoot free throws the rest of the way as Mitchell was pursued by Thomas steps back fires a three and hits big basket at the right time make Thomas have to play defense that's also a good way of slowing him down Bridges takes a pass to the rim he banks and scores Mitchell's toe was really close to that three-point line all twos and threes get reviewed at the NBA replay Center Mitchell wants another knew he missed it can he track it down not quite off his foot it goes and it grein out of bounds 31 ticks to go here in the third JB summons Isaac Okoro the final few possessions of this third defensive reinforcement as he'll replace Niang yeah they want to not give up anything this quarter maybe get an opportunity for the way to close the the quarter out with a good shot token pressure by Garland on Smith as Smith hands off to Thomas that's why a coro's out there as he leans on the hot Thomas Thomas is 12 of 18 tonight off that Brooklyn B Thomas finds PNY Smith wide right uhoh nobody boxed out Smith and he lays it in has fall asleep that time the shot clock is off the Cavalier lead is three Garland operates nearly got stripped Penny spin now Scoops it out third quarter is over Downs led by five after one we were tied at 63 at the half that Cavalier lead now is 9087 New York City sets the scene Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers are on top of the Nets 9087 with 12 12 minutes remaining thanks to our Executive Vice President of Replay Pat faroh for that highlight package all five Cavaliers starters scor in double figures led by Max Strus who has 23 points Strus in his first game in wine and gold has knocked down 73s Okoro fouls Thomas JB wanted an offensive foul on Thomas as Thomas got his off arm wrapped around ISAC it looked like he hooked him a little bit but no call again he's a stab yeah definitely a hook there but um he's established himself now so C's going to have to fight through all of this to slow him down a Coro open this game guarding Bridges wow tough shot there by Thomas as Thomas's huge night continues he now has 35 the next highest net has 10 this evening yeah it's amazing it seems like he does this quite a bit when he's in his in his little rhythm Garland for three off the Mitchell feed rebounded by Okoro back to Mitchell the cas set with a fresh 14 opening minute fourth quarter from Brooklyn Mitchell works on Bridges deals back to Levert Levert over Thomas got it huge huge big basket lever has knocked down three triples he has 11 points now off the Cavalier bench Bridges works on a Coro Coral's had tough assignments all night as Bridges elevates and hits but it seems like having Bridges do that is a little different than having Thomas hit those threes garland uses a mo screen feels back to lber can he stay hot no he knew he missed it wide left he chased after it the moment it left his hands Smith now to the basket off to Clon right through his hands but that's a big break as Garland trots the other way here comes Okoro Okoro to the poop boy he got knocked down and knocked down hard Okoro will shoot free throws as he draws the foul I like the intensity that the Cavaliers are attacking within the open floor they are really attacking that hoop and coming with with intensity his it URL down no way you going to stop him going to that basket when he gets like that the foul is on O'neale boy that ball doesn't go through Claxton's hands we're tied at 93 right this building gets re-energized once again instead it's a coral on the line well that's why a good start is good to set the tone for the quarter for the Cavaliers just like they did the first part of the third quarter well the Cavs have teamed up with a local pizza and design company sents pizza and goods to bring you their latest apparel collaboration the collection will be available exclusively at Center Court starting on Saturday Isaac Okoro got the start tonight he now has 13 points grabs six rebounds dished out four assists and and playing some good gritty defense against all of the scores Jarrett Allen is out this evening so is Dean Wade we have a whistle 30 second violation is called on Mitchell Mitchell was planted in the lane so this will be a technical free throw for the Nets anybody can take it it will be Bridges and Bridges 90% free throw shooter last season connects yeah he really when he came here he set a tone for this team and he started them on the right track there they had a good uh season the rest of this way and uh looks like they're trying to start out now on the Good Foot Brides also was Sensational this summer playing for Team USA the FBA World Cup blackton back door Bridges puts it up an in bridges GS the cavali clear lead to one Garland moble Okoro Levert and Mitchell are on the floor Garland watched carefully by Smith Smith runs into a mo screen as Garland tried to go to find a cororo back door we have a whistle and a foul called it's on the Cavaliers lever he tried to get the ball inside I mean and and one of the Nets hit the ball but again back door Play Good Help easy basket for him to finish here's the turnover that c I miss spoke was called on a coral there it is yeah he he tried to get it to uh his player cutting in in Thomas got in the way of it Okoro was creeping back door right Bridges he's out here with Johnson Claxton Smith and O'neale two and 1 half in fourth quarter johnon pulls up Smith tracks it down Smith is wide open and he gives the net the lead all right PS have to get themselves together now they have to stay calm execute the plays knock it down he need a shot here Mitchell can't answer that's batted and grabed by the Nets Smith's taking three shots tonight he's hit all three Paxton directs traffic he finds Johnson this is only the net second lead of the ball game they had a brief lead late in the second quarter Johnson to the basket puts it up and puts it in Jo H likes his team's effort interesting year here for the Nets completely different looking team than the one that started last season Mobley looks to shake his way to the Lane does so spins on Claxton can't get that to go yeah good shot just didn't go down the Nets have momentum here early in the fourth quarter O'neale off the Johnson he got fouled by Strus from behind have strung together a couple of stops here and and that's what it's been I mean that defensively they're not known as a good defensive team but in situations they can play good solid defense again we talked about the change in Personnel a lot of shooters went out but in those trades they got some better defensive players yes no question about that a little more athletic as the Nets are in the midst of a 10-2 run jock Baugh is optimistic that this season they can turn things around defensively as here's Bridges O'neale now toward the basket he'll find it teammate Finney-Smith Taps one off to Smith inside Smith puts it up and in yeah they are really starting to share the ball on offense now and that is really becoming a problem for the cast defense the Nets have gotten a spark Off the Bench not only from Thomas let's be honest the scess second half by Anthony Davis did not help them either and Devon Booker and the Suns looked good outlasting the Golden State Warriors last night I think a lot of us were hoping to see Bradley Field make his debut for the Suns but he was ruled out with low back tightness two terrific matchups last night to open up the NBA regular season as meanwhile the Nets gain momentum here in this fourth quarter they've taken a 10195 lead under eight to go Garland finds a Coro in the corner he's got it yeah that was important basket there and I'm glad that they took their time and and Darius did a great job of finding the open man remember late last season it was Isaac Okoro in the other Corner in this building down at the same end hit his first game winner of his career now he defends bridges on this end Coro right up on on him Bridges waits for a Claxton screen get picked up by neang Fades away can't hit Strus rebounds well done defensively SCU skips into the four Court finds Garland Garland works on Finney-Smith Finney-Smith knocked it away Bridges now in on Levert to the basket lays it up and lays it in yeah those type of turnovers you always get scored against because they're in the back court the Cavs for the most part have been pretty good protecting the basketball tonight that's just their ninth turnover they forced 14 Levert for three Smith has played a big role off the Brooklyn bench dumps off to Claxton Clon heals back up top to Finney-Smith Smith that's his first Miss of the evening bench scoring tells a big part of the story here tonight as the Nets reserves have out score the Cavs bench 6117 yeah is unbelievable and mainly because of Thomas Niang to Leber great pass inside to Okoro yep patience is all it takes let the defense make the mistake it's a one possession game as we approach the Midway point of the fourth quarter blackton will find Vinnie Smith Bridges has six with which to work back it goes to Finney-Smith he'll twirl to the paint deal to O'neale and it's a shot clock violation as lebert got out there quickly O'neale hesitated and the Cavs Force the turnover this is the perfect time of game to get a 24 second turnover off of that that is so perfect that the defense is in full form when you get those type of turnovers right there you see okoro getting a nice opportunity to the inside Ben Simmons has played 21 minutes he got the start at point guard he will check in at the next dead ball along with Spencer Den witty me he's harass by O'neale his former teammate in Utah lebert in toward O'neale Slams on the brakes deals with the cutter it's Strus Strus slays it in Max Strus has 25 points to go along with 10 rebounds this is his third career double double as he's cut the net lead to one good opportunity a man moving out the ball is always a good Target bridges into the corner O'neale missfires Mitchell eventually grabs the loose ball that Cavs Now look for the lead Mitchell sporting the bright blue shoes tonight deals the truce now it's Levert Levert bobbled momentarily rights himself looks to drive off balance shot rebounded by O'neale under five to go from Brooklyn these teams last season were no strangers of tight games and tonight has been no different timeout Brooklyn it and by SeatGeek get your seat in a seat Nets 103 Cavaliers 102 449 to go it's the season opener from Brooklyn T return home tonight for Friday Saturday back to back Oklahoma City and Indiana as meanwhile Ben Simmons goes through the lane sends it back to den witty once more to Simmons Simmons puts it up and in Simmons has four points on the evening he has grabbed nine rebounds and dished out a team High nine assists they like to put him in the middle of the offense and and run things off of him so he can use his passing ability and driving ability Mitchell crosses over Finney-Smith can't get the loose ball Simmons on the move to Johnson Bridges now hangs in the air dumps off to Finney-Smith Finney-Smith runs into traffic and he travel that right there Strus did a great job of cutting the Baseline off and then Donovan comes into from the top side and that caused him to travel Strus right there at the Baseline he cuts the Baseline off and Donovan comes in they trap him right there cause him to turn the ball over Cav defense stepping up four to go Mitchel works it off to Mo Strus wanted it eventually grabs it that's knocked out of bounds by the active Finney-Smith Finney-Smith's just such a big strong Defender 67 to 122 PBS yeah he's a good player not flashing nothing fancy he just gets the job done on the nightly basis and that's value to a lot of teams JB bicker staff's Cavaliers finished 51 and 31 last season there's a foul call before the ball was inbounded by Simmons so by rule the Cavaliers will get a free throw here and keep possession very important to hit these type of shots CU now they have a chance if they can hit this shot and score either take the lead or tie the score now a word from the Ohio Lottery excuse me oh excuse me oh know your limits both in line and when you oh man I'm so Sor get more tips like this at keep itun oh.com that was Mitchell's first free throw attempt a big free throw disparity tonight the Nets have taken 20 the Cavs but eight and most of the foul shots have come in transition they they are very good at transition Cruz comes and gets it cororo can't quite save it the ball belongs to the Nets Strus has hoisted 13 threes tonight the Cavs has a team 41 nearly half their shots here's Simmons BS he into the four Court wants Bridges finds Bridges bridges backs up as he's picked up by Strus loose ball batted by Okoro track down down by Strus Strus slows his pass was tipped by Den witty but a whistle and a foul is called yeah Isaac looked like he was hit on that play with foul is on Bridges JB wants an explanation here and they're going to review this here comes Mark Davis watch the middle of the screen oh boy a appear to get hital fler foul he appeared to get hit below the belt so the cows wanted a review there and that's what Mark Davis will grant yes but things have heated up here the last three minutes I mean and then this is what you expected the way the game had been going the whole first half it was back and forth back and forth now the Cavs will to be the one that goes forward here the last 3 minutes now if this foul is deemed unnecessary it will rise the level of a flagrant foul if unnecessary and excessive that's a flagrant two now both penalties carry with them two free throws a flagrant two adds an ejection yeah he definitely stopped and purposely wanted to stop his momentum there you see the Bow by Bridges just a strange play in the middle of the floor right well the one thing for sure you could upon review it has been determined that the mped by Bridges was an illegal act but there was nothing unnecessary nor excessive it's a common file reset the game clock to 328 the shot clock to 321 Cleveland's ball so there you have it it did not rise to the level of a flagrant foul again the two factors are unnecessary and excessive right neither was found there in the review but now again the Cavs have the opportunity now to tie this ball game up with a good execution of a play we have a time out on the floor we'll take a break as well down the stretch we come here in Brooklyn 328 remains in regulation the home Nets are on top of JB picker staff's Cavaliers 105 103 the Cavs have the pole coming out of this timeout and this possession very important get a score here to tie the game will take the lead will really change the momentum or the feel of the game right now because right now Brooklyn feels they have an opportunity to C can snatch it right from him the lengthy Ben Simmons stands right in front of Max Strus spru is looking to inbound he's joined by a cororo Mitchell Mobley and Levert 325 to go Mitchell checked by Bridges now picked up by Johnson on the switch Mitchell looks to penetrate took a bump from Claxton that's rebounded by Bridges and ja BAU wants a timeout so possession by possession we go will step away good theater here in Brooklyn late in the fourth little bit of everything tonight 18 points grabbed five rebounds dish out a team high five assists grabbed a team High three Steals on the defensive end a very solid allaround ball game now they have to come up with some defensive stops to make it all work Thomas is back in the ball game Isaac Okoro with the block Thomas has 35 points off the Brooklyn bench Jack Bon goes to him here Okoro gets the stop put the stop sign on him get that weak stuff out of here Okoro however gets hit for an illegal screen as he dumped Bridges here's the block good opportunity there went up straight up did not get into his body which was great and then right here which to me m i mean he he he didn't he he he stopped but he didn't stop in time but what about a fraction of a second Here Comes Thomas picked up by Okoro O'neale now off it goes to Bridges bridges is watch by Mitchell switched on to by Strus five CHS on the shot clock Bridges to work has the dump back to O'neale O'neale double clutch has missed it the ball's tipped Sharpe got a hand on it it's grabbed by Okoro Okoro with a big time play it was Finney-Smith actually who kept that ball alive for a moment as Mitchell with a gorgeous move to the basket Donovan Mitchell ties this game at5 he loves that move where he takes that dribble into you forces you to react to it then he lifts up over your hand and lays it in Mitchell now has 20 we're locked up at 105 205 to go from Brooklyn Mitchell Badgers Bridges almost forced the turnover Bridges gets it back works it off to O'neale oh CL three by Roy O'neale good solid defense just continue to work and work hard mitell down the lane grabbed by O'neale the Nets have the basketball in a 108 105

go here in the fourth the cows will huddle and look to come from behind they Trail this ball game 109 105 as Strus his tied an NBA record for most threes in a game with a new team first contest with a new club he has seven here tonight seven of 13 from behind the line he also has his third career double double 25 points and 12 PS and the Cavs AC can use a couple more here down the stretch with 136 to go trailing by four as that is ARA to pull this one out they need up both both ends of the floor they're going to have to tighten up here on both ends of the floor to pull this one out nine of 17 from the field he's seven of 13 from long range couple of buckets couple of stops the Cavs look to get out of Brooklyn with a win it's been a long time since the Cavs have won a road opener open right long long time last time was against this net organization couple of decades ago look to fck that Trend here tonight as here's Donovan Mitchell he's picked up by Bridges Nets 109 Cavalier is 105 Mitchell bounces inside there's Mobley off to an open Garland Okoro grabs the weak side rebound we have a foul call it's on the floor it's on the Cavaliers it's on Okoro zakuro was hitting the offensive glass keep your eye on 35 and he bumped Mikal Bridges before he went up for that rebound again not a lot of contact but there's the call and because the Cavs are over the limit it will result in bridges free throws as he looks to extend this four-point Brooklyn lead yeah and again the the two free throws if he can knock them both down the Cavs have to really can't afford to give up any more points after this we mentioned bridges last season was one of the best free throw shooters in the game at nearly 90% Nets 110 Cavaliers 105 Bridges has 16 points tonight the big story has been the Brooklyn bench led by Thomas Thomas poured in 36 points and 24 minutes of play he was he's been he was off the chart I mean nobody saw that one coming theet bench is out scor the Cavs bench 6517 wow 120 to go as the Cavs have one more time out at their disposal Mitchell a two he's got it Mitchell tonight has 22 points just now a four-point game time for a couple of stops here partner oh yeah that's what's going to happen Bridges picked up by Okoro now Johnson Johnson in towards Strus step back blocked by Strus big play Mobley up ahead to Strus in on fin Smith puts it up and draws the foul Big Time play by Max Strus as his fine Cavalier debut continues not only can he shoot the ball he can play defense good solid effort by Strus boy this is a big time play on the defensive hand as Johnson has that blocked by Strus and then Strus leaked out good alert pass by Mobley though to get it to him and attack that hoop in this situation Cru has not been to the line tonight had it all the way we knew it was in all the time Cru is an 82% career free throw shooter Thomas re-enters Cruz has made this a onep possession game with one more coming that's 11 Cavaliers 10 n now this is the possession they have to have defensively O'neale is picked up by Garland J Bon imploring hisa get going how about that rip by Mitchell Showtime so good at doing that oh he's good at that he does it so many times Mitchell ties this game of 11 that was his fourth steal of the evening Johnson now boy he can feel the pressure in this building now on the Nets home crowd has gone quiet Johnson in some trouble here he's out around the perimeter working on Mobly Johnson to the basket runs out of options almost walked Bridges off his leg oh no and a foul caught on Mitchell smitchell rolled on to Bridges with only 1 second remaining on the shot clock the cows with aggressive pressure and a bad luck foul there as Mitchell rolled onto the leg of bridges how about this play as Mitchell with the steel Mitchell with the pick six to tie this ball game at 11 you make those type of steals when you are aggressive great time there he just lost his balance rolled up on his leg so here's Bridges with 19 seconds remaining he'll shoot two Bridges a six of seven from the line this evening and the Cavs had the Nets in a lot of trouble there's only one second left on the shot clock again you can't fault Mell he was hustling it was a big the reason why the Nets were down to only 1 second and in trouble near the corner well I mean yeah that's that's part of the game there what happened that particular play I mean they were going after the ball together and it was the games on the line the Cavs do have a timeout remaining Bridges eyes the target he has 19 points tonight JB will take that that time out only after he barks at official fenasy Ransom who made the call so now let's see what the Cavs can draw up here with 19 ticks to go they'll Advance the ball into the four Court off the timeout they Trail the Nets on opening night 113 11 the opportunity is there now opportunity is there execution which means making the shot the Cavs starting five had been on the floor Strus Okoro Mobley Mitchell and Garland all five are in double figures Darris levera is as well the Cavs have hit 16 triples here this evening they don't need a three here they have unloaded 42 tonight have the Cavs well again that's part of the new philosophy on the offensive end of the floor they move the ball they move the and people get in good position so the shot is there so you take it Okoro has a pair of Threes Mitchell three Levert three Strus seven Donovan Mitchell strides back onto the floor grew up in the New York City area Mau in his Cavalier debut has 27 points and 12 rebounds but opportunity is there now and then and again you have time so you don't have to rush things you have time to get the shot you want the Cavs are out of timeouts the Nets have two remaining and here we go viil wow runs over Johnson he's open for three he knocks it down Donovan Mitchell with 12 seconds remaining has given that Cavaliers the lead and that one that's one of his favorite plays he takes that hard dribble gets the defense to try stop him and back off right there knocks it down deep in the Barkley Center Donovan Mitchell shoot it young man Johnson was trying to draw the foul he doesn't get it boy you take a risk there sliding across the floor and leaving Donovan Mitchell all by his Lonesome but that should be a flopping call right there that was a flop we should get a free throw for that one you saw the reaction of the Cavalier bench 12 seconds remain Mitchell has given the C Cavaliers a 114 113 lead a dramatic comeback here down the stretch in the final 2 minutes and now the Cavs need one more stop to close the show right and defense is what they hold they had on tonight they have to finish it with defense good defense but all evening they've been doing a super job defending the basket stealing the ball forcing guys to take shots they don't want to take that's the type of efforts you need in this game to win it and hopefully they've done it with a good opportunity here on the defensive end good steal by Donovan there that was super you knew it had to be initiated on that defensive end AC I mean that's the identity of this club it was last season and yes we're going to see some new things offensively but really JB is said hey we're still a defensive team and that's where you have to make our money well the way I look at it now if the Cavaliers can continue to develop the offensive end and keep that defensive Focus they're going to have a nice nice year 12 seconds to go O'neale to inbound the Cavs need a stop here's Thomas he has 36 tonight Thomas gets it back three seconds left tough way off Johnson got it off the time and he missed it the Cavaliers get the stop Donovan Mitchell hits the game winner an opening night in Brooklyn below to the Cavaliers yes the Cavaliers doing a good thing and they fought back and forth back and forth both teams are going in in offensive Direction and then all of a sudden the defense steps up and gets an important stop at the end Thomas had been killing the Cavs all day long and all of a sudden they can't hit the side of the backboard that that's what the Cavaliers did they put the solid defense on it you know in Brooklyn had 12 seconds with which to work and I guarantee that is not the look that jock BAU was looking for Thomas with a drifting off balance shot he's hit a couple of those here tonight as Thomas finishes with 36 but again Nats a lot of time to move and get into an offensive set the Cavs just kept them around the perimeter basically for the entire possession right and and and they never let Thomas go to his right so that made him back up and have to start again and that back up starting again with the clock running you can see there coach started to rub him on let's speed up speed up then it's hard to speed up when you have to back up first Cavalier Road win in a season opener in 23 years it happened against this Nets organization the gavs snap that drought and Serena is alongside one of the men of the hour max Strus who hit 7even threes in his Cavalier debut before we get to that we're going to send it back to the studio we're here what JB bigger staff has to say we'll get player reaction as well stay right there Kaylee and Camp are next with the Wayside Furniture postgame show the Cavs come from behind for a dramatic 114 113 Victory see you a seven three-pointers in a debut in a Cavs uniform that also ties an NBA debut record for most threes I know you're not about individual statistics but when you hear that that's got to mean something to you yeah we won the game that's all that matters so uh glad my teammates were able to find me in open spots I just hit open Easy shots and the ball went in tonight uh but we found a way to win that's all that matters this is your debut in a Cavs uniform how did the culture of this team drive with you as a player that's huge winning I'm all about winning whatever it takes to win that's all that matters Max you got Donovan Mitchell on your side tonight to see him have that shot in the spot that he likes to take it how much confidence did you have in him to hit that game winner absolutely I mean I was wide open too so I kind of wanted it but uh no I'm living with him taking that shot every every day of the week um twice on so he he did what he did that's that's why Donan Mitchell is Donan Mitchell
