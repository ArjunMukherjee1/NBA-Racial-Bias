 the Clippers really turn you over they climb into the basketball so you have to take care of it and defensively let your ball pressure your strength and numbers outweigh Los Angeles tonight and as Vanessa mentioned in her segment and e may mentioned following that loss to the Warriors the rockets in these last two games against the Kings and the Warriors have kind of gotten away from what they had been doing to get them that great record to start the season in the first place and now coming at a play tonight trying to end their first losing streak of this season has done nearly had his pocket picked by amend Thompson Kevin Porter Jr pressure kicks it to Dunn they give him space to take the three and he makes the three yeah he was dared to take a lot of Threes in the last two meetups and sure he was frustrated and worked on his shot a little bit more coming into this third matchup the both teams playing without their offens of engines in Fred Van Vleet and James hard so we'll see how things go there's Smith on the Block the back down the step through rising up and getting the shot to go down and that's what I mentioned in the open Ryan this is a smaller team that the Clippers have out on the floor and Jabari should be able to get over get those shots over their Defenders all game long and especially if they're going to put a small on them those are the matchups he's to take advantage of him Norman Powell how great has he been playing this season probably the most improved candidate he keeps up 24 a game of career high shooting almost 51% from both the floor and from three both career vs one the teammates right there y Sengun on Kevin Porter Jr. kind toward the chair from out from underneath him just a moment but Alperen was able to regain his balance and score yeah love that from Alperen take advantage no help comes it's barbecue chicken go ahead and get a bucket por on the Move turned back tried to go to Zubac nearly had a stolen now whs and his hook shot goes down he's averaging career highs of both scoring and rebounding this season that's where Zubac is best you know catching and finishing he can score with either hand he's got excellent size leads the NBA in total rebounds coming into play they're the best defensive rebounding team the Rockets are best offensive rebounding team they almost turn it over Jae’Sean doesn't take the three now Dillon Brooks who will the Rockets of course really struggle to shoot the ball against the Warriors what we just saw is what you can expect a lot couple of these possessions as done gets that shot little floater to go uh to be a little Helter Skelter not as clean as you're normally used to seeing with Fred on the floor Green from the wing his Hier arching three is short fou downhill absorbed some contact with Thompson and finishes the play off so the Clippers now up by five and Norman Powell maybe his two worst games of the Season versus Houston so he's going to have a lot to prove a about 11 points per game and only shot about 28% against the rockets in those two losses at Toyota Center one of which was a cup game as Rockets of course won their group and will host the Warriors when we turn home Smith almost had a stall now one thing that the Clippers do have are a lot of guys who can pressure the ball and come up with Steals and deflections so the Rockets better off taking a contested shot than turning it over and starting to clipers fast break here tonight loock winding down Rooks quick release three that rims down yeah boy again you know you got to play with force and move the basketball you're going to get the looks that you like and I think the one thing for the Rockets is getting your speed set getting prepared to shoot and Norman Powell over aggressive here especially knowing why James Harden is out so that's what he's going to be asked of Craig you see there the ball movement late in the shot clock Dillon Brooks delivers and he's really been you know in in spurts just huge for the Rockets this season both teams are rested entering play here tonight the Rockets last played on Thursday the Clippers last played on Wednesday and they were blown out by the Minnesota Timberwolves and they don't play again the Clippers until Friday December the 13th at Denver so this is their only game in well over a week as the Rockets get the ball back and here comes Amen Thompson to the rim with a big time throw down in traffic my goodness he just climbed Kevin Porter Jr liers working around the horn there's Derrick Jones Jr and he's able to finish at The Rim I think it took the Mavericks a little bit of time to get used to playing without him obviously they've gotten their acting year but he was so vital to their success last season he's having a good year here with the cers as Sengun scores again good to see some offensive flow but the rockets need to get stops and that's the one thing between these two losses is kind of the flow communication uh lack of one-on-one play where the Rockets success was really going out and shutting teams out done on Sengun shoots over the top and again the Clippers regain the lead back and fourth we go good offense for both teams to start they're six of Nine the Rockets are five of their first seven and again Kris D you know he knew that he'd be challenged from coach eeme udoka offensively and you know normally a guy who's going to play Within the flow he's been aggressive Sengun had 16 points against gold state which snapped his five game streak of 20 plus nice find and then the score that should have been an an one looked like he got ped he was pushed the men Thompson is certainly excelled as a starter in his young career Kevin Porter Jr. back to Dunn Brooks will post Dunn falls down spins away from it but un un fortunately misses it but gets the ball right back again a big key of those Second Chance points and see a men Thompson here with the start for Fred and he's been great in his minutes and I think that's just excellent that you know sometimes when guys come off the bench they don't have the same energy that they play with when they started but men's still been pretty productive both teams getting the majority of their early scoring in the paint the Rockets already have 12 in the paint the Clippers have 10 as Houston coughs it up quarter the crossover little off balance and misses everything and then Dillon Brooks got pushed shoved out of bounds towards Clippers owner Steve Balmer sitting along the Baseline as we have a uh timeout here of the foul on the Clippers the Rockets with the lead 557 to go in the first and how about that finish California this place is pretty awesome incredible Concourse there facial recognition to get into some concession areas virtual Papa shot type games and there's a look at the very unique an incredibly steep wall that they have here in in Dome now I got to admit it's not it's kind of sparsely populated at the particular at this particular moment but it's very Steep and there are no luxury boxes interrupting that wall makes up about a quarter of all seats in the building fans have to prove that they're actually Clippers fans you can't can't wear opposing team's gear in there um I they believe it's first come first serve you come in you get your seat it's very Steep and ultimately when the Rockets do attempt some free throws here at this end of the floor in this half it has affected opposing teams at the fine a lot this season because of the fans and also because of the the depth perception with the angle and the steepness of that wall it is very unique what it is is you know when you're shooting the dep reception helps but the opposing team didn't they throw up all the you know charades and kind of distractions and hey Craig got three games of big Steven Adams yep Jalen green contorts his body and somehow gets it to go contort is right I don't know how he ends up bitting that ball through the basket from the opposite side of the rim rockets need a big gain from him with Fred Van Vleet  out now to two boot that was a deep two pow was looking for the call to get it Rockets have scored six straight off the pick Green for the free line over two bots in and out and that's the game plan you know attack Zubac as long as he going to sit in that deep drop and that Time Powell did get the call on Brooks so again Norman Powell you know he's not shy here tonight he knows he's got the Great green light with no James Harden and having a Brisk discussion with the referee yeah again that was going back to the previous play that he shot it should have gotten a foul call there's a look at James Harden Rockets fans join us for lift off with full half or quarter 2024 2025 season ticket memberships call 713 75873 to speak to our team for details on locations and pricing for more information please head to rockets.com Powell's also a very good free throw shooter by 84% who needs the wall when you've got me you and the wall Ral I am the wall I am the Rockets wall as J sha Tate gets some early run here stepping in for Jamari Smith Jr again no Fred man ble T East still out in concussion protocol and Jae'Sean Tate's not 100% healthy either dealing with some lower back back pain but getting some some early run hasn't played much this season JT's lost some weight man he looks in excellent shape and even when he doesn't play I'm telling you JT puts in his work cuts and then runs into his own guy him man Thompson and still lays it up and in what a luxury representing tonight for the Stay Ready crew I'm telling you JT is probably the hardest worker on this ball Club and then Steven Adams picks up the foul on the Jordan Miller Drive Miller more opportun man he is a bull getting down fi 10th straight appearance for him after playing in just four of their first 15 games in both of the games against the Rockets he had some good minutes and some good production and now we're going to have a timeout and I believe a coach's challenge here on that last foul call I believe they showed the Whirl there's the green light in fact we have a timeout here we'll take it coach's challenge for e adoka and as of right now it's a 1914 game in favor of Houston very successful coach's challenge for a couple of reasons one the foul initially called on Steven Adams was taken off the board and two because there was a foul by Miller on Adams obviously proximate to the play that's new with the revie system this year an offensive foul was given to Jordan Miller so you took one away from Adams you gave one to Miller and it's Rockets basketball yeah I love that officiating and great job there from coach e udoka and surprised stepen Adams didn't make a fuss got of threw us off I got to admit I'm a little surprised they missed that in real time well referees are are looking for body language and you know just appeared that he you know contacted big Steven ber trying to work on green able to step back there on that block got that one to go he air balled one earlier from near that same spot off the pick Green knifing into the lane stepping through draws a crowd kicks the tap Corner three is no good and then knocked out of bounds last Touch by Los Angeles Crush 14 here for the Rockets excellent basketball there from Jalen green you love his assertiveness getting downhill and then felt the crowd collapse and hit a wide open JT Adams able to free up Dillon Brooks who's hit the only three so far for the Rockets who are now one of six from downtown but they have scored 16 of their 19 in the paint to make up for the four shooting from the perimeter but again that's something that unfortunately we've seen a lot of this season as Zubac is able to hoer it in for two he's having a tremendous season that loss for the Clippers in their last game here to Minnesota ended up snapping a nine game winning streak at home Jalen green up top feathers in the three great ball movement there from the Rockets I think every rocket touched the ball on that possession and imagine Calvin Murphy loving that one of course this is a very important game as Zubac scores again especially from The Rock perspective they win here they win the tiebreaker of the Clippers and of course the stand is uned Seas of the Western Conference are going to be super tight Adams and green not on the same page so it results in a turnover and an easy one for Powell yeah Steven Adams different than Alperen Alperen you can throw it to him with his eyes closed and he's going to find a way to come out of the pack with the ball now we got a whistle so again Rockets got to be mindful especially against the Clippers with those turnovers that's something that they do as a group deric Jones Jr just picked up the foul Nick fatum has come in for the Clippers veteran in his 17th year originally drafted by the Rockets with 25th pick in 2008 didn't do much against the rockets in Houston did appear in both of those games and hadn't scored in the last two for LA T sweeping through the lane Miss tip TR Adams also no good Adams with the rebound reading that Scot report Thompson stepping through kicking it back out to Jalen green his three is up and down good basketball I don't know how Amen ends up finding Jalen and Jalen said man that pass was so nice I got to finish this shot second made three for Jalen green two assists now for R man Thompson off the double pick comes Kevin Porter Jr. the Leaning triple try is Off the Mark now Steven Adams remember in that last game at gold state had his most impactful and effective game for the Rockets when things were not going the Rockets way a on holiday getting some run now a green and it's blocked by Jones and all that length well of course Jones is a terrific leaper but the Rockets get it back and here comes take to Adams who softly dunks it down good minutes from Jae'Sean Tate had a nice rebound got some assist in the ball game but again man JT just plays with a high motor and this is a guy who started two three seasons ago for the rocket so you know hats off to JT for doing whatever is asked of him Zubac trying to back down then goes with the drop step but misses the shot along the Baseline out of dribble hand off with Steven Adams setting those picks holiday for three Steven definitely got away with a 3 seconds there Never Enough delayed man he was in the lane for a while and the shot drops for the Clippers Kevin Porter Jr drills it from the perimeter inside of 30 seconds tough angle quarter three Jalen green wow with the defender in his face and again lock its need aggressive Jalen green this could be one of those games like Philly where he goes off I don't know it'll be 40 but he's got the right mindset no question about it great start for him with 11 in the first quarter is third made three quarter circles kicks Miller up top and he answers with a three of his own Rockets with some time for one last shot Here Comes green off the pick got it off in time and it is short as the first quarter comes to a close but a great start for that young man he's got 11 points he's made three threes the Rockets initially were dominating the paint and then it was Jalen Green from the perimeter and when you add it all up it's 30 to 28 Houston after on Space City home network well the Rockets had a lengthy film session yesterday before their practice at UCLA and head coach eme udoka used a large portion of that time to preach the concept to his team of never getting too high and never getting too low he said look we haven't really accomplished anything yet I've done five interviews in the last week and it doesn't really mean anything coach said his message was don't get your head filled with that we are a game or two from being eighth place don't get caught up when it comes to social media he said I never understand why players would check social media I don't even have it then he quoted Greg papish and said people's op opinions of you are none of your business so Craig and Ryan the main message yesterday drown out the noise both good and bad lock in and focus yeah that's what has gotten the Rockets to this point to this season outside of these last couple of losses I mean the Rockets still are Sengun Works Baseline and just works over the clippers for two as he's come back into the game to start the second quarter but look as disappointing as especially that loss was again to a no Steph Curry no Draymond Green gold state War team their 15th straight loss that the Rockets still offered their best start since going 19 and4 in 2017 Jabari back in stonewalls Miller again plays great defense but Miller somehow finds a way to get the shot up and in really good defense by Jabari but a hat tip to that young man better offense shot right over taller Jabari now he'll step into that three it's the time to run a lot of wedge nice the post action for Sengun and good shot there from Jabari getting his get back probably frustrated he gave up that layup Rockets sworn Kai Jones Sheppard in doesn't take the shot probably should have not a holiday and he misses the three short you get an open look and today's NBA on a fast break you take it order on La kid Aaron holl B Highland awkward looking shot I think he thought he was fouled just kind of let that one go bones Highland is having a little bit of a Renaissance season though with the Clippers Here Comes Sheppard the holiday almost stolen by Porter gets it back and now we have a whistle and it's going to be on is it Kai Jones down low working on Sengun Kai Jones probably the second time watch Sengun went in for a rebound he just went and face checked him so the Clippers don't have a mere coffee available in this game outside of James Harden he injured his right shoulder in pregame warm-ups in his out they're also without Mo bomba who's been seeing a lot more minut didn't play against the rockets in both those games in used to because he was out with the knee injury but he's out here for knee injury management so again they're they're they're pretty thin still know kawi Leonard although they do expect him back in the week and a half at some point before Christmas as Jabari got the offensive rebound and then got fouled on the putback attempt and the Clippers want this to be looked out and challenged by tyou but I don't think he seems to be inclined to do so so jabori will go to the free throw line as Kevin Porter Jr picks up his first foul as Rockets have matched their biggest lead here at five at least aade free throw give them their new biggest lead here so hopefully that will happen here's the first into the wall and he makes it so the wall didn't affect your baring and now a word from oam injury lawyers now opposing teams are shooting under 72% at the line at this end of the floor shooting free throws into the wall now there are a lot of people really directly behind the basket but this wall goes way up and the rest of that section again as of right now is sparsely populated but the steepness and the weirdness of that has affected opposing teams but obviously didn't affect Jabari there are 51 in all as the Rockets have their biggest lead and that didn't last long as Miller continues to score the ball he's got eight with Ty when he raved about Jordan Miller spinning through three Clippers Defenders ultimately got clobbered and he'll step to the line and Alperen knows he he felt it at guy Jones was going to be somewhere trying to block his shot and that to scort get to his chest beat him and know that he's going to be you know looking to leap and block those shots right behind you all right so two free throws here for operan shung we'll see how the uh the wall affects him and it does he missed a short on that first one time out for our New Balance Fearless approach youngest centers to reach 900 plus assists an NBA history Alperen Sengun at the top of that list 22 years in 13 one days young he goes one for two Highland to Dunn his three off the front of the rim Ricochet to Holiday Jae’Sean directing traffic now at the high post of Smith lot of bumping and eventually a foul is going to be called onone two with a lot of history yep going back to last season Peter Griffin and the chicken man I told you going at it man I don't think they want to lose any more money but they do well you know what I know e may mentioned that to stay off social media but these recent uh Family Guy edits on Twitter SLX have been very entertaining so like somebody's ready for Instagram that's what I hear nope NOP not not that in that regard I will still heed eem's warning Sheppard from threee offensive Rebound Sengun in traffic back to Holiday and he gets it to go there you go man how good has Aaron holiday we got a timeout tyou calls it Rockets go up eight 4133 that was their sixth made three holidays first the offensive rebound and that's what this those typically lead to which are wide openen kickout threes bu Rooms To Go don't miss mattress monk going on now and by Jack of the Box unwrapped 24 days of free gifts on the Jack app through December the 24th one of the unique features of this new building is the fact that every single high school jersey in the state of California is represented here over 1500 of them and if you played for the Clippers and you went to high school in California you are represented and Ryan there is your high school Jersey oh man that is pretty cool and just unbelievable man the skinny kid from Pasadena remembered uh so I'm thankful man in fact I think there are a total of 1550 High School Jersey represented at every High School in the state of California as the Clippers make another three bones Highland coming out of the timeout again he is really shooting it well this season over 41% from long range and that would be that is a career high Here Comes holiday just Smith can't get the tree off drives on Jones had it Stripped Away get the Clippers do come up with a bunch of steals and can force turnovers filler squares up and then Ricochet is over to jaari you see Batum is now matched up with Sengun take him to the block and score this is the advantage and part of why e got Ali out and got to get him back in again against the second unit of the Clippers he's called for a walk some Happy Feet he doesn't like the call but that was the right call and you saw eay immediately saying get on the Block go wear him out that's the reason we have you in against the Clippers second unit is this is our Vantage here with no Fred avail able tonight with with KN sess Miller through the lane runs it up and in he's the first Clipper in double figures so he continues to play well against the Rockets this season he's four for seven now he's got 10 he can Aaron holiday on the Move passes up the little Runner try to kick it in the corner and threw it away and then Miller feeling it a little bit thought about the throw now to Highland he comes through the lane over the top of Sengun and he scores second unit has brought a lot of energy coach Go's had enough here yep he'll call a timeout seven straight for the Los Angeles Clippers the rocket still lead but they only lead by one and as we head the break here we'll check with Kevin and Calvin who were hanging out in the rooms to go Lou and uh what we talked about this year was being more consistent and um you know it's our first two game back toback loss and so we want to correct the write the ship there pretty quickly but um just get back to what we were doing well yeah that's the Rocket's identity they have to outwork people and if they don't outwork people because they've yet to find consistent shooting they can get into trouble and that's what we've seen the last couple of ball games is try to get back on track Rockets called this time out also because a Clippers ran off seven straight and just over a minute's worth of play as their eight-point lead has been trimmed to one with seven and 17 to play in this second quarter again the Rockets do come back home and take on the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday in that elimination quarterfinal Cup game of the NBA cup the Rockets win they go to Las Vegas for the semis and hopefully the finals if they lose then the Rockets will hit the road to take on the loser of the Oklahoma City and Dallas game in their quarterfinal match up at the NBA cup coverage on Wednesday starts at hope to join us if you can't come out to Toyota Center and watch the game in first not not to mention the Rockets like to snap a 15 game stage Thompson stepping back had to as the Rockets played deep into that possession had to take that shot missed it yeah Rockets took far too long to get into that set over the top to Batum some trouble with the catch Here Comes col driving slipping and still has the ball gets swarmed is somebody help that guy and now he's going to get tied up and we're going to have a jump ball and the ball pressure is now frustrating Houston so they've got to take care of the basketball here and be mindful see Aaron Rocking The Twist looking like twins with his brother new holiday of the Boston Celtics we do have another little bit of a injury update Derrick Jones Jr is now out for the remainder of the game with some hamstring soreness so no Harden and remember he's dealing with sore hammy and that is what ultimately turned him into an indestructible NBA player and two someone who was relatively human when it came to injuries so you got to be careful with James Harden his hammies and now Derrick Jones Jr is out they're all without Mo Boma M Coffee hurt himself in pregame warm-ups it's not been the best of days here for the Clippers it's a long NBA season James hard Mr Houston right there now second all time in May three has ended up tying Ray Allen in that last game against the rockets and pass him in their next game also 17th on the all-time scoring list next up on that list is uh Tim Duncan but you got to be careful with soft tissue injuries now with James Harden's legs actually I think technically it's a coin sword is here tonight that hamstring that really got him in Brooklyn but those soft tissue injuries now that he's 35 affect him a lot more than they did when he was 25 as we have Co not sure stoppage at play there was an equipment malfunction right here Rockets have to be mindful of the ball pressure and offensively have been struggling to get into sets and since mum has been Barn chin they come into Dunn now to Miller who is their leading scorer backs it back out with a shot clock windy down launches over Smith too strong that time Rockets trying to get back on the board again the Clippers have out scored now seven straight Rockets still looking put some points on the board Brooks will try the three and it rims down so there you go the Rockets end the drought yeah Rockets fortunate to get that one to go again still not running any sets struggling to get the ball inside and just some of the simple things that Fred Le brings to the table is getting the ball where it should go there's a foul on Brooks as he ended up getting Highland I mean even with Fred Van Vleet the Rockets are next to last in the league actually last in the league officially now an assist percentage as you look at Fred was questionable going into that gold State game with the knee contusion bumped it a little bit in that game as well sitting next to t e is still out in concussion protocol but getting closer to returning F comes into Zubac those two starters are back on the floor now to Dunn on the runner rebound reflected and picked up by Brooks pick up Jalen green coming off this hot first quarter we had 11 gets it back from Sengun put that pivot put down barely and it rolls around and drops for Sengun from the foul line fortunate there again not really getting any offense playing too late to the shot clock so they dump it down to Zubac working on Sengun there's the help from Brooks the skip the touch pass the corner three for Highland how good is he been again the second unit really been impactful pressuring the basketball stepping in confident making shots for Ty 18 points between Miller and Highland Brooks on the Block coming through the lane got foul that'll count he'll tow the line Fern Anand one opportunity he's kind of fired up he's always fired up yes he is and that's hurt bones in his career this side of the flo playing defense see that Dillon Brooks is not going to let you off the hook and scoring the an one a little bit of ol a defense there and shearers From the Bench can imagine what Dillon's saying there Quang oh Dillon got 10 now he'll shoot for 11 here second personal on Highland completes the three-point play rockets back up a half a dozen you can read lips can't you uh I can sometimes a many talents most of the time when you're trying to read somebody's lips is something that you probably repeat in this chair foul oneon-one out High slips by Smith there's the help the wrap around a high and the rockets close out on him was able to create some separation but throws up an air ball and then Sengun got the rebound and then ultimately got fouled great defense from Houston sliding their feet collapsing recovering contesting without fouling that is textbook defense Rockets are smoking the Clippers so far and rebounding not rebounding them 20 to1 so far in this half actually just a shot clock violation Sengun good was not fouled so just a turnover by the Clippers their third the Rockets have committed eight turnovers again that's why threed is so important to this team for all security reasons and that's another turnover on the moving screen which has become a pretty regular think for Sengun picks up the foul the Rockets turn it over the Clippers get the ball back yeah see the frustration from coach Oka but you know he he wants his bigs to set screens and sometimes they're called sometimes they're not the Rockets aren't third in the lead a turnover percentage so they do a great job and they have been in the last season plus the Fred Van Vleet of not turning it over after being played by turnovers for three straight years as Highland gets another one that's his third make from deep and now they got two dudes off their bench at double digits rocket so the Rockets will call another timeout getting sloppy Clippers hanging tough to Miller and Highland carrying the offensive low to the Rockets Le is just three I asked head coach eoka what challenges this Clippers team present despite the fact that they've had to deal with injuries he said well they have dealt with injuries but other guys are stepping up in their absences T-man goes down Kawhi hasn't played this year a lot of guys are taking advantage of those opportunities coach also said they're kind of similar to us at times where different guys step up and contribute on different nights Fred Van Vleet said they are a scrappy team they get out after it Craig and Ryan you're seeing it tonight yeah they're very good defensively oh the Clippers create a lot of H wreak a lot of Havoc defensively ball pressure come up with a lot of steals they've been inconsistent when it comes to their shooting but defensively much like the Rockets they can create problems it's Thompson another offensive rebound nearly turned it over and somehow it finds its way to Jalen green who Miss there another offensive rebound into a cutting Thompson hangs in the air drops it in and got fouled so offensive rebounding You could argue outside of the rocket stingy defense this season has been their greatest strength and it has certainly been a strength for them in the first half of this game Greg that is the Amen Thompson that we are used to seeing hitting the glass cutting using his energy got the start tonight missing his par of twin t not available in concussion protocol but there you go a in Dunn picked up the foul see what he did against the Clippers in that last one both the first game got close in the four fourth quarter because the Clippers third teamers as that's going to be a turnover and a walk on Powell played with so much force and energy they brought the Clippers right back into the game after the Rockets led by as many as 19 as you see on their Academy Sports and Outdoor Super Bowl replay the foul all that and one for aan Thompson the second game against the Clippers was a total blowout in the Rockets favor and ironically in both games Ty punted at the start of the fourth quarter which was surprising and there are the CLI they can force turnovers and they do so there or nearly no they no they yeah they did they called a kick I thought they might call a kick back on the clippers but it will be La basketball T at Mid Court this need to be mindful again we talked about the ball pressure from the Clippers Norman Powell their leading scorer only has five points it's been Miller and Highland who've done the heavy lifting for them they've scored all 18 of the Clippers points in this quarter a piece two and a half to go in this first half first game ever for the Rockets here in this barn Zubac on Tate and you got to make a a a choice you got to be in or you got to be out and never gets out yep defensive three on Sengun called two ning you got to get both feet out you can't go halfway in and halfway out Powell makes the free throw Rockets are six and five on the road this season after for starting last year 5 and 24 they've lost some ground in the standings because of this two game losing streak and the fact that seemingly Dallas and Memphis they don't lose any more at all as Powell got fouled by Tate on a three and he'll go right back to the strike man both the Mavs and The Grizzlies are rolling so Powell back to the line the Rockets are going to the quarterfinals join us at Toyota Center for the cup presented by Kroger this Wednesday December the 11th when the Rockets take on those pesky and hated Golden State Warriors tip off is at secure your tickets right now at

Rockets will hit the road to take on the loser of the other quarterfinal elimination game between Dallas and over the city they need the Rockets faithful to show up for that one me Toyota Center rocking especially against the Warriors yes Jalen Green in air hangs Banks misses but a whistle and a foul we're going to get Zubac with the personal and Jalen green will tow the line for the first time here this evening Zubac wasn't vertical needs to get in in a legal guarding position correct that yes sir there you go there you go I'm proud of you I'm proud of you second on uh Zubac and so green to the line and now a message from relian so the Rockets now six of seven opposite the wall see what Jalen green has done this season in the irony and we talked about this I think it was in Sacramento coming into this season his home road splits his better play was easily in games played to Toyota Center but it's been the opposite this season well this this is a better ball club and Rockets just need his help more on the road and James Green's like I'm ready to play give me the ball terrific help by Tate Porter will step back contested two JT just plays winning basketball man what a luxury to have a guy like that ready to go Jalen green makes his 43 he's got 16 oh man he is ready to rumble here and he's got his old running mate Kevin Porter Jr on the other side short rebound to Tate green circles Baseline finishes with the left hand biggest lead for Houston up by nine and Jalen green continues to pour it on now with 18 points in this first half seven straight for the Rockets missed on the follow by Zubac Houston looking for more and man Thompson back to Brooks little stop at pop three yes that's his third make from Deep he's got 14 and the rockets are rolling 10 straight now there you go thank you Jalen green he got things going and Rockets we're used to seeing F can't finish on Sengun Highland took it away from Green knocked away pinballs back to Highland stolen away from behind by Brooks The Green three on one bounc past Thompson and got fouled there you go and turning the offense get getting the defense going and Dillon Brooks pumped up and Min Thompson running and Jae'Sean Tate man filling in he's he's the substitute ter tonight done C for third and then Thompson to the free throw line a reminder that coming up on the Lexus Halftime Report with Kevin and Calvin they'll uh talk about the um Rockets first half here against the Clippers as well as am man Thompson start here in place of Fred vanle Jae'Sean Tate good minutes to as the Rockets now lead by 13 and he makes him both so he's three for three at the line the Rockets are nine of 10 it's a 120 Houston run up by 14 we'll get the ball back to close it out here strong close for the Rockets needless to say here in this second quarter Powell to Zubac double team turned over but unfortunately fouled JT has been everywhere here good energy man and a stingy Defender man Scrappy Junkyard Dog mentality and man his impact has been on this ball game but again man I'm telling you you see JT on the road at home he's getting his extra running in his conditioning and you see it he's getting on the FL ready to go he's not out of shape how off the pick drives the lane switches to the left short rebound poked out of bounds by Dillon Brooks good job there from Al going vertical keeping his hands straight up and down not fouling that is the biggest difference in his ball game we've seen this season all right so the Clippers with the shot clock off to take the final shot now after all that transpire they coming to Kevin Porter Jr working on Tate comes through the lane contested Runner short followed home and that should could count Ivica Zubac at the horn to end the Rockets 120 run they're late in that second quarter but Houston does lead by 12 here at halftime 6452 as they try to get back into the wind column and snap their first losing streak of this season and that basket indeed will count on the follow for Zubac and Rockets assistant coach Royal Ivy is now with Vanessa Richardson coach these are two Scrappy defensive minded teams what do you want to see from your guys in the second half got a break it keep on bringing it the first 5 minutes was great we were into them we pressured the ball we shared the ball and the the intensity is great right now so we got to keep it going in the second half how would you assess A Min Thompson start tonight men Thompson he's our Energizer bunny I'm looking for a triple double he's got five assists and I think three rebounds eight points so he does a little bit of everything and the defensive intensity is great so kudos to Amen Thompson thank you coach thank you Rockets fans make sure you stay tuned for Rockets halftime coming your way with Kevin ashenfelder and the Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy play presented by HB an awesome first half by Jalen green leads everybody in scoring with 18 this part of that 12-2 Rockets run over the last two and change but close out the second quarter Dillon Brooks had 14 and the half played some great defense sparking his team and this is what the Rockets are missing in their most recent two losses in Sacramento and then again in San Francisco welcome back inside of the brand new int Dome here in Englewood California I'm Craig he's Ryan and that was more like it especially the last couple of minutes of that first half of the Houston Rockets yeah the Rockets brought the energy thank you Jalen green man he started hitting shots feeling comfortable he's been unbelievable on the road and then the Rockets hitting the glass playing with high energy and again we talked about the big key of the game what Craig keep the pace up that was an excellent way to finish and need more in the second half yeah you talk about the rebounding numbers the Rockets all over the glass out rebounding the Clippers by 11 they're shooting 57% the Clippers at 43 the wall did not affect the rockets at all at the foul line they were nine of 10 a lot of turnovers though 10 of them they need to reduce those and the rockets look a lot of Second Chance points 12 of them in the half a plus eight in terms of second chance points against the Clippers and the rockets only had six offensive re so they pretty much scored after every single offensive Rebound in that first half remember they're the best offensive rebounding team in the league and the Clippers are the best defensive rebounding team in the league but the one thing that the Rockets have not done a good job of which is what I just mentioned and unfortunately what we just saw in their first possession to start this second half which was a turn over their 11 so right here we see Ty LS taking a book at out of eeme oka's book and Batum is the one and not Zubac guarding Sengun Batum starting remember they they lost air coffee in pregame warm-ups and they lost Derrick Jones Jr in the first half in addition to no moamba and no James Harden look at just bumping and checking and no Cai letter there you go man is also out for them but a fractured finger is Amen Thompson knocks down to three that's how you answer the disrespect and Zach guarding Amen Thompson KJ working around the screen got away some fil looks look like he got away with some contact Dunn goes Baseline but can't score done questioning his jump shot there and Kevin Porter Jr strips it away from Thompson races the other way and then gets pushed from behind so that's his first but that was the Rocket's 12th turnover and again that number is very high and tends to be higher when Fred Van Vleet does not play as is the case here sure they're going to look for a clear path here or yep that's what they're looking at right going to double check to see if that met the criteria for a clear path area the uh the ramps beat the bills this Arena was it Sofi stadium in the same vicinity so a lot of traic a lot of activity in the area here today rebound Tosi ped away from behind by Dunn Powell misses the three he's been very quiet oh four down from long range this new facility is about five blocks away from the form where the Lakers used to play and then three blocks away from Sofi Stadium where the Rams play so a lot of activity and the Lakers of course are playing tonight as well but they're downtown Clippers trying to get back into this game with ball pressure and here here's the thing J has to go out and post up Batum he's got his hands all over him from the perimeter finally a timeout call before it was a foul so e steps onto the court stops action calls the timeout will step aside as well it's 6750 of the game represented by MD Anderson Jalen Green's been on fire still leads everybody at the gym and scoring it is four of eight from downtown down so far Greg the one thing you love about Jalen tonight is zero hesitation when he gets the ball he's been aggressive letting the ball fly and the ball mement has been there when the ball pressure hasn't frustrated the Rockets but how good has he been man 18 points in the half and might have a shot at another 40 ball why not Craig why not got to get a little hot I think to get there but so far he's been terrific and they needed this performance from him without Fred Van Vleet and of course Jalen here recently has kind of ridden the the roller coaster 41 single digits 28 and then struggled with his shot at the Warriors as did most of the Rockets where he had 14 points however as a men Thompson scores again however when the Rockets got off to that terrible start the end did and was kind of the Catalyst for the Rockets initially to get back in that game Thompson now with 14 five in the quarter for a men K PJ and he knocks it down from the free throw line one decent game against the rockets in Houston one awful game for him against the rockets in Houston and then tosson wide open airballs that he's he's been the Rockets percentage wise been the Rockets best quarter three-point shooting but those things above the break is completely different animal Aaron holiday has actually been the Rocket's best and most consistent three-point threat even though his minutes and shots and usage has been rather low this season as jaar's called for a foul there on Zubac I'm telling you right now tyou is is doing he's giving e a t Taste of his own medicine saying okay in Thompson take all the shots you want and hats off to Amen he has made him pay and that's something the Rockets did to Kris Dunn and still doing it to a b to a degree in this ball game a men so far is perfect from two he has hit a three as Powell finally gets his first triple to go down he was over for four going into that shot making again Sengun's catches are so far away from the rim t for him to do something with it out there as Jalen green the line his contested Jay is Off the Mark and Kevin Porter Jr with the rebound the momentum here with the Clippers rockets need to get a solid possession to slow things down green back to Sengun red and knocked Away by Dunn who gets it back really good defensive play there by Kris Dunn so far the game started good as far as turnovers but really enhanced towards the end of the second quarter and second half Here Comes Jalen green clipped and fouled and he'll tow the line here try to end another 70 Clippers run here in this game Jalen had ill in intentions off that split and so Jalen to the line after the foul on Nick Batum take advantage of tonight's rocket shop online item of the game our new era 920 draft cap is only 18 bucks shot Now Rocket Shop so he's looking for a looking for a 20 ball here 20 piece for the game see the Rockets turnover issues coming in Sixth and turnovers per game third and turnover rate so well above that without Fred Van Vleet as green does have a 20 piece for the game Rockets continue to get the Clippers at arms length their biggest lead has been 14 rebound to Dillon Brooks flippers are eight of 23 from the distance the Rockets 10 of 24 from 20 at the top foul Circle and Dillon Brooks now with 16 points he's made the most of his shots here in this game six of nine from the field Brook screaming over to the LA Ben saying no no no I'm not the one for Zu to guard either Kevin Porter Jr. on the Move missed it in inside position on the rebound Jabari get ripped it away from OTS and then gets fouled as he brings it across home man rebound kids at home you hear that grab it with two hands get your elbows out chin the basketball great job there from Jabari done picked up with the foul his fourth stun amongst the league leaders and Steals and also leads the Clippers in deflection when you play against pressure you have to be really tight with the basketball set better screen your back doors will be there but amongst all be strong with the ball done to the line to the Lane one on Three got sandwiched and fouled pass off foul such a physical B trist really uses his shoulders to get downhill soari with his third the Rockets fourth 652 to go in the third and our first visit here the finale of this three-game road trip in California the Rockets losers on the first two legs of this trip for the Kings and the Warriors trying to bounce back here this this evening can't get off the three Jabari is able to track him down Porter spinning on Brooks HEI hesi D score that's off the Kevin Porter Jr there didn't play around with the basketball and just got downhill so his first start start this season with the flippers his first start at the NBA level since April of 2023 when he was still with the Rockets as Brooks and Porter going at it off the ball and Porter's call for the foul his first got a little too handsy underneath with Dillon Brooks easy call for the officials look at Dillon Brooks here man there's no way Zubac has guard me nice little step back talking with the bench no no no coach Ty I'm not the one 13 foul on the Clippers butum continuing to harass Sengun way away from the rim spin by him there's the help by Zubac finds Brooks he com in the lane he misses and the rebound picked back up by Brooks to Green for three nope too strong another offensive rebound back to a cutting Green Look Out Below Jalen green stuffs it down fiveing his boys in the front crowd man first open look Jam had it a half court dunk in a wow he's just been getting tackled that's a doz it now for Zubac Sengun this time not picked up on the perimeter goes to work unfortunately misses and that's spread and stolen by Jalen green now finds Sengun and he's able to gallop to the iron it does not go down but he ultimately got fouled that's number five on Dunn and Sengun will shoot two that fist number near fish there for Alperen like the rockets in transition but this is nice right here Alperen working the glass cutting Jalen green no helping goodness dude he flyed through the air on that one one more coming for Sengun there it goes that's fun there energy High fiveing his partner in the crowd and man you see the whole Clippers looking over they say man there's nobody can do there I don't know who that guy was but when you look at him quickly it kind of looked like Garrison Matthews a little bit no that's not jarrison Matthews dude kind of sort of looked like him maybe I miss really okay the into a don't we are really high we are really high cig needs glasses but car no good halfway down tough look for Zubac I'm not saying that he's here I'm just saying the guy kind to look like him a little bit blocked by Zubac picked up by Thompson and finishes over the top of Miller offensive rebounds for the Rockets we talked about that being a big key and paying off in the last two possessions better energy from Houston Porter spins Rockets defend but somehow he's able to work his way through two lockly three Defenders for the banked in shots inexcusable no way he scores over three rockets right there green splits a double team comes to the lane on the other side oh how about that little acrobatic razzled Dazzle circus shot on the other side for Jalen green putting on a show he starts heating up man it's could be a problem for La already has been zuo box the reverse Spin and score and that just got to stay between Zubac and the rim make him score over you he's capable but too easy they got to call that bump too it's too handsy for patum that leaves Jabari wide open little high low Flash action calmly knocks it down timeout Clippers Rockets up 12 359 to go in the third for of the five rocket starters they in double figures led by Jalen green look at the split of the double team then the circus make on the other side 24 for Jalen green again in a game the Rockets needed the offenseive rebound high in the air and down hard with it Ryan Hollis this is a pretty look here Alperen with their offensive rebound throwing it to Jalen man and there is nothing that the Clippers are going to do it that one little frustration on the rim High fiveing his boy getting the energy here in the building for the Rockets riding that scoring roller coaster and right now he's on the upward trajectory pass and crash Jan Tate who's the best at on the Rockets roster of taking charges just haven't seen much of it cuz he doesn't play a whole lot took one there has unbelievable man and I'm I'm telling you from this guy's diet to his workouts to his commitment he's in the gym early and everybody's you know tired and arested man JT is getting his work in and you know normally you'd see conditioning be a problem or a little hesitancy man and JT has not missed the beat putting guys in the right spots knows where to be he's a coach on the floor but man what what a luxury has to come back and help Jalen so an inbound the ball green got right by Powell got pushed on his way into the lane and we'll go back to the line here number 24 first on Powell more freebies here for Jalen green there been delay of game against the Clippers delay of game warning on the Clippers and now this word from more he stays perfect at the line roets have been very good they're not even shooting towards the wall in this half green six with six Adams in for Sengun and Powell takes it to him Steven doesn't have the same foot speed but nonetheless still a very physical presence you go t draws the foul on Bon Highland and he wants tyo to call the timeout and challeng this he can't believe it Highland realized who he was getting posted up by see Jeff Van Gundy there and Jason pal assistant head trainer there and Tylo saying what challenge him they're like no no no no Bryant Shaw and even with all those Clippers current dignatories you might be the most popular person in the building here tonight too kind too kind Craig they love you here man good times here in La this is home for me very familiar with the Clipper organization Zubac shooting seven of 12 helps keep him behind you in terms of the all-time true shooting percentage record holder for in Clippers franchise history cheering pretty hard for those for those misses I mean when I think of flippers basketball I think I think of you and ly Mo oh goodness fou oh man no rebound Tate Tate's had a very good allaround game he's been all over the place Man flying around he looks faster Thompson on Miller there you go and he's just pretty much Unstoppable when he gets the ball moving downhill like that into the pain well what you're saying is there's no way you don't have somebody guard me and I'm going to make you paying and Amen Thompson has done that several times here tonight Highland the Porter and he makes it from the corner his second three he's got 14 now Jalen green off the pick open look at the three missed that halfway down and then taken back by amen Thompson back to green working off Porter stepping back top three into corner and bounces off and they that hit the top of the back cour I think was there a foul was Adams I think they're called foul I think Kai Jones was holding Steven Adams Kai Jones yeah that was that that that is the call yeah Kai can fly but there's not much he's going to do with Sten Adams yeah he's got the Hops doesn't have the wit no no that's a that's a tough one so Steven Adams to the line here for the first time a couple of points in this game I I do want to chime in and say if we did a this edition of welcome to this edition of Ryan's friends today would have been one of the best episodes would have the best we walked in this is a new dome and yet everybody knew who he was it was sweet like the

missed his free but he's two for two from the field Here Comes Porter tow no rebound tipped Adams can he save it oh look out went diving head first over there just outside of the basket ston just leaving it all on the line Steven Adams you know we were in San Francisco there was a 7.0 earthquake the other day by the way I never felt it that registered 5.2 on the rer scale the did you feel that earthquake when we were in the Bay Area I did not neither did I my phone got a tsunami watch alert so did mine I didn't think anything of it and all of a sudden it was like there was an earthquake I

rebounding the Clippers by 17 they lead La a plus 12 in terms of Second Chance points that just so happens to be your scoring margin through three of man Thompson's got a season out 26 and four dim Jalen green sitting on 26 in a 16 spot for Dillon Brooks those are the guys who are the Rocket's top three scorers so far Jae'Sean Tate unbeliev yeah he's been very very good Sheppard chasing quarter and makes it Rockets hit the Clippers with that 12-2 run to close out in the second quarter margin this game is pretty much been about the same ever since as Tate rolls to the Lane and when he gets to his left hand that's what he wants to do coming through the lane and it is kind of tough to stop what a night for him going for a ride right there not much he can do missed that shot rebound cleared by Sengun he's got eight of those six dimes 11 points sheer from Tate didn't hesitate missed the shot though that's his second Miss of the game over two from the three-point line alp's been really quiet since baton switched over Zubac picks up Jones don't forget rockets and warriors Wednesday night elimination game for the NBA cup pregame start thereabouts tip right here on Space City home network join us if you can't come to the game Miller loses Sheppard drives the lane misses the shot fate there with the rim protection holiday of eight quarter to sheeper back on the reset to Jabari

to the game and a rockets red Alpine hat get your tickets now at rockets.com the quarter been pretty good this half and looking to make things happen no James Harden available got the start tonight's going to have some juice playing against the Rockets former teammates on the floor still two on shun again there's the help flying around on defense Smith Goes Baseline missed the punch but got fouled that's one thing the last couple games we've been seeing from Jabari is him not settling for that midrange but going all the way to the rim nice if he ends up throwing that one down see what goes on here and gets yeah good slap there from the tomb so good call from the officials another make for the rockets at the line Jabari now with another double double is fourth this season is second in as many games against the Clippers misses that one Rockets have been excellent so far tonight at the line Clippers only shot eight bre thr 24 and Highland gets denied But ultimately gets fouled so he'll go to the free throw line similar these clipper guards without James James Harden on the for Bowes Highland and Kevin Porter they're saying hey man give us the opportunity to play and been aggressive with the basketball yeah James is having the worst shooting season of his career but it's still their engine Harden's only shooting 38% from the floor and 34 3point L almost 10 percentage points lower for James Harden this season from two than what he's put up in his career from two know when James Harden came here don't know if he envisioned that he'd be the only star so-called left Paul George going kaai available kaai still hurt but again Kawhi Leonard expected back before Christmas he is ramping up his workouts although he has missed like 30% of his gamees signing his hometown Clippers Smith falls down regains his balance finds a wide open Aaron holiday and he knocks it down so he's a 40er and he started 0 of three from three he's made his last two and guess what he's shooting 40% from three in this game now two of five sure what the Clippers were doing there just a blown assignment of all people you leave Aaron Holiday Open it's 11 of 31 from three foul line Jimmy two strong rebound and unfortunately Jabari just kicked it over to Ben Sullivan though man Jabari chases down every single rebound on both ends Dillon Brooks coming in tapate going out really really good game for Jae'Sean Tate yeah for a guy who hadn't played you know meaningful minutes in a while I think when he got in the first half was the first time he's been in the first half of the game all year and here's the thing for dooka you know he's going to watch these minutes and Stu by Sengun pinball back off of Zubac continue to get opportunities good job there Walling up on Zubac again like I said earlier C make Zubac score over you not that he can't but those are much harder shots every Zubac Miss there's a little smile from Ryan Holland that the cheek color fan W Pi him score over you be tough hold your ground sheer from three Porter spinning now to pillar had SC since that great first half and that's an easy two for him got to step up and help he been do anything there ball now for Miller holiday to Sheppard to Brooks for three fighting for the board is Jabari Smith Jr the kick out the holiday and he tickles the twine there's talked about Jabari hitting the glass on both ends how good has he been not just this game but this season he has rebounded the ball exceptionally well against the Clippers this season quter with Brooks on his hip pocket and there's a foul that's going to be called that's going to be Dillon's third defin the best game against the rockets for Kevin Porter Jr but look at this man Jabari comes from the other side gets that and those are the best three-pointers you can get is off of offensive rebounds and Aaron holiday lines it up look like Jrue holiday tonight man got the hairo with his brother got the headband going little little bit of a different look for him on this trip Miller off Zubac pick halfway down Powell out stays with it misses back to Sengun will pick and pop for three he's over two from the three-point line high and that bounces down front rim it eventually dropped bones has a street ball game man got a lot of handles and moves didn't go so well for him in Denver but he has found Rejuvenation here this season with clippers Brooks think he trying to get it back he threw that one up hard bones again roxs the Cradle shoots misses this time oh was five of eight deep and he is shooting a career ey of three this year this is second game in a row the has made five threes thomps will turn off for the free throw line and kind of look like a Rodney McCrae free throw line drive Amen Thompson now at 22 Clippers call another timeout with the Rockets now leading 106 to 93 Aaron holiday getting some good run here and doing what he does which is make threes three of them in fact was asked what stands out about Houston and he said their defensive mindset he said eeme Oka has put his stamp on this team they are tough-nosed they compete every night said he did the same thing in Boston they play hard and complete defensively every game e in Brooks Thompson he said they just make it really tough on pretty much every team and they're extremely aggressive drag and Ryan oh thank you vessa and thank you tyo because yes the Rockets are extremely aggressive although we have a see I'm not sure why Pal's T did you see what happened I'm sure we'll find out very soon and I played for tyo he ran the defense under dock in both places in LA and oh Dillon Brooks got teed up in Boston and Dillon said something that Craig you probably read those lips couldn't tell what well if I would have read the lips I would have known he got teed up tyou yeah very defensive mind and always been that way how Works Baseline misses everything see the Speedy lineup with Jabari at Center and Jalen just got fouled by Bones the challenge is who Zubac going to guard looks like he's going to attempt to check him in Thompson and it's something we've seen used by coach Oka a lot more and Jalen green back to the line fourth on Bones Highland give the gift of Rockets basketball this season Rockets holiday packs you can choose some our Fred and green plan or holiday plan starting just 99 bucks each plan comes with a five Rockets game plus a Christmas Vacation themed clutch figurine don't wait get yours now at rockets.com De Rockets back home on Wednesday taking on the Warriors in that elimination game the NBA cup quarterfinals covered starting at how raising up Ton green goes high for his third rebound Rockets are almost out rebound the Clippers by 20 he'll pull back isot ahead of steam to Paton back to Green Hope these teams have had their issu shooting threes this season although the cers do have plenty of guys who half shot it well but overall they' slipped here as of late they were hot when they were in Houston but they slipped here a little bit as of late middle of the pack of the Clippers and it comes to effective field goal percentage Zubac gets it a little high over the top pass for two giving him an angle he's too huge and Dillon Brooks couldn't get back around another double double for Zubac Zing a double double will pull back three over Zu short can't can complacent here plenty of time left how draws a crowd find Zubac for the flush it's only a 10-point game and am is kind of feeling what I'm feeling right now again you can't get complacent still a lot of basketball left to be played in a 10-point lead with four minutes to go is just not big enough places and by the season to give presented by Macy's 10898 Houston 422 to go rockets taking on the clippers for the third time this season trying to make it 3 and0 against the Clippers and the rockets have gone cold they've missed three straight shots five of their last six some momentum for La a timeout for eay and hopefully the Rockets with some momentum grabbing possessions here coming out of this timeout go back out on the floor Rockets are rocking with their starting line tonight again no Fred Van Vleet EV Thompson starting for him again has he's done as a starter he's excelled Brooks for three Brooks for three four yeah Clippers really over rotated on that possession excellent job by the Rockets moving the basketball taking advantage and D Brooks paying off the ball movement again over the top to Zubac and he got hacked by Jabari Smith Jr why the Rockets keep letting Zubac getting behind them to stay in front rot him out so Jabari with the foul Zubac to the line and now a word from mattress F oh your how do you sleep at night on the match is for my this FM so 52 per Center and he vits a Zubac makes the first his first free throw of the game only the Clipper is 12 he's got one more to come so since he's basically been a 50/50 proposition since he made the first well we'll see what happens two for two rockets trying to get back of the wind column and the Clippers their second straight home loss Smith no but there was a foul on Powell that was on the pass off and Norman is charging through the screen using too much hands played on that team with Fred won a World Championship over in Toronto green slithering freed himself up missed the Jay and Sengun was fouled going for the rebound but 321 to go you got Kevin Porter trying to guard Alperen down low with Zubac roaming you got to feed Sengun somehow get him the basketball that's inexcusable but good job though from Alperen hit the glass you know if the ball doesn't come to you don't stop playing and Coach Oka trying to get guys the right spot back to shin and off the glass bit of an awkward angle Miller do Zubac to score the last six for off his fingertips to Bones Highland a collision and a block they're going to count the hope at and one coming up for bones Highland Sengun can't believe it wants his coaches to take a look at it and challenge it they can because they won their challenge earlier in the game and they will indeed call a timeout and challenges Sengun was convinced he was in a legal guarding position and outside of of the restricted area and we'll see what they decide when we come back yep nine-point Rockets lead 259 to go that last play that they ultimately called a block and one for bones Highlands question is are these feet outside of the restricted I think they are gets that kill up over the line question is was there any Movement by him in to Highland after review The Defender sanon was not in his half prior to his upward shooting motion therefore is a blocking foul we have one shot for bones highler yeah IP was he was still moving that's where the call is look at him he wasn't there he's still sliding in yeah it slid into his path but again we've seen that same play be called a charge also well straight line straight line pathway plays have been a point of emphasis this season in the league it's about who's creating contact and if the defender takes the driver off his line and that's what they ultimately felt that Sengun took Highland off his line which he's entitled to when the Rockets going and watch film Alperen slide over go vertical and block or contest that shot and he doesn't score no need for him to be taking charges especially if he's out of position and look Kevin Porter Jr guarding Sengun 22 now for bones Highland a season High into Smith to dig the shot the Miss Powell out Jabari a gge porter but Zub box there to swat it away Clipper still very much alive Bones from the wing good pass though from changon you got to get him the ball earlier and then watch the Clippers collapse sh go falls down it's loose green Dives and had it knocked out of bounds Rockets fortunate to have it but look at the shot clock there's only four and a half remaining on this position for the Rockets who are aren't exactly closing this game out with a ton of confidence here yeah very shaky and Rocket taking too long to get into their set so now they got to get it and go into green up top comes around the pick shot clock winding down off balance he and he got it to go just a
