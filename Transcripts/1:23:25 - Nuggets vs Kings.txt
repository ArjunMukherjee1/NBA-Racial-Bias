 starting to look like that championship team from a couple of seasons ago when they won the Larry O'Brien trophy Nikola Jokic folks anytime that he's on the court the Nuggets are going to have an opportunity to go all the way and he's got consecutive triple doubles and he's sat out a lot of the fourth quarters lately yeah four straight triple doubles and yeah you're right in all four of those he did not play in the fourth quarter that's how well this team has been playing but when you look at it you know he's a guy that likes to get his points in the paint Point defense is going to be very important second in the league behind Giannis in points for him but his three-point shooting is spectacular this year and he's he's shooting a much higher volume so you got to defend him everywhere to think that he's got three MVPs and right now he might be enjoying his best statistical season ever we'll be back with just a moment with the opening tip that Sacramento Kings ready to squabble up Fox and Company still rolling like a Grand National into the mile high city back with more in just a moment 5280 ft that's the elevation an equal expectation tonight for the Sacramento Kings as they continue on this red hot tear right now winning 10 of their last 12 games on a three-game winning streak as they take on the Denver Nuggets another fast rising Squad right now in the Western Conference at 27 and6 Sacramento trying to close in on that six spot in the Western Conference just a game out behind the Clippers let's take a look at the starting line lups tonight monin fox in the back court remember Keegan Murray missed the first game between these two teams meanwhile Murray and Braun in the back court Jokic Westbrook and Porter also rounding out the starting five for the Denver Nuggets Aaron Gordon coming off the bench as you look at that nuggets starting five the head coach for Denver Michael Malone guided them to their Championship a couple of seasons ago now in his 10th season on the sidelines his Squad getting healthier and in the process becoming much more lethal as well meanwhile Doug Christie since taking the rign of this team has gone 10 and two and right now has this team believing that as you heard my partner say a little bit earlier tonight represents an opportunity and not an obstacle Katie what are your keys to the game as we move forward here well when you face this nuggets team you have to have your paint defense on point you got to pack in that paint they do a good job shooting from the the outside but the lowest volume three-point shooting team in the league second one I think the battle on the bench is going to be critical tonight neither bench is good that's the reason why he's at the free throw line right now and he goes 0 for two successful challenge so the Kings retain their challenge um but surprised cuz I didn't feel like there was really any legitimate contact on that off the deflection a turnover good defensive activity that time by Russell Westbrook Aaron Gordon on the drive out to Jokic and that's the reason why he one of the top three-point shooting players in the league shooting 47.5% coming into tonight last year he made 83 triples that was his 77th of the Season we're at the Midway point so it's a much bigger piece of his offensive pie this year as well Westbrook leading the team with the fastest Pace in the NBA Aaron Gordon going to walk down Keon Ellis tipped it a couple of times and the Kings got away with one there they got numbers four on two Malik Monk and there you heard it and one Malik made his own call and he'll go to the free throw line for a couple of shots but great transition running there and consistent right this is what they need to do they need to make sure whether it's a make or a miss that they're really pushing it you're going to hear it right here the comment just talking about that the commentary from Malik monk is my favorite on the basket Monk oh yeah we need to get him miked up for a full game at some point got to get somebody on the listen listen he and Jokic are having a nice conversation I think Jokic just said but I thought you were going to make the shot so I was going to go against Devin Carter and they're looking right now to attack Devin Carter obviously when a rookie comes out on the floor veterans will try to single them out on the defensive end and that is exactly how they're supposed to be guarding uh Russell Westbrook to start the game from Beyond The Arc uh Keegan or Keon Ellis as you see getting all the way to the rim but just keep an eye on that matchup because you can tell that that Russell is looking to single out Devin Carter and make him have to defend him one-on-one hey xinity gives fans the mest connection to the King stream the biggest moments from the best seat in the house Xfinity bring on the good stuff monk will come out of the ball game Trey ly on the floor for Sacramento with Keegan Murray Domantas sabonis Ellis and Carter in the back court De'Aaron FOX also ready to come back in KD how does Sacramento get Fox going a little bit offensively when going to the ground having a conversation with the officials right now Doug Christie out there getting things straight with the officiating crew sea Wright and Doug having a spirited conversation back after this five Mark Jones court side along with Katie Christensen Beam Team beginning a six-game road trip the roseen check back in WoW Russell Westbrook oh he can get up you have to be Courtside to appreciate his boun Gordon kept it in Play Jokic One More Str made the last one this one comes off and Sacramento sub bonis brings it across Rosen working against Aaron Gordon Aaron Gordon guarding D Rose and Gordon on a minute's restriction still Fox from 18 got it that's two for two for De'Aaron fox and felt like he got fouled as well but that's how you get them involved right they were very selected make sure they got it back to the top so you could do a little Twan action between domos and De'Aaron and that was an easy pick and roll get straight to the mid on the pick and pop yo Jokic underneath to Str whistle foul counted J and an n one for Julian Str want to take a look back at that screen on Devin Carter by Jokic um this was the buck you were talking about the three and yeah I mean there's a there's an argument there that that is an absolute moving screen and he's going to talk to the officials he's going to have the conversation he's talked about it so much this season he wants the guys to let him have the conversations and them just worry about it but listen that's a big screen so if it's uh on the illegal side that it leaves an impact trying to go around a behemoth of a man there six-point lead largest of the ball game for Denver Lyles slips out Ellis guarded by Watson good ball Movement by the Kings Derozan got caught up in the air but it's going to be a foul against Aaron Gordon might have gotten pushed wow talk about just having a feel for the game going to pass the ball and goes up into the shot that is just a heads up play by Demar Derozan Savvy Ki knowledgeable veteran will go to the free throw line

shopping spree 10 winners will be selected with prizes ranging from $100 to $500 visit kings.com newear to enter the sweep Stakes end on January 31st good luck bunch of Sacramento Kings fans in attendance tonight Rosen a perfect three for three from the strike nine at the break and Keon Ellis hoping to give Sacramento a nice Lift Off the Bench he's got one bucket in the ball game and working a little magic in the open court with that dime to L back with the second quarter in the moment brought to you by Toyota the other way to Denver what do you make of the fact that the kings are 10 and eight on the road well I think it's just happen stance based on kind of how the schedule was and when their struggles uh started they had that five-game losing streak at home you know before there was a a change made at the the coaching position and I think that that has a a big play in terms of the Home Road you know record overall go Kevin herder checking into the ball game during the break Derozan going to work on Watson herder open for three Murray with another offensive rebound that's a big change from a night ago Watson with a nice rear viw contest and block and that's going to be a foul on herder oo Kevin got a little little extra ump on that one right there but made sure that it wasn't a three-point opportunity hey at the other end though Katie what about the offensive rebound by Keegan Murray Sacramento didn't have many at all last night as we see what happened at the other end with Kevin it's certainly something that um has been a strength of this team and it was a glaring difference last night I didn't feel like they were consistently going to the offensive blast and it was discussed today uh during the team film and and walkth through about making sure that they're they're focusing on that and really the most you know from a guard position and anybody not named Damonte sabonis the most consistent guy all season long has been Keegan Murray and he's been very active tonight been fantastic on those tapouts on the offensive glass Watson knocks down the second the lead up to 10 for the Nuggets Denver 13 and8 at home this year at ball Arena they run a little angle pop angle pick and roll Trey Lyles can't find the mark and this is when Jokic is not in the game I mean it's really important for the Kings to try and put together a run get some stops and see if you can't cut into this this lead for Denver Fox got a hand up but it didn't matter Jamal Murray is locked in laser focused tonight the lead is up to 13 Derozan going to work on Str and Demar Derozan tell you what he's like Novae he'll take the pain away he's he's just so good and you when you watch him up close and how he reads the defense and how he scans the floor and the decision the the moment he makes his decision on what move move he is just so spoton with his decision making anytime you need to stop the hemorrhaging Derozan in the half court is great medicine he's three for three from the foul line tonight he leads all Sacramento scores with nine points so it's herder fox in the back Court Murray Lyles and Derozan on the front line a good time for Sacramento to take advantage of those cost of the official so it'll come back Sacramento with a chance to get it back to within 10 dou Christie directing traffic making the call in the sidelines High horns action going to let Demar get into that pain and Michael Porter Jr looked like he was frisking De’Aaron at TSA security lot of hands Keegan Murray left it short Strather drives it good Hustle by Trey lyes got to the deck first and he calls timeout after retrieving the loose ball we're going to take a timeout as well with 955 to go in the first half Kings down by 12 when we return to ball Arena welcome back everyone to Denver hey Kings basketball in NBC Sports California is brought to you by the Apex at Red Hawk Resort in Casino taking family fund to a whole new level speaking of its levels to this folks Daren fox has been extremely impactful even though he hasn't been scoring the ball that well of late look at these numbers a plus one plus 24 and a plus 10 including a 13 assist game yeah against Washington ktie yeah I I mean he's he's definitely you know draws attention from defenses right and he draws double teams he draws guys that have to come and stop his verbal penetration and he really uh knocked by Watson he recollects it is able to get the little soft floater over DeAndre Jordan there and here's one thing I know about uh Keegan Murray he's unflappable not a lot of things affect him unless he's at a rod wave concert he'll get a little Rowdy there's a yeah there's look at De'Aaron Fox and his left two fingers including the index and ring finger taped together folks I saw a shot of that the other day without it taped up the index finger reminds me of a long windy Country Road in Suburban Florida I mean that thing makes a right turn where it's not supposed to the fact that De'Aaron is handling the ball as well as he is and shooting the ball as well as is this year is a testament to the work that he's put in well in the wild part part is that you know you look at it he has been struggling with the digits on that the you know dominant hand all season long that has not been a nonissue from the start inside Porter junr on the putback yeah fox has admitted that he's going to have to do something and get that fixed at the end of the season middle of may end of June middle of June sometime pocket bass never made it Murray picked it off Jamal Murray in transition from Kitchener Ontario Canada that one a little bit strong sabonis in the Cross Match on Murray good contest by Domantas but another opportunity boy Jordan with the slam a wonderful delivery so this is what I was talking about earlier with the cross matches right you're never able to nuggets frankly a little bit more aggressive on the offensive glass right now they've gotten several second opportunities and a lot of it is the Kings being undersized and you can't use that as an excuse you got to get a body in somebody you can't try to out jump them and Michael Porter Jr he's 6'1 you know Keon Ellis is 6' five you got to do something a little extra to to keep him off the glass the after mentioned Michael Porter Jr at the free throw line and now a quick word from the Roseville Auto Mall there's only one place where you'll find thousands of top brand Vehicles 17 dealers and a friendly staff find the perfect ride tailored to fit your budget shop the largest selection of vehicles during the certified pre-owned sale at the Roseville Auto Mall driven to be the best Porter junr knocks down the second lead up to 16 as we approach the Midway and that's going to put him at the free throw line for a couple of sh shot pton Watson vehemently protesting to no avail he's in his 17th season and his in athletic ability has always been a strength but generally that dissipates over the years and it it doesn't really seem to have done that at all for Russell Westbrook still super fast can leap out of the gym there's a reason why Nikola Jokic lobbied the front office very passionately to sign Russell Westbrook and it has been been one of the great stories in the NBA this year in the fit that he's been for the Denver Nuggets monk H the free throw line because we know that it doesn't always work out when players feel yeah that someone should be yep Russ will bring it across working against Keon Ellis puts his head down and we're going to have a foul against Ellis yeah Russ going right at yeah Keon right now he is attacking the the paint trying to really put his head down and get going and and yeah I mean I think that Keon has a really great argument right protest that to go and the frustration level is high right now for the Kings and it sounds like there's going to be a timeout but De'Aaron Fox he's getting hit going to the basket doesn't feel like he's getting the calls you just got to keep plugging away you cannot let the circum affect your effort 256 to go in the first half got a Time on on the floor we'll be right back after we pay some bills Len Mark Jones Courtside along with Katie Christensen time now for our wing stop bringing the flavor a look at some of the seemingly at the time insurmountable deficits that Sacramento has come back to win games in under interim head coach Doug Christie 18 17 18o deficits so Katie what that you have a Miss uh at The Rim on one end it's going to be a bucket for the other team on the other end it is a a 11-22 from the field at in in the paint for the Kings and that is not not a number you want to see got a whistle in a foul against Denver that foul will go against Jokic looks like we're going to have a timeout and a subsequent challenge to the foul on the floor on Jokic with 154 to go here in the opening half we're going to stay right here the rul on the floor is being challenged that foul call they had that arm extended it's in what they call by rule a non-legal guarding position so here's the here's the question is how is it going to be interpreted on who did the hook first Jokic doesn't feel like it was him trying to be as unbiased as possible and knowing how post players minds work to me it looked like he initiated that hook but the interesting thing is how are the officials going to view it players have become so Adept and Adroid at tricking and gaming see right there as he goes he puts his his hand through and then he lifts his elbow on purpose and that's when Malik monk looks like he's grabbed him see he didn't have contact when he had his arm back Malik monk didn't it and as soon as as Jokic saw it he wraps up and then lifts That Elbow to try and make it seem like yes there's definitely some enhancement there I mean my favorite part of the whole play if I'm being honest is watching Malik talk trash after it all happened he does not mess around there is not a a person that he's ever going to go up against that he is going to back down from Fearless 154 to go waiting for this call to be adjudicated here's the call the ruler on the floor is an unsuccessful challenge as the defender grabs the offensive player's arm as he is advancing toward the basket they would no longer retain their right to challenge we put the ball out free throw line extended we shooting two right now we shooting two we're in the penalty sorry we're shooting two shots all right so it is in un sucessful chall unsuccessful and it's going to be Malik monk at the free throw line so I like that Denver doesn't have any more challenges anytime Jokic's got his palms up to the sky he usually fou the guy as a general rule around the league Malik monk at the foul line for the Sacramento Kings down by 22 at 5280 FT elevation there is no good way to acclimate to Mile High in such a short period of time especially when you are sleep deprived the team got in at about last night got to the hotel most players put it down around a.m. I'm not going to say there are a few zombies out there but summoning a lot of energy here they're all professionals you can definitely say that that Denver has to have the best homec court advantage in the in the league at some point there was a crazy stat I forget what it was might have been 56 And1 56 and two against teams going from the Pacific time zone playing a backto back in the Mountain Time Zone here against Denver almost to the point of being a competitive disadvantage for the opponent as Michael Porter J monk behind the sabonis screen that's short and Sacramento in a bad way right now down 22 Kings got to reather re-calibrate re-energize down by 22 here on the first of six on the road halftime coming up in a minute Toyota class

begin receiving messages the Rosen and the Kings getting ready to play here in the third quarter he has 14 but boy the second half told a big story last night yeah time now for our SMUD clean power play you look at kind of the differential last night the Kings really picked up their defense were able to outscore the Warriors 7552 in the second half a lot of that obviously had to do with the ability of Demar Derozan to get his offense going but the defense as a whole was spectacular and truly they're going to need a very similar performance here tonight to be able to inch themselves back into this game down 22 to this nuggets team that you know has a true Advantage at altitude second n of a back toback there's a lot of things working against Sacramento right now but I keep going back to what Doug Christie says about these situations don't look at it as an obstacle look at it as an opportunity we're about to find out who we are and what we're made of use this as an opportunity to really form that and Derozan will bring it across here to start the third quarter guarded by Christian Braun here's Murray box back door cut to monk one more Murray wide open great look great result for the Kings and I love that three exactly what we were talking about a moment ago it touched uh touch-point game and he obviously has ties here to Denver drafted Yeah by traded to I believe the Bulls Sacramento in a zone go DeAndre Jordan got to Str shot clock at five good close up by lyes on Murray and they get the stop wonderful pursuit of the ball two by Trey Lyles and that box out by Doug mcder on DeAndre Jordan you got to give him a lot of credit box Off the Mark and boy a big time board by DeAndre Jordan he's in the ball game now for Jokic sitting down with a triple double Gordon in the corner they're try and walk down Fox Miss an easy one lyes the trailer three rattles at home Sacramento says put that defibrillator away the lead is down to 14 with 837 to go take them off the critical list put a pause on that cause of death certificate back in a moment back in it hey nominate an elementary middle or high school teacher today with a chance to win $30,000 for their

after the timeout Jokic back in the ball game it speaks to the severity of this king's run and what it's done to Michael Malone's mindset Katie to put his star back in yeah it took just a few minutes of game time for the Kings s rally with an 110 run and that did Force Michael Malone's hand and you know that you know they like the ability to be able to rest him as much as possible in the fourth quarter and I think they probably felt that they were going to be able to comfortably do so they've got a big National Television game coming up on Saturday against Minnesota Jokic against ly sprays it out to Braun that's way off Murray got their first and Sacramento with an opportunity here ly in Rhythm for three butter and the lead is down to 11 and this this shifted quickly I mean this is a 22-point lead by dver that is dissipated the first four minutes of this quarter Watson thought about it Jokic in the middle of the lane good contest throws up a brick whistle and they're going to call a foul Ray aosta called foul let's look at Trey ly first though yeah and in transition these are the types of Threes you like where you step into it knock it down like that Kings have up the pace they're putting a lot of pressure and there's the foul that they called Jokic at the free throw line and I got to correct myself Le got up to 25 for Denver wow so Kings have have done a great job of just relentlessly trying to cut into this lead Jokic missed the first an 81% foul shooter on the season goes one for two lad is 12 Denver shooting under 62% from the from the free throw line in tonight's game fox out top for Sacramento off the L Green Jokic in the drop that's a great matchup give it back to him they run grenade 10 on the shot clock for L put a shoulder into his opponent got his put back draws the foul wonderful unrelenting unyielding effort by Trey lyes that opportunity and can we just talk about it because PJ Washington or Watson rather really good shot blocker and he uses his body gets his shoulder into him and then able to make space for himself to get that shot off and then when it doesn't go he is surrounded by rebounders and it's Trey ly that comes up with the second chance opportunity all a 78% foul shooter knocks down the first coming off a seven-point game last night against Golden State to go Kings clawing their way back into it goes one for two got to finish your breakfast especially when you're down 11 to bring it up like that no no you definitely got to put pressure on them instantaneously and you got to remember this you know obviously Doug mcdermit has stepped in and just been unconscious from Beyond The Arc but when you're tired mentally is where it can challenge you the most and you look at Doug's career three-point field goal shooting number 40% on his sare ninth among active players so he knows what the assignment in and he has stepped in and answered the call but I feel like the the hesitation in terms of trying to speed up this nuggets team as you said a moment ago really is just lack of it's It's the mental um exhaustion we're seeing from Sacramento Jokic at the free throw line knocks down the second second ACO takes time out with 41 seconds to go Kings putting up a great fight here very combative down here in the stretch run but down s 41 seconds to go it's got to be a quick three here coming out of this huddle yeah no matter what unless you're looking at a four-point play this is a two- possession game and so with 41 seconds left on the clock what Denver is going to try to do when they have possession of the ball Mark is they're going to really try to slow it down they're going to put Jokic on the the low block and they're going to try and you know dribble the air out of the ball you have to be quick and and concise in what you're doing defensively and then J Triano right now talking to them about what they're going to look to do offensively yeah well Doug McDermot has been brilliant spellbinding captivating in this fourth quart he's five of six from downtown and he's breathed life singlehandedly into the Sacramento Squad and just an excellent call by Doug Christie coming out of uh the quarter timeout starting him in the fourth quarter and just letting him loose and Doug MC durit knows the assignment he knows what he is on the floor to do and that yes the clock is working against you when you're down 25 to this nuggets team and he single-handedly just breathed life into this Kings team monk will trigger and Michael Malone calls timeout for Denver Christian Braun covers a lot of ground on the wings good Defender and a great sense of anticipation there yeah and obviously knowing that the momentum has been with Doug with derit so the anticipation of yes there's going to be an extra pass and it's going to Doug me dermit probably a lot of people could have made assumption yeah well Doug mcder will be one of the I guess residual positive takeaways from this game when you look at the team moving forward on this road trip when you look at kind of what is happened since Doug Christie has taken over this is the 13th game this is going to be um the third loss if if Denver is able to pull this out that it's been different situations so this is an opportunity right here where Doug has stepped in when called upon and for Doug Christie it's important to know what his his tool set is right and so I think this is a great kind of thing to have um in your in your memory bank of like different options different ways that you can go with and that is one thing I will give Doug a lot of credit for he's very willing to to go with something else when something's not working let's go with another option and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see Doug mcder a little bit more here going forward as a result of this just to see if that's a flow that they can go with certainly a great weapon tonight Off the Bench Jokic draws the foul from monk 15.3 seconds to go Jokic back at the free throw line and the only question now is well the Kings get some quality sleep tonight on their way to New York to take on the Knicks on Saturday and then Brooklyn on Monday had an interesting conversation with Domantas at breakfast this morning and I said big fell what do you do for a sleep plan do you have a sleep plan he said no you know usually on a back to back like this I'll just try and drink some chamomile tea and that'll relax me and give me a good night's sleep I said how many hours did you get last night he said about four and a half oh my gosh there not enough tea in the world no it's it's it's brutal I mean there are definitely there's times where the NBA schedule plays you and this is one of them and when you talk about you know it's a great way to put it K we got you know we got our to into our rooms about in the morning and we're leaving right after this game game and we're probably going to get to our hotel about tomorrow morning in New York so rest up tomorrow that'll do it Denver Falls pardon me Sacramento falls to the Sacramento Kings by nine 132 to 123 despite a huge 38o fourth quarter we saw sabonis and Russell Westbrook a moment ago they were teammates at OKC sabonis said that he learned so much from Westbrook as a rookie on how to put in the work and how to be relentless sabonis with another impressive double double with 23 points 19 rebounds and eight assists team will jump on the charter in a few hours and make their way to Metropolitan New York to take on the Knicks and then Brooklyn Saturday and Monday right
