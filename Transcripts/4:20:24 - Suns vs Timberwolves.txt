 get everything you need to shine or pick it up at one of our 6200 stores spruce up hotpots and refine the details it's easy to shine with AutoZone Z Auto welcome everyone to Minneapolis on the banks of the mighty Mississippi folks we're in the shadows of musical Transcendence the late great Prince of CIS Timberwolves fan and Native would urge the fan base here today to party like it's 99 because Minnesota has had its best season in 20 years as we welcome you to the NBA Playoffs presented by coule pixel it's the first round presented by ESPN bet from Target Center here in Minneapolis the Phoenix Suns led by a couple of quazars KD and Booker taking on the Minnesota Timberwolves as we take a little bit of inventory a huge weekend of basketball here on ESPN and ABC tomorrow on ABC it's the Clippers Dallas meanwhile a huge one tonight as the Lakers try to snap that eight-game losing streak against the reigning Champs the Denver Nuggets hello everybody I'm Mark Jones courts side along with the Hall of Famer huie Brown George Sano joining us in just a bit hu let's start with Minnesota they spent most of the year in first place in the west and as we take a look at who's ruling the court brought You by Burger King if they're going to get by the Suns they'll need the best version of the imperious Anthony Edwards no doubt about it now he he had a sensational season 64 225 gave you 25 points a game leading this team he's explosive not only in the open court excellent defensively and then can hit the three meanwhile there's about 20 All-Star appearances between Phoenix's big three here I would say big challenge for Minnesota tell tell us about the big three for them well when you look at the big three from Phoenix you have two guys averaging 27 points a game Durant Booker and then be has come in now with a cool 18 very difficult to defend as we take a look at our tonight's starting lineups brought to you by matelo Booker Beal in the back court Allen Durant nurkic on the front line Conley and Edwards in the back court for Minnesota McDaniels Gobert and Karl Anthony-Towns Karl Anthony-Towns playing in just his third game back since returning from a knee injury it'll be Phoenix to bring it up into the front Court to start this game Booker being guarded by Mcdaniels here's Beal Edwards trying to stick him Durant with a catch a mismatch on the edge against Gobert that's one of the prevailing story lines and Gobert got the stop heads up here Edwards in transition back to towns the trailer a little bit strong McDaniels with a big time put back now this guy can be invaluable in this series mainly because he's going to play one of the great offensive players at the other end but at 6' n he can help you on the glass keep in mind folks the Phoenix Suns defeated Minnesota all three meetings during the regular seasons the margin of victory was double digits each time Durant cash now this is very difficult coverage now anytime that you have go or also towns picking up the rant because of off the dribble he's murder he can hit the three and in the mid-range game no one's better tough cover for a lot of Defenders here's Karl Anthony-Towns out to Conley one more Edwards McDaniels from the corner and it comes off to Booker Devin Booker having a very prolific season for the Suns Mark I'm just interested here now can the Phoenix Suns keep Minnesota off of the offensive boards can they do that because of the fact that you're giving away a lot of size you look at Minnesota's front line 72 7 feet 69 and then with Durant now having to play one of those two big guys because of small ball the glass always tells the story Durant with his second consecutive field goal Kevin Durant not that far off of a 50 4090 season this year oh no no come on now he always is challenging you know that he's one of nine guys that have done it and he has come close many other times Edwards into the paint tried to spray it out Durant with the steal it's a two-on one Booker hits Durant the trail in Edwards great recovery defensively see he just showed you right there the explosion he trail that play all the way and he raises up for the midi they need him because they went 0 and three this year against Phoenix why because they held him to 14 points for the series Booker with a quick three at the other end oh it hit the top of the backboard it's going to be ruled out of bounds yeah the refs were right on top of that come back the other way see now Pace early is what you would hope if you're Phoenix this is what you want you want to go up and down and then you want to get the mismatches on Durant and Booker but at the other end of the floor now uh can you keep Minnesota in a slow game and then keep them off the second shots Edwards into heavy traffic they peeled him clean and he commits the foul and that's what it looked like a lot of times as we look at a potential take foul he sees a lot of bodies at the defensive end now you're going to see right here now any anytime this goes the double team is right there now they're going to attack him that want to give away now mainly Edwards this is what they've done to him in this series this is hard to believe a guy that's averaging 25 for the season and only average 14 in the three games so give them a lot of credit with their double teaming can he stay away from a turnovers like that or B shooting a bad percentage from behind the three-point line shot right around the league average this year at about 36.5% Phoenix leading by one Bradley Beal inside nkic with the slam yeah I see you want that and also the fact that every time that you see towns on Durant you also have to explore explore that also here's Conley little floater that's his shot with the off hand and go with the cleanup yeah see that's where they're going to be tough throughout this entire series because Gobert and towns are excellent on the offensive boards Tim Conley has built this Minnesota team much like he built the reigning Champs the Denver Nuggets a lot of length on the front line nurkic on the glass and he draws the foul underneath against go now when you look at der just think about it 7 foot 290 he's a Bruiser and he's not going to step back now can he stay out of foul trouble night in and night out cuz they need him also wanted the big questions had a very productive year this year for the Suns sure averaged 1010 and four assists the first Phoenix player to do that since Charles Barkley oh that's a discontinue he dribbled and just dribbled again here's Beal being hounded by Edwards nurkic from Deep comes off Gobert tapped it to Edwards look out here now got a little bit of space to work with and he's fouled by Grayson Allen it'll be side out of bounds on the Phoenix foul now you look at that and you say why did he do that he did that because hey he didn't want him to get to the glass two-point layup possible three if he gets fouled the big thing just foul as long as you're not in foul trouble yeah Chris Finch hu talked to us about getting some transition opportunities for Edwards just like that a moment ago Conley got to his strong hand and well defended by Grayson Allen made think tonight how will the referees handle you off the dribble in the paint big factor Booker snakes the screen got blocked by McDaniels Gobert chased it down and kept it in play oh look out here now got Advantage Edwards clean for three butter that's it this is what you want to see with this young guy mainly because of he plays with such energy you can just feel it as he's running passes right now he's ready to explode but the key in this series can he make a high percentage of three Booker on the Baseline McDaniels with the close out shot clock down to seven for Booker dumps it off for nkic put his shoulder into Gobert couldn't finish McDaniels with the the rebound for Minnesota well see that that was a battle between two guys there was a lot of contact I'm glad to see no call Conley with the spin loose ball tip back out got it back and got blocked by Nurkic from behind look out here KD into the front Court Durant got to the rim and lays it off glass one of the best one of the best who's ever played the game with off the glass plays the glass beautifully mid-range game can match any guy who's ever played shooting a high percentage and then you cannot let him be open behind a three-point one Speaking of three-point line Edwards had that rattle halfway down and out tied at nine just underway here in the opening quarter Durant already with seven quick points now this is a pace that Phoenix is looking for wow he was doing a drill right there come on he made it look Easy Come on towns and go if they pick him up you no come on they're hoping that he doesn't drive on them all right make please make a mid-range or a longer shot yeah nice pass to go bear what a time yeah that was a beautiful look excellent excellent pass but the big key here was the double team break it with the intelligent pass NBA first round is presented by ESPN bat the official sports book of ESPN and him part by Google pixel the only phone engineered by Google the NBA Playoffs presented by Google pixel we're here in Minneapolis for the first round presented by ESPN bet Karl Anthony-Towns is back for the Minnesota Timberwolves it's only his third game after his miniscus tear that he's recovered from when I talked to Chris Finch his head coach he told us that Karl Anthony-Towns is really only at about 80% of where he should be in regards to playoff shape so he's not in tiptop playoff shape and he's going to have to deal with the tall task of Defending Kevin Durant most of this particular series particularly when the Suns go small the one advantage though for Karl Anthony-Towns he's lost some weight according to Finch about 20 lbs so hopefully that's something that helps him defensively against theant Josie yeah he's a big part of this Minnesota team spent yesterday afternoon with Karl senior having a little coffee relaxing and Edwards with the step through got it to go now that time that was great after because the defense rotated cut off the path and He adjusted oh Durant smoked an easy dunk at the other end Minnesota leading by two Edwards touches the pain again got blocked by Nurkic excellent defense back to Booker coming back the other way against Conley spins pass somehow made it through to Nurkic and he lays it home see now there's the strength that was a seven foot guy taking another 7 foot2 guy and and Hing him to the rim with him on his back nage does a lot of the dirty work for the sun Squad tremendous screener here's Karl Anthony-Towns going at Durant left it short in the early going now Minnesota on at least three to four occasions have taken bad shots inside the 15 ft and Devin Booker knocks down the three ball Booker shooting 36% from the three-point line this year successful season Once Again actually a career in assists as well just think of this Durant was fifth in scoring at 27 and then Booker was sixth in scoring at 27 not bad great duel go with the pass we'll call it a pass this is your major advantage mainly because anytime neric leaves that area you have the size to penalize that Nurkic again inside put his shoulder right in into Go's chest well that's like I said are is that a foul see that's a big question mark tonight are you going to allow body contact in those situations in the painted area by these big people ball knocked out of bounds off of go Bear's need folks let's take a look at tomorrow's playoff schedule on ABC and TNT playoffs underway in Earnest and you have to love it ABC has Miami at Boston game one Dallas at the Clippers game one as well at after that then TNT has Indiana Milwaukee followed by the Pelicans at OKC 7 and respectively for more on these games please go to nba.com or visit the NBA app as OKC meets the pelicans pelicans getting by the Sacramento Kings last night in the playing Tournament game Booker picked up by Naz Reid who's in the ball game and sometimes it doesn't matter who's in front of Devin Booker H well you see just think about it all this time we play that's only the third time that he's hand handle the ball Alexander Walker waltzes through the paint with the Lefty leg now if you are out of the highlighted athletes in this game you can make yourself seen and you can do a lot of damage here cuz there's so much stubble teaming Walker a pretty decent on ball Defender picking up Booker McDaniels on Durant he's going to walk him down and we're going to have the foul against McDaniels was holding KD's jersey like a grud had a full grab of it that's going to be the third team foul against the Timberwolves first on McDaniels say well you know why didn't he foul in that time look this guy called Durant has only been the scoring champion in this league four times that's all right and he has done the 50 40 90 and close about five other times two-time Finals MVP raises up light work for Kevin Durant well I tell you he's he's up for this game there's no doubt about that you can see the energy and the athleticism that he's showing and everything below the foul line era Edwards out top he gets double team Booker switches on to him out to the wing Alexander Walker this is what you're looking for now if they're going to keep double teaming Edwards every time that he breaks the top of the circle come on there's a guy wide open Booker off the Stagger rebounded by Gobert underneath and here comes Edwards surveys the floor picked up by Royce O'Neale little empty Corner two-man game with Gobert Edwards playing with his food over to Naz Reid for three got it now look this is a guy that plays back up Center for you that makes three so got to give him a lot of credit off the bench a 13 game he's definitely in that six-man of the year uh award yes he has to be considered him and Malik monk of the Kings amongst others keep an eye on Kevin now remember like he said now he can take you up to dribble but where he is dangerous is in underneath the three-point line NFL great Adrien Peterson in the building tonight got a little bit of company with Justin Jefferson oh man he got dri for sale look at that jacket meanwhile Mike Conley wired for sound today let's go hey let's go let's go right now man don't wait let's go W on three 1 2 three W go go go go go don't wait don't wait let's go my boy let's go my boy yeah three it's all good it's a good shots way to run though M Conley the veteran and the adult in the room a lot of times with this Minnesota Squad had a wonderful impactful speech to his teammates the day after the regular season ended moving forward in what their goals and motivations should look like in the playoffs here's towns double teamed on the wing Naz Reid with five of the shot clock Alexander Walker made the last one that one way off and rebounded by O'Neale this game is about a half a step if you're a half a step slow you're in deep trouble here love that hooker trying to SL him through the traffic lost the ball Reid has Anderson with them Reid got Stripped by Eric Gordon out of bounds it'll stay at that end Minnesota basketball Timber will shooting 46% Sun's 50 before the game started you and I both thought that Phoenix would be running them off the floor or putting a lot of pressure on them and he it's just the reverse how about that that's right right now Minnesota is doing a terrific job of getting it up unfortunately they're blowing an awful lot of opportunities inside of the three-point line and one part of the good news from Minnesota coach is that Anthony Edwards has already taken five shots in this game he's three for five he was in single digits in the last meeting that's a whistle and a foul and they're going to call go tend actually instead of the foul so to put Minnesota up three if you haven't seen Phoenix play in the last month or so you can see their coverages have been very good uh they might double and you pass the ball thinking that you're going to get a wide open shot they're rotating there so they're making you make the second pass if you want a good shot they've moved up into the top half of the league in defensive rating at about 13 wide open O'Neale from Deep got it and the game is noted at 25 with 1 minute to go here in the opening quarter this guy has been an excellent addition to this team he comes as an experienced guy who can make the shots from the perimeter and then defend him board and he's made the postseason in each of his Seven Seasons yes most of them with you Edwards and they're going to call an offensive foul on Anthony Edwards now we had a bad angle on that from our seat but let's just see here on this replay now there it is oh he's definitely there there no no doubt about that but like we say now you're getting to where you want to go mat now can you read the defense and get a high percentage shot and up until now Minnesota is missing a lot of opportunities huie that's going to be Edward's second personal foul was speaking with Edwards and Chris Hines the assistant coach saying Edwards has to crack the code in this game and to do so he's got to move it quickly and get off of it quickly and play that point five oh yeah you got to read the things quick today here now in the early gone can these teams both pick up the rotations for 48 minutes O'Neale missed the layup Karl Anthony-Towns battling for the defensive board let me ask you how many layups do you think they missed already at least three or four okay they've been in there unfortunately the ball's not getting up Above the Rim towns battering his way to the bucket and draws the hit he'll go to the free throw line for a couple of shots car Anthony-Towns missed some 18 games in the last quarter of the season the result of a knee injury and a subsequent procedure on said knee but spoke to him yesterday when he was sitting down having a coffee with his father Karl senior who's Courtside here this afternoon he says there's no pressure he's looking forward to the competition against a great team in Phoenix and he has a lot of help doesn't have to do it himself with Anthony Edwards and his teammates who picked him up and lifted him up all season look this guy missed 20 games he still scored 21 points a game and he puts a lot of pressure on him because he can take any mismatch in the post or he can make threes he can shoot a high percentage from threes so by losing him during that period of time look they were comfortable for quite a few months this season at number one in this very very tough division NZ Reid did a nice job filling in I know you just love towns cuz he's a jersey guy like you see I didn't want to say that two-point Minnesota lead be surveys the defense looks like they're giving it a little bit of a Zone look here yeah that's okay now you're going to help out it's like a little soft two three Zone it's nice to see them change defenses O'Neale from Deep brings up his second three ball he cashes out at the buzzer that always cancels surprise you can you can surprise and they did unfortunately the the shot opened up and this guy is not afraid to take shots from the side of the Court he can shoot a high percentage get everything you need to shine or pick it up at one of our our 6200 stores spruce up hotpots and refine the details it's easy to shine with AutoZone so if I make this you got to be my Fall Guy for the day all right so uh what exactly does the Fall Guy do Fall Guy Fall Guy how did you feel about your performance tonight I got it man where did you get this Fall Guy idea from anyway Fall Guy Fall Guy STS you're the Fall Guy it's time for tonight's access brought to you by Miracle Grow we here Frank vogle the head coach of the Suns one-point lead what were the positives in that quarter oh we're moving to basketball well you know that's when we're at our best when we're triggering the blender and uh pretty much taking care of it um but we got to do a better job on Edwards in transition getting too too free too many times is that the key defensively for you guys is Edwards the head of the snake here he's definitely the head of the snake in transition pick a roll ISO pin Downs all the ways they get him involved Frank good luck thank you thank you guys back to you Alexander Walker with the tip in to make it a 2928 game Minnesota up Walker with seven quick points and be finally on the board with his first field goal y yeah well he's not going to force anything he's a veteran guy he's been around a long time let me just bring out one point about Edwards they can talk now he's got seven points a couple assists he's got four turnovers that is that's a major factor so far speaks through the attention and the pressure there putting on him forcing him to make many decisions and they're quick you got to give them credit now they're quick to their double teams nurkic hands it off to Beal who touches the paint sprays it out to Gordon on the Baseline got a whistle and a traveling violation against Eric Gordon the come back Minnesota basketball the fourth turnover for the Suns we know that this is a heavyweight play a light heavyweight and a light heavyweight is trying to keep the pressure in quickness and getting up and down and everything now can both teams establish their style for the full 48 minutes that's one of the prevailing story lines hey not always easy moving up in weight class right not not not in here now I mean come on now anytime you put a 72 and a 7 foot guy out there and a 69 guy they don't he looks like a guard okay Conley out top sprays it to the corner Anderson made his last one that one comes off and rebounded by Grayson Allen who this year led the NBA in three-point shooting percentage and recently rewarded with a $70 million contract he's had a terrific season uh because he he is not only a number one three-point shooter in the league percentage wise but he minimizes the amount of shots he takes and that's great because the shooting percentage is there to back him up and you just like that uh because he's uh he's he's not afraid of the pressure and neither is Bradley Beal with the and one uhoh Beal working out his right leg a little bit landed hard of course he's been through a Litany of injuries this year that foul is going to go against Anderson as second here's another look strong move but yeah you can see he clipped it clipped the knee there Bradley Beal playing his best basketball of the Season late in the year get this folks he endured a broken nose ankle Springs has a finger injury that he's playing with right now although he says his jumper okay but it has been a very trying and turbulent year for Bradley Beal talked about the experience with ANS Scapes Mark Spears in a recent diary entry good piece you want to check out I remember now Beal missed 29 games but he still came in and gave them 18 the last five games over 20 points a game Reid went hard to the cup and Drew the hit looks like it's going to go against Nurkic that's going to be his first personal foul second team foul against the Suns putting Reid at the free throw line Naz re at the free throw line shooting 74% on the season don't forget coming up next right here on ESPN guys please Jaylen Brunson wow looked like he is dressed for success and Josh Hart in the background there the New York Knicks getting ready to play against the 76ers a very streaking match up there a quick about conferences Western Conference five teams have won over 50 games in the East only two teams and the Knicks are one of them at 50 what a year they've had that's absolutely right and Brunson fantastic season Gordon with a rebound off the read Miss Minnesota leading by one Gordon picked up nicely by Conley that's indeed there's a reason why this Minnesota team is number one defensively nurkic picked up his dribble had it knocked loose with six on the clock Beal and it comes off to Alexander Walker into the corner Reid nice fight and he put Reid on the flight O'Neale on a flight here's Alexander Walker out of bounds it'll stay at that end Minnesota basketball had a couple of good looks I'm surprised that how many times Phoenix has been within 6 to8 feet of the basket and elevating high but have not been able to finish now you can say well there's a lot of body contact well if there's a lot of body contact they should be at the fat line but if there isn't enough body contact they're still missing the shots but they're there it's the opportunity is there you bring up a great Point hu the last time these two teams played Booker and the Suns there was a little bit of contentiousness with some of the non calls and Anthony Edwards got into it with ch pardon me with Frank vogle at one point and after that bucket Minnesota leading by three again heel into the front Court McDaniels with that last bucket an open look comes off and here comes J mcel Monte Morris walks into the three that was a long one just checked into the ball game too no lather and Grayson Allen with some Pace Grayson Allen has held the basketball only a few times in this half so far and Bradley Beal with the layup and that underscores a point that vocal told us that he's one of the few guys that gives them good Rim pressure yeah very good that's a good point Jo Bradley Beal gives them a different feel and look Alexander Walker with the three man he is on point tonight see they're not switching so the defender is going over the top and if if you're going to go that or go under and Far Away they'll get those open shots time and time again Alexander Walker Off the Bench with 10 points Morris with the rebound and you talked about some of those supporting cash guys like Walker potentially having big nights here's McDaniels lost his balance against Beal missed everything but it goes right to go bear he missed everything knocked out of bounds it'll stay Minnesota B basketball up by four as Edwards comes back in the ball game for Chris Finch 5 Seconds to go on the shot clock yeah from Minnesota if if you were coaching Phoenix coming into this game you would have to say one of your big priorities is holding them to one shot now so far they're getting extra shots because of their size so all Five Guys have got to rebound defensively here you cannot be leaking out to to start the break you got to get the basketball Minnesota out rebounding Phoenix U by a margin of 19- 10 so far I'm tell you well where most C thema right there in the paint the offensive bless it'll be side out of bounds after the foul that's the third team foul against the Suns Booker picking that one up 755 to go on this opening Saturday of the NBA Playoffs beginning in Earnest on ESPN in and ABC Lakers and Nuggets on ABC a little bit later tonight and the Knicks as well Edwards boy KD moved his feet exceptionally well did yes he did Conley spins pulls got it oh my what a shot by Conley and a fade away to boot okay Minnesota leading by six hooker off the screen pocket pass see little room service and one for nkic at The Rim now every time that the ball goes from one side of the court to the other all right you can do your defense is that they're doing the defense has been really hustling except if the guy releases now just watch this see if he releases and go where's the rotation if you are going to try to trap that high outside Conley arriving a little bit late that time sending Nurkic to the line no well even if he was there I come on now might not have made much difference I guess we're talking seven foot to 63 I I don't know if it would have made a difference nurkic telling me that he lost about 8 PBS during Ramadan which just ended last week still getting back some of his strength and endurance Edwards sprays it out to the wing McDaniels little congestion in the paint Durant hit the deck Nurkic closed out on McDaniels Booker with good help and Phoenix with wonderfully defense easy there Booker and McDaniels after the whistle how can you tell it's playoff time they are really competing out on the floor now just keep an eye on this now this is just good ball movement you come in you take the Trap you throw it to the corner too far for the big man to rotate let's take a look at how Nelle Alexander Walker is enjoying the linelight brought to you by Corona Extra having a big afternoon knocked down two early threes and actually leads the NBA in corner threes made and right now pacing the Timberwolves bench attack the second unit that has come in for Minnesota has done a nice job in establishing open shots high percentage Shots by good ball mov n Alexander Walker is going to be representing basketball Canada at the Olympics this coming summer he'll be in the back court with Shay Alexander gilis Alexander coached by Sacramento Kings soon to be Brooklyn Nets head coach Jordy Fernandez well let's put in the United States team we have Booker and Durant that's not bad and then at the other end come on now you have Rudy go bear fighting for France this game I think is well represented yeah good defense there excellent look at Rudy move his feet on Booker got on the Baseline oh lay what a great move what a great move and give give Gobert a ton of credit he stayed with him for a number of seconds forced a great shot by Booker who has nine in the game check that seven Karl Anthony-Towns inside and one anytime yeah anytime you get that kind of a that's not a mismatch but it's Durant playing towns in a low post that's the first time we've seen him in the low post in this game now that can go either way all right it depends upon the angle that the referee has whether it's an offensive foul or whether it is a defense and you're taking away the area but you're still moving into a a you know like a bad uh angle tough shot by Karl Anthony-Towns Durant picking up his first personal foul he was actually towns was playing in a high school baseball game when he got a call from an au coach going into his junior year of high school his dad and him drove through the night to Chicago he really rocked out in a tournament in front of Scouts became a top 100 Prospect like that well living in Central Jersey like he was he only had about Z you know you can't count as high offers to go to high school never mind college to go the different ice go George has an update on Kyle Anderson George Jonesy he's got a right hip pointer he walked back to the locker room tried to come back to the bench was still in pain and walked back to the locker room his return is questionable and he's a key part to that bench crew that hu was discussing certainly is Hu be Kyle Anderson a big connector for that team right oh absolutely big thing here right now come on Edwards has got to come down get closer in a three-point if the guy's going to be off six feet let's let's know close up the distance Durant on the drive by Drew the foul he'll get a couple of shots now if you're if you're a phoenix fan you're happy to see this guy come on this guy in the first quarter average got nine points here he's got to get more reps because he's you can see the energy in Kevin tonight he is really making terrific moves to the hall and he's not going away from any contact he's initiating scored nine quick points to begin the game and missing that first free throw hey get the NBA after for Non-Stop playoff access with realtime scores and highlights and go behind the scenes with new episodes of The Original Series Chasing history download the NBA app today that chasing history is a lot of fun to watch gr at the free throw line and Frank Vogal telling us just how impeccable he is with his assiduous work ethic Real Time game speed and everything he does four-point lead for Minnesota Durant up to 12 here's Edwards on the wing guarded by Beal see there that that's that's a little bit of Suma right there now not only did we have the contact outside we just had two guys sandwich and we don't get a call here now now watch this now now he gets hit here by two people kind of reminds me of the 80s and 90s there huie Brown well as we know you have to adjust the way the three people are calling the game come on this is not crybaby time now this is this is where you got to stand up and be tough off the re miss everybody knows NBA stands for no babies allowed that's right Booker on the probe inside good defense by McDaniels out of bounds give McDaniels credit here now cuz he had we had a good look at that he stayed in front of him off the dribble line this is hard to do this guy averaged 27 a game this year how about the crossover and he still didn't shed him he reacted defensively and played him perfect he forced Booker into his chest Booker took it outside to the edge and misfired 5 minutes to go in the first half Minnesota leading by four Anthony Edwards with the rock three of six from the field gets Booker on the switch and that's going to be a foul against Devin Booker that's his second personal foul that's going to put Anthony Edwards on the free throw line and now a little bit of contentiousness and enmity between the two teams players bumping their gums a little bit as Edwards will stroll to the free throw line look we're seeing people get after people here tonight and it's beautiful to watch because the energy is coming right off the floor guys are not allowing you to get a half a step and if you do get have to step the forearm is up helping him to slow you down and now it comes down to contact what's a foul tonight see and but it's going on at both ends you just love it because it's the playoffs you're expecting this and I just like the enthusiasm of every player that's out there Edwards huie with eight points after that free throw five-point lead for the Timberwolves having their most successful season in 20 years KD almost discarded Alexander Walker and left it on the front rim Reid with a rebound yeah see they Kevin tried to get rid of him now you know with the back for but we didn't see what happened adman went Airborne Pat with the Finish wow hubby Anthony Edwards popped the clutch and change gears well this is what we're saying now can you keep can you keep Minnesota off of that offensive glove glass this is just a great move I'm shifting gears split it all right there's the block but now Second Chance opportunity get everything you need to shine or pick it up at one of our 6200 stores spruce up hotpots and refine the details it's easy to shine with AutoZone so if I make this you got to be my Fall Guy for the day all right so uh what exactly does the Fall Guy do Fall Guy Fall Guy how did you feel about your performance tonight I got it man where did you get this Fall Guy idea from anyway Fall Guy Fall Guy STS you're the Fall Guy just tell Siri show me today's basketball ball scores welcome back everyone to Minnesota and the Target Center in Minneapolis Kevin Durant in the Suns right now trailing coach Durant had nine quick points in the first couple of minutes of the game what do you see as what's happened since that time well first of all he started off on fire he was four for five and he was getting good looks then all of a sudden there's more physical contact the double team is getting to him quick he's now one for six since that time that's what that puts a pressure on the coaching staff to get him open in his high percentage areas all right where it's a one-on-one or he's open Durant on the horns touch comes off the Nurkic screen the top mid-range shooter in the game this year the president of the midi committee Durant well there's no doubt about it because even if you're with him 610 611 7 who knows how tall he really is cuz no one will own up to that big time bucket by McDaniels and one see I like what we're seeing from the guys that make it happen for this Minnesota team they are playing great and they're getting good opportunities to score that's going to be the second foul against nurkic and McDaniels average a little over 10 per game on the season he's got six now you got to give Lage a lot of credit at his size and how much weight he carries he is quick to pick up your man if the guy's in the paint now I want to give you the a a a stat right now as a fan Second Chance point 14 to0 Minnesota 14 to Z nurkic on the roll sprays it out to Durant one more one more Neal they had Minnesota in the blender but couldn't convert Edwards in the front Court got it back from towns and lays it home great pass great pass by towns because he waited he kept the ball over his head he waited for Edwards to open up Durant at the other end will go to the free throw line for a couple of shots see anytime you play high low pick and roll right here now just watch this see what down inside as soon as that Defender gave up and allowed Edwards to get a half a step in front of him the pass was right on the money remember now seven feet people when they make the great passes in that it's it's exhilarating to the bench to the guys on the floor because they're not only thinking of themselves at this time they're going to create if you cut hard and creative passing Lane makes the game a little bit easier for Edwards too who just picked up his third foul coach n that's going to be like this this entire series and we could tell you right now Edwards is three for seven from the field all right but he still has that four turnover so that's that's incred a major plus since he's come in in that second quarter well we talked about Kevin Durant getting more touches and looks he scored the last six since we came out of that last commercial break the lead is down to eight as we approach three minutes to go in the opening half game one between Minnesota and Phoenix the three and six seats going at it Town spins got peeled clean inside and here comes Booker Durant Allen they repost it they repost it again to Kevin Durant double team from McDaniels Allen missed everything well you know what he never moved anytime that you get that situation you go into the P you got to move a little bit stay behind the three-point he never moved an inch all right and that made it easy for the defense to rotate back out a whistle and a foul underneath against the Suns I tell you Kevin Durant is really working in this game he he's uh he's coming down to the bench right now but uh you can see he's hupping and puffing uh his effort is just terrific now he's saying something to the coaches over there whatever it is who knows but the big thing is is he's ready for this game and he's ready for this series former two-time NBA Finals MVP well coming up on the Toyota halftime first half recap Malika Steven A the legend Michael wilbon and big perk in the studio with all the news scores highlights and Analysis Booker meanwhile picked up his third personal foul on that last sequence kin Booker having a career high assist season almost seven per game and we're talking about USA Basketball he and Kevin Durant will be part of the team going to Paris to try to bring home the gold for USA Basketball for the fourth make it Fifth consecutive Olympics USA has won it four consecutive times so the hold of a moment ago we are told is because Bradley Beal had a little blood and they exercised has a little infection control and got him patched up you said it was going to be a bit of a fight coach I heard you say light heavyweight and heavyweight well come on now let's face it when you look at this division all right uh with three teams over 56 wins at the top in your Division and like we said earlier only two teams in the East they have three in one B division yeah 56 wins and you finished third that's right Durant sets the screen for Beal they get the switch B with the step back he is tough wow look come on in Washington how many points he scored we had to have to computer there every night so he's accustomed to but what you like about it not forcing anything outside he's getting into the paint this might be the best team and roster Bradley Beal has been with in his entire career in aamp chance to go very deep in the playoffs now that's that's just a beautiful move see that's a guy who recognizes the shot blocking tonight two big guys were in the paint going to may possibly pick off that shot to fade away stop on a dime can you hit the fade away when you're moving at that speed Karl Anthony-Towns at the free throw line who head coach Chris Finch calls a real he calls him a big Giver a very selfless teammate and huie when you go back to last year the union between towns and Gobert and the rest of the squad was at times a little bit clumsy it took a little bit of time and nobody was more giving and nobody did more to assimilate Gobert to Minneapolis on and off the court than that guy you're looking at right there Karl Anthony-Towns and Gober told me earlier when we were here he said Mark good things sometimes take a little bit of time well it has to be you go from a five position playing centers all of a sudden now you're playing fours and you're playing outside of 15 ft defensively that changed his entire game and then he was not wasn't the Sol post up guy now all of a sudden he's up high all the time in a three-point game here's that that rotation they've been doing a good job in and out of that George Sedano has more George Jonesy Chris Finch told me also a lot of that was defensively those two being able to work together Rudy Gobert in Utah a lot of drop coverage basically they told him here hey you're going to have free reain here as we see a foul there to be able to roam they told him you're going to have to be dependent on in all areas of the floor not just drop coverage and that allowed those two to kind of work together in Union defensively they're flowing in and out of a matchup zone right sometimes it looks 131 sometimes it looks 2 three but right there he got fouled off a hip foul and it was an excellent call putting Grayson Allen at the free throw line knocks down the first free throw Allen shooting 88% from the stripe on the season and says that his success this year shooting the basketball goes all the way back to the stability that he's been able to attain both on and off the court look anytime that you're number one in three-point shooting percentage 40 6% I would say he works at his game yes and his shooting coach Chris Matthews nice head inside with the jump hook so you got to see more of that you cannot allow Durant get away with playing behind him when he has that advantage of upper body strength and he can he can make the hook shot or the fadeaway Allen got picked off Alexander Walker got to the rim ladies and home pretty Nickeil Alexander Walker out here careering this afternoon ah he's playing a terrific half here and another turnover oh three on one the other way McDaniels and he's fouled by Beal the number one defensive team putting the clamps on yub yeah no no they're getting out here now you know they're kind of surprising everybody that they're dominating the fast break game now that was just a terrific finish and then they they backed it up with another interception they are applying great pressure on Phoenix not only in the break and the secondary but in the second chance opportunities they're murdering them okay this a brutal half right now for them this game looks so much different or at least this half so far coach looks so much different than the three previous meetings between these two teams that's right don't we say throw away what going on here in the here who was hurt who was absent you know and so for and then we have back to backs you're right about that second chance points 16-2 Minnesota 90 fast Sprite points Durant looking for his got the foul on Mike Conley on the reach and that's going to be two shots for Kevin Durant at the free throw line that's a second personal foul for Conley see coming to do this game today you're thinking styles of play right uh but when you say Do you think that Minnesota would have 16 to2 advantage in Second Chance points of course not right but they're doing it and then the other factor is nine o in fast breaks Now Phoenix is supposed to be fast breaking them okay and we're just seeing uh that second group that came in gave a great shot in the arm for Minnesota primarily Alexander Walker native of Toronto Ontario Canada the son of pardon me the oh no wonder you you know come on I I was wondering why your voice was going up here I got a Canadian passport still Co he and Shay gild's Alexander cousins 31 seconds to go here he is again left that one short Conley with another opportunity for Minnesota 10 on the shot clock around the Gobert screen good high by by nurkic got the deflection and the steel and that'll be a foul coming back the other way against Minnesota the Third on Conley so Minnesota is winning the non Anthony Edwards minutes here huie with him on the bench the lead at 12 right now I I just would like to say uh Nurkic is laying it all out here today this guy's 69 it's only 290 lbs he created that entire Opportunity by shooting the Gap and and forcing that loose ball underneath the basket it's been him against three people the majority of the night at both nkic as I said earlier the first Phoenix Sun player to average 1010 and four since Charles Barkley did it back in the mid90s I would say that's going back a little bit Conley will walk it up they can run it all the way down the shot clock is off crowd on its Collective feet towns with a ghost screen Nurkic switches on to Conley put him in the blender and a block by Nurkic what a defensive play by nage and that's the end of the first half he has put it all come on there you said it just a second ago and that's the end of the first 24 minutes Durant leading the Suns with 18 and at the other end Anthony Edwards with a good first half Edwards spent the latter part of the half on the bench and Karl Anthony-Towns picking up the slack offensively for the timber wolves perfect now here's the second chance Second Chance points 16-2 16-2 and then as you're watching all of this you go well how's that second unit doing 21 to six second unit guys favoring Minnesota n Alexander Walker one of the keys go bear inside well defended by nurkic the hulking huge shoulders of nurkic making a difference and Bradley Beal the same offensively at the other end knocking down the three ball Beal with his fifth field goal he's up to 11 seven-point lead for the visitors and keep in mind a lot has been mentioned about Phoenix's fourth quarter calamities but they're the best third quarter team in the NBA so look out if you're Minnesota they've come out here now in a little two three Zone they get a couple of consecutive stops here's Durant got to the mid-range that's where he makes his shots and he makes it look so easy remember that one he goes down in there and he goes up if he sees you're anywhere near him he just Fades and it's just beautiful how easily it rolls off his hand after consecutive bu buckets a nervous murmur through the crowd here at Target Center we have a whistle in a defensive 3 second violation against the Suns so that's going to put the Timberwolves at the free throw line looking for their first points of the third quarter here Phoenix in the middle of a N9 nothing run going back to the previous half towns going to take the free throw Karl Anthony-Towns Junior a 87% foul shooter on the season let's go to George Jonesy the Wolves Defenders playing a big role in this one Jaden Mcdaniels I mean he is in control defensively today the suns are shooting two of nine when he's the primary Defender including Devin Booker going one of five and of course Nickeil Alexander Walker three steals tied for fifth most by a t-wolf player in any half over the last 25 postseasons one last note here Kyle Anderson who had a hit pointer earlier in this game as we see a basket there by Anthony Edwards Kyle Anderson hit pointer he suffered in the first half out for this game Josie wow key part of their rotation he's their top eight guys yeah and a major guy CU he's a great passer at his size and he can score though bear has his work cut out for him Durant goes twe and finds nothing but cotton on that swish now when you're that size and you make that look so easy he went from side to side made two great moves and then the soft shot six-point lead Phoenix out of the gate quickly here in the third quarter quick drive by Conley missed the layup see right now Conley's one for eight that's got to change if they're going to keep the pressure on Allen back out to Durant Booker oh lost his balance and they're going to call a foul looks like against Michael Conley well I think that that you keep an eye here now there's the contact right from the rear uh not only the grabbing of the thigh from the back but you can see the contact there's no foul on the call Beal from the corner rims out and here's Conley off the outlet Karl Anthony-Towns with a quick drive got all the way to the steal and you know he made up his mind when he came over half court right in front of him he made up his mind he was going to do that car down 16 points Booker out top Nurkic flipped the screen for him back out to Allen nkic had position on go they didn't get he sure did yes oh and that's going to be an offensive foul against Grayson Allen yeah he got popped he got right in the face but that's on a move that's a normal move that a guy's trying to make when a guy is on top of him from the r just watch this now oh boom as he comes by he brings that left elbow it's too far out and the elbow catches him right in the face now he's trying to make an inside out move but that Defender was not moving we've seen that at both ends here tonight of great defense of guys taking physical contact to enforce the defense Mark Davis our official with Ben Taylor and Aaron Smith this afternoon they're going to take a look to see if this might be considered a hostile act Grayson Allen with the offensive foul let's take another look at it now you coaches teach this move all right it's an inside move and he was trying but give the defender all the credit in the world by coming up and causing that there was very very little room and unfortunately when you make that move that left elbow is going to be up just watch it now see right there he because he coming over he thinks that Defender is going to step back but he didn't there's one final look at it hey folks today's officials our crew chief Mark Davis referee Ben Taylor umpire Aaron Smith alternate Ashley moer gleich and the replay Center official inconus New Jersey is ginius petritis they're among the 36 officials selected to work the first round of the 2024 playoffs a group which is an average of over 16 years of NBA experience and includes eight officials who have worked 100 or more playoff games got their eyes on the action and making those Discerning calls this one a moment ago a foul against Grayson Allen yeah now you say look why did he make that move when he knew the guy was right on his back right I don't know why because we're not him and he just made a beautiful move except for one thing that Defender never steep back a half for step like you said coaches teach it that way h and you know it's so difficult to tell you you can't I would think it's difficult to aim with your elbow to purposefully get a guy in the job I just don't see that a lot of times don't see that of course Conley took that shot in the mouth yeah are you sure did Michael Conley had a great conversation with his teammates a couple of days ago as we get ready for the call upon review that has been determined at the ruling on the floor of offensive foul stands as the contact his his forearm was in a vertical position prior to the contact and Conley was in his natural space off no hostile act offensive foul stands talk about Mike Conley having a conversation with his teammates a couple of days ago going into the playoffs he said guys do not take these opportunities for granted when I was back with Memphis way way long ago I thought I'd get back to the Conference Finals every year after that it never happened so there's the quote and I'm paraphrasing urgency is at an all-time high and he tried to relate that selfishly he said hey do it for me if that's no if there's no other reason towns out top towns rejects the screen pulls the three yeah you look at that and you say oh that was lucky no that's not lucky towns during the season averages five three-point attempts and he shoots it you know at 41% so let's uh let's give a little credit here now it wasn't his first you know and never this is not an accident that's right after every three looks over at his dad court side as Durant counters with a little get back at the other end Kevin Durant up to 25 eight-point ball game temp W with the advantage Edwards with some touch action from Gobert in the mid-range knocks it home see with with the screener rolling that takes the big guy out of there and it gives Edwards an opportunity because he's ahead of the defender to elevate and get a clean look speaking of elevating Kevin Durant he's when he elevates that shots unblockable W look Kei he's one of the greatest offensive shooters that we've had ever in the history of the game and you have to remember how tall he is the only other guy that I have seen that I really admir was Dirk nitzki at Dallas and the two of them are guys that have done you know 50 40 90 it's a short list right that's right very short Beal with the follow draws the foul on the play Edwards and towns were in the vicinity of the foul and that's going to put Beal at the free throw line for a couple of shots it looks like with 738 to go here in the third quarter little conversation with and nurkic yeah it is because they don't want to listen to what the referee is saying uh and and you got to love it because the two guys it's been a war ever since they tossed up that opening ball it's going to be the second personal foul against Karl anthon towns Beal at the free throw line 81% free throw shooter hey the first round of the NBA Playoffs continues tomorrow afternoon on ABC a double header Eastern conferences top seat Celtics taking on the heat in game one of their series at one Eastern then out west it's the Mavericks and Clippers at Eastern our coverage begins at with NBA Countdown my favorite time of the year H Brown now remember now we we know that the rant is putting on a show Bookers having trouble getting shot attempts deal now has 13 points very quietly big three starting to gain a little traction con the double team missed them he missed the roll man six on the shot clock picked up his dribble Karl Anthony-Towns working off the bounce good defense by Allen inside they won't get a shot off the Phoenix Suns get a stop with 714 to go in the third now listen G give uh Allen a lot of credit he bellied right up on towns so that he couldn't a make the pass or two force a three-point shot and that ran off the clock wheel walks it across got a screen from Durant got the switch to Karl Anthony-Towns slammed on the brakes that's what Allstars do Bradley Beal with another bucket timeout Minnesota and the lead has been Whittle down to just four points when we come back to Target Center let's take a look at tonight's fantastic play brought to you by C ke now right now you got to see a man that's on fire here very quietly bringing his team back 15 points by Mark Kel and then also the fact that he's making things happen also at the defensive end I give him a ton of credit because very quietly he steps back and allows the rant and Booker to dictate shot opportunities but now he's stepping out remember he missed 29 games this year once he came back and got in shape in the last five games he averaged over 20 while the other two guys were getting their 27 game so this is an unusual for him right now but he's stepping up because he's feeling better physically adjusted his role of which he says it hasn't been easy playing this way but he enjoys the opportunity in front of him oh and right there he just stripped Edwards clean peeled him now I thought that was by I really I thought he was gone so Beal doing it at both ends as Karl Anthony-Towns on the edge Gobert switches on to him come on you got to see the mismatch Durant with six on the shot clock lost it out of bounds that's off of Minnesota towns went to the deck to try and retrieve it and 5 Seconds to go on the shot clock UB for the Suns yeah now now look that was that was great help defensively that took away the open lane cuz we had a great look at that Booker to trigger on the Baseline out of bounds out to Allen for three over Edwards and it rims out to Conway just think here tonight now Allen number one guy in the league 46% shooting threes cannot get an open look in this game 0 for three from d That's right all contested two Edwards working against Allen in the mid-range Anthony Edwards off glass see that's what you need now you need in this leag can you shoot the fade away and that's what that was why because Nurkic was coming to trap him if he tried one more bounce we are watching a young star decipher a defense in real time Durant fouled by Gobert part of Minnesota success was going to be Edward's ability to crack the code here huie yeah no this is see n is looking for him to make that extra bounce now you look at what we're seeing Anthony ID is now 7even for 12 from the floor and he's cut down he hasn't had any more turnovers since that first quarter the foul was against Rudy Gobert interesting to note that there are some 2800 fans assembled in Europe's largest cinema the iconic lron Rex in central Paris to watch Gobert and the Timberwolves take on Phoenix in game one here with the game at about p.m. Paris time so we got a crowd over there in France watching huie well I do believe that they 215 countries that do get the NBA package got love it it's a great Vibe folks McDaniels on the ball reversal Gobert spins and fires got it off it yeah now nket is right in his chest Now Phoenix does not like the call but give Gobert credit because he had a bad angle and he banks it in I just watch it now watch he has no right there as he turned nkers was right there shot right over the top of him the sh they'd Sayo very good Rudy with 6 and 11 on double double alert now this guy comes to work every night you know right now if you said how many rebounds do you think he has I don't think you'd be close he's got 11 rebounds already and we still have a quarter and five minutes to go goes about his business that's right eight-point Advantage for Minnesota McDaniels on Beal yeah they're laying off they're laying off so that it looks like a two3 Zone but it's not they're just matching up with you but they're trying to show you that there's coverage from the other side of the floor Hill got it back trapped in the corner Booker one more but it went off the underside of the backboard it's going to stay Phoenix ball was that deflected it had to have been touched by Minnesota because it hit the underside of the backboard out of bounds and it looks like they're going to talk this over so it'll stay Suns basketball time on on the floor with 511 to go in the period well more NBA basketball coming up to lmbb to the 76ers taking on the Knicks nexts right here on ESPN then over on ABC we cap the night with the Lakers and Nuggets at Eastern Pacific Time both games are also streaming live on the ESPN nap so you can watch the game anywhere which we will be on the way to the airport in the air and on the ground after that the foul shooting in this game has been excellent the Phoenix Suns are at 13 for 17 and then Minnesota 15 for 16 excellent keep in mind that Minnesota has yet to defeat Phoenix this year 0 and three against the suns in the regular season but as always the playoffs a different story hooker with the left didn't play good didn't play the glass okay Edwards finding his rhythm a little bit Twain spins pivots off one leg wonderful footwork he he gave us a number of moves right there 18 points that's right for Anthony Edwards he has been very efficient eight of 13 from the field good defense uhoh by Karl Anthony-Towns but maybe not a whistle and a foul Grayson Allen crumples to the court and slow to get up yeah he grabbed on to his shin at first let's take another look at it that's the third foul on towns well look when when towns tries to help out here now when he takes a step he's taking away a lot of ground there so now it comes down to how you read it as the ref now I'm just hoping that Allen is not seriously injured here let's hope he's going to go into the locker room with the athletic training staff we've got George Sedano on that O'Neale in his place rebounded by Edwards Edwards against Beal in the front Court got an empty Corner took the contact and left the shot short oh he wants a foul that's why he's talking to the referee on the way back be at the other end pretty left it short cowards in transition sees a wall of bodies that's that's right and they're and they're getting there quick Karl Anthony-Towns dumps it off to Edwards skip pass never made it to the corner in transition Booker back out to Durant one more Beal one more O'Neale they run a little offense here yeah well it was an excellent read and good defense by Alexander Walker to knock it away a whistle and a foul against Royce O'Neale Nickeil Alexander Walker disgarded by the Pelicans was on his way back to New Orleans signed a free agent deal in the aftermath of Co with Minnesota and he has history with Chris Finch his head coach here because Finch was an assistant with the Pelicans and he's really found a home in Minneapolis that foul against O'Neale alexand Walker out front and that will be an offensive foul against towns and he is perplexed that's his fourth U well you're going to see it's on the far side of the floor here and right there now you're at 72 and you're trying to post up and then Durant is not going to do that he's climbing over you all right neither team have used their respective challenges yet with 333 to go I think a lot of it been very obvious all right that's a good point no come on no it's appreciation of what we're seeing here by both teams Booker high off blast didn't get it to go Devin Booker this afternoon just three of 12 seven points Edwards little hesi took the hit couldn't finish go inside he got clber and he will go to the free throw line big pressure on the rim yeah now Edwards is upset because he didn't get the call uh he gave a great move when he change sides of that painted area and continued to go I it it was just it was just very tough for him not to get a call and Booker meanwhile is the other end had a good look off that inbound couldn't convert Beal with his second personal foul B knocks down the first free throw is Eric Gordon comes into the ball game Phoenix trying to maybe figure out a way to get Devin Booker untracked with just seven points here as we approach the latter part of the third quarter from a player who averaged over 27 a game here yeah well every Everything has to be for him out on the perimeter where he beat somebody off the dribble or there's a high pick and roll except the defense at both ends have been taking away a lot of FReidom here tonight Durant with the ball two-man game with Eubanks Good Help by go the tip no good rebounded boy Rudy Gobert showed right there why he might be the defensive player of the year well let's face it now that should have been a dunk a catch in a dunk all it was an excellent pass by Durant Alexander Walker with the ball outside against Gordon Gobert Tribble hand off to Edwards likes going to his left spins right oh man he was in his bag like the fries were at the bottom Edwards the be the beauty the beauty of this play is once he pivots just watch how high up he gets on the release let's watch now once he now once he you're not stopping that baby after you make your defensive move okay time winding down in the third quarter Mark Jones court side with huie brown George Sedano as well there's a look at the cogent pertinent numbers of Anthony Edwards tonight during the regular season just 14.3 tonight 20 and the meter is still running huie he looks a lot more comfortable when he's deciphering the defense once he gets in the paint tonight if you've been really following him the defensive is taking away going to the ren on his reverse dribble and his spin move is where it's happening because his elevation is so high the defender who has to recover can't get up that high there's Booker go bear switches out onto him see if Booker can exploit this mismatch Gobert stayed with him Gordon with the pump fake three and go with the rebound rebound he was everywhere Alexander Walker across the midcourt line 14 rebounds for go Edwards this time KD picks him up what a Slams on the brakes Edwards nice fake and he won the foul but what a what a fake that was a fake and remember now the guy that's there is is Durant 610 611 or 7 big time that's right biggest lead of the ball game for Minnesota that comes off to O'Neale they'll have it another opportunity Booker has been conspicuous by his silence offensively working against Alexander Walker he draws the foul and will go to the free throw line trying to see the ball go through the basket now just think about this tonight you're talking about a guy who's averaging 27 points a game in Booker how many times have we seen him in an isolation or in a one-on-one where there's not a traffic jamp just think about it we're talking about a Quality quality guy here knocks down the first one as we take a look at tomorrow's playoff schedule on ABC and TNT ABC has Miami at Boston game one followed by Dallas at the Clippers at that's game on as well TNT has Indiana Milwaukee at 700 p.m. followed by the Pelicans at OKC at for one these games please go to nba.com or visit the NBA app let's go to George Jonesy hu as we inch closer to the fourth quarter here in Minnesota a regular season Trend to watch fourth quarter team plus minus this season the Suns minus 195 worst in the NBA in the fourth quarter the t-wolves plus 101 second best in the NBA I also have a Grayson Allen update right ankle spring questionable return Jonesy wow oh boy big shooter on the sidelines for now they could use a big shot from Booker but he comes off and Edwards will walk it across with under a minute to go in the third Durant trying to guard him Edwards around the double team got to look butter oh boy Ant-Man in full effect yeah he he's he's talking some trash to Durant as they're walking right in front of our table and that's an offensive foul against the Suns Frank Bogle is incensed Edwards has found his Mojo in his rhythm you don't need to detect the thr Edwards meanwhile has scored 11 of the last 15 even KD can't sit in his stance and stop him right now Eubanks with a hard hedge Edwards kicks it out to McDaniels had an ocean drives it one more Naz Reid for three go bear oh boy was held by Eubanks yeah no doubt about that that should have been a foul I'm glad to see the guy call it because he was about five 6 ft away Eubanks was draped all over Minnesota leading by 16 they've broken it open a little bit and interesting now to see Kevin Durant take on the assignment of Edwards yeah don't really that I mean it's a surprising but he he went out and and man oh man oh he looked at his wrist and said I got time today Anthony Edwards he has exploded here in the third quarter with 28 now now he is making some very big distant shots and he's reading the defense perfectly with Durant guarding him you don't see that very often especially out at the top of the three perd Circle but Durant continues to play it but the shot that he's making let's face it you and I both know come on they're they're far away you almost feel like you can reach out and touch him he's he's that far away from the basket sure is he'll be has 18 in the third quarter and Anthony Edwards said going into the series hey this is the matchup that I want Kevin Durant is my goat my greatest of all time and he wants to see what it's like to test himself against the best they can one run it down to one be picks him up this time they hit him with a double he gets it back sprays it to Alexander Walker everything is falling the lead is up to 20 what a quarter for the home crew Timberwolves Anthony Edwards pivoting with a display of Immaculate footwork go back to the NBA first round presented by ESPN bet we're here with Chris Finch the head coach of the t-wolves Anthony Edwards struggled against this team during the regular season only 14 points per game 28 through three quarters what do you make of this performance thus far yeah anyone who knows Anthony knows that he always rises in the occasion nothing's too big for him even though he's this young in his career and we knew he was going to come in with the right attitude to turn things around towns only his third game back off of injury what do you make of his performance tonight yeah I really think he's playing a great game you know we want to go to him want try to feature him as much as we possibly can when he's out there and he's making the right plays for us coach Finch good luck thank you thank you guys back to you lead down to 18 after that Royce O'Neale floater Anthony Edwards has deciphered that defense they hit him with a double team Nurkic came up to help nasri drives the close out by Booker out to Conley for three and it comes off that's going to be a foul against go his fourth personal foul just underway here in the fourth quarter yeah Conley's having a tough night tonight he's one for nine from the field but I think that uh as you look at this Phenix going to see that they're rotating eight guys they've scored eight points eight eight guys at the other end Minnesota is rotating nine guys they have 24 points this is big in a game like this with this kind of energy and when you're making moves nothing is happening for Phenix from the point Center the other guys not bad because Walker has 15 huge Off the Bench and add insult to injury Booker and the Suns down a man right now with Grayson Allen on the sidelines with the sprained ankle that gives Booker 13 lead down to 16 still plenty of basketball still plenty of time to go hooker hounding Conley they Blitz it on the pick and roll and Gobert gives it back got it back on the nice pass Good Help by Eric Gordon Gobert pleading that he was hit yeah now that it was a nice rotation from the opposite side oh contact and that is going to be a blocking foul on Conley well let me tell you the forearm by Gordon you're going to see this on the replay okay now the defensive man now makes a pretty good move we've been seeing this all night long now what now just watch now as the defensive man is there boom and you can see that arm come right up all right that right arm came right up into the into the skin area 64220 yeah that's got to hurt a little bit now we don't have fly weights here okay all right it'll be in that hyperbaric chamber after the game nice nage inside smoked the layup but he got fouled on it and he'll go to the free throw line for a couple of shots you and I go back to the first quarter remember the first quarter we kept saying that Bo Phoenix is getting into that painted area down into the defensive Circle but they're not scoring now this is another example of it it's a great play pick and roll you get the opportunity you got to make that that's got to be up and strong now who am I to tell this guy this guy's been working hard all night long okay there's so much of the Dirty Work for the Phoenix Suns as Monte Morris will come into the ball game for head coach Chris Finch and Conley picked up his fifth foul on that last whistle meric with 94 and three he pretty much right along the lines of his normal stat line points wise Edwards had 18 points in that third quarter and he brings it up against Beal now Reid set a GH screen and see on Edwards yeah even if you roll you're not going to be open because they rotate back it's like a a Zone in the back and they've been covering so that you don't get that layup nice pass go fouled by Nurkic yeah patient that time right huie they got with something good at The Rim that's right and what you like about it very quietly go bear who they run nothing for as we all know is is just having a very very nice game because he continues to work at both ends of the floor he's got 15 boards and he's got very quietly 10 points amongst League leaders in double doubles this year once again interesting that Rudy Gobert after last oh you've been working on that shot coach right in the aftermath of last year's playoff disappointment Rudy went to Southern Oregon and spent over two days alone in the woods a Darkness Retreat he called it and he said when they blow out the candle in your little cabin it's just you and your thoughts no phones no electricity no distractions it gave him a chance to reflect on his journey to the NBA and his present journey and where he is standing right now in the free throw line it said it was a great time for him to clear his head and go forward moving into this season knocked down the second free throw I don't know about no cable TV or leak pass for all that time but it is what it is 10 minutes to go in the fourth 17-point lead for Minnesota F lost the handle here's Naz Reid in transition oh what a step through Naz what a move what a move Naz Reid with some jelly at The Rim on the Finish picked it up off the steel little In-N-Out dribble timeout Suns play he came to play he certainly did he broke brought enough to feed the needy this afternoon the unassailable unimpeachable scoring of Anthony Edwards has been on full display scoring at all three levels he had that breakout third quarter 18 points the meter is at 28 and still running right now well you like the enthusiasm because once they took away the 10 to 15 foot area he made the threes which Loos everything up you got to give him a ton of credit he's played great all night long I know he's had the turnovers okay the negative people will be trying to well he had six so Durant up to 31 coach on that corner jumper the lead down to 16 Edwards walks it across under n and a half minutes to go in game one here Minnesota against Phoenix Gordon switches on to Edwards it is your trap again he's done a very good job in reading that and he got it to the right man Naz Reid firsters shooter 12 points for him well remember during the year six man in the year he's going to be right up in there average 13 and then rebounding and and an excellent three-point shoot that's out of bounds off of Kevin Durant Naz Reid with the back tap and it'll come back the other way the lead up to 19 Phoenix with 11 turnovers well you can't fall asleep now by that mean Minnesota you got to keep the engine running just don't let up Edwards against O'Neale passes out of the double Alexander Walker Reigns in another three will you believe this guy he's got 18 points Off the Bench 18 so that's 29 bench points to eight you talk about a difference Durant on the crossover out of bounds it's off of Minnesota one more look at pass out of the double here yeah now they the doubles have been quick All Night Long at both ends now this is just a guy who's having a terrific night having a great feel he's now four for seven from threes but more important 18 big points Off the Bench Booker from Deep rebounded by Edwards Finch calls out the play from the sidelines Edwards brings it across staring at the double team again over to Reid Gobert was calling for it Edward says I got this I got it all night long 247 he's up to 31 for the game he's four for seven in the three ball and like we said in the three losses during the year he struggled behind the line in the three game this is a different Anthony Edwards absolutely he's having a wonderful game but he's reading the defense Mark he's really Greening the defense perfectly here's go be crosscourt to Reid for three Edwards skies for the board McDaniels a little bit strong out of bounds off of Gobert Anthony Edwards with a big time rebound there telling you folks he is box office Reid got the steal at the other end and a turnover Phoenix you're seeing why this was the number one rated defense all year long pretty much Minnesota good active hands not only fewest points but also number one in field goal percentage against at 45 and then second in points in the paint and that's where the big separation in this game is also points in the paint off the turnover that's going to be a foul against Edwards with 709 to go Suns down by 25 that's just the fourth team foul Phoenix with a singular team foul here in the fourth quarter Edwards picked up his four that's the other thing about Anthony Edwards he will not duck number one or two offensive options at the defensive end Rudy moving his feet well yeah he sure did O'Neale for three laces and Royce O'Neale forces Chris Finch to call timeout he's got 11 in the ball game we're just under 7even minutes to go here in game one NBA first round is presented by ESPN bet the official sports book of ESPN you'd have to go back to 2004 to put a finger on the last time that Target Center shook the way it has right now the Timberwolves having their most successful season since Kevin Garnet was patrolling the paint here in Minneapolis and that young quazar of the Court Anthony Edwards is sitting perhaps a new standard here for the timberos 31 points four seven from De and Did we tell you he's only 22 years old out of the timeout Alexander Walker to Edwards O'Neale switches on to him Conley and rebounded by Durant 22-point lead for Minnesota Booker cash is out well he's having a tough night you know he's five for 16 now but also Conley at the other end is now one for 10 but you have to give the perimeter defenses the switching from the man to the soft zones and matching up not allowing you to get a good look so people have been rushing their shots in this game at both ends Alexander Walker coach missing on the heat check Edwards little machine gun dribble side step three audacity that time not rewarded comes off the rim Gordon pulls a quick three in transition and Edwards battles for the rebound go running the floor got clobbered by Booker and earns that trip to the free throw line for a couple of shots yeah you like the pass conally made a nice pass and then Gobert went over and slapped hands with him because a lot of times the big guys when they're running the paint to the paint you always want to reward them because this guy is working here tonight he's been a bear with the 16 boards okay uh you got to give them a ton of credit got to give those bigs a touch once in a while right get them to rebound and block that's right and and please do not miss them when they're open on the break never hey tomorrow it's the Stanley Cup playoffs with a couple of game ones on ESPN of the app the lightning square off against the Panthers at Eastern then the Rangers host Alex oin and the capitals the road to the cup rolls on Anthony Edwards went to the bench on that last whistle just under six minutes to go go with another impressive double double on the season and that's a lot of contact the foul will go against the timber BS Nickeil Alexander Walker who I mention has history with Coach Finch in New Orleans when finchy was was an assistant there under Alvin Gentry and when Alexander Walker joined the timberos in one of their early discussions he said you know I know what you can do I just want you to be a star in your role and just always know that whatever I say to you is coming from a place of love as a person and it's been a great time for that guy so far miniapolis boar will sit at 538 to go a 20-point lead for Minnesota Booker knocks down both I want to give gobear a little clap yes 14 points 16 boards not bad plus changed a number of shots in the painted area they've had some wonderful friendly banter between the USA Basketball guys on Minnesota team and Rudy go and Kyle Anderson who has played internationally for China as Royce O'Neale brings it into the front Court not to mention assistant coach Pablo Pion who represents Argentina for the timberwol here's Gordon one more to the corner O'Neale knocks it home yeah the ball movement at both ends tonight has been nice when the clock was going down everybody making the extra pass hey we got a dance on that one boy yeah hey an starting and starting to get it my boy hey he's starting to get it it's how you got to do it game one you got to go put that you know what I mean I think I saw an air fryer on that Minnesota bench because Anthony Edwards is cooking today having his way with Phoenix's defense 31 points eight rebounds six dimes last year against Denver in the first round the average a little over 31 points per game that team wasn't as healthy as this year's edition of Minnesota going into the playoffs Edwards isolated against Beal little reverse pivot oh played some bully ball and lost his balance deal saying that Edwards Used that free arm they'll be Baseline with four minutes to go JN just think of how many times tonight guys have taking it in the chest right defensively at both end yes the energy level that the both teams have been putting out there and then give Minnesota a ton of credit by dominating the pre points the fast break the second chance points in the paint they just outwork them in those areas but like you always say it's only one game right does matter we'll see who's forced to make the adjustment first we have a challenge on the court on the call back after this time to check out this week's playoff tracker brought to you by esbn bet Oklahoma City going to match up against New Orleans determin that the ball was last touched by Durant after gaining possession therefore challenge Minnesota would get the ball in the Baseline reset the shot clock to 24 and they receive their timeout back and they have an additional challenge thank you let take one more look at the call on the floor which was Phoenix basketball that clearly off of Durant what what about the guy that was hanging on Durant's uh arm right around the elbow is that what that was I mean that he was he was holding on through the entire replay there oh Minnesota basketball with 433 to go Timberwolves have not been out of the first round of the playoffs since the aforementioned 2004 O'Neale on Edwards have a full shot clock to work with Edwards against Durant on the switch little hesy move high off glass listen and Booker coming back Durant really played him well Cross Court O'Neale in Rhythm and Edwards with the rebound Anthony Edwards with his ninth board see both of these teams are not great three-point shooting attack teams both of them only do it 32 times a game and when you think about that they're ranked 23rd and 25th in three-point attempts so you know it's not like they're coming down and trying to shoot up 40 53 makes sense especially the guy with the ball here led the NBA in oh nice hands oh Edwards it's showtime room service all set up by Gobert Gobert made the first move Rudy Gober got a hand on that ball and Anthony Edwards yeah I just loved this defense this has been team defense all night long and then the explosion at the end this afternoon has been a magisterial dogmatic performance by five right there Anthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves he turned the Beat Around he averaged only 5 14 a game against Phoenix during the regular season in the three defeats but he seems to have cracked the code this afternoon as Frank vogle has emptied his bench with 320 to go well I think that he's read the traps much today probably than during the season because if you notice today he stopped on a dime turned around in the paint and shot the fadeaways time and time again now you know with the clock down so he's reading much better today than what possibly happened during those three games Phoenix going to be forced to adjust Phoenix as we look forward to game two we have a challenge of the call on the floor by the Phoenix Suns with 3 minutes and 20 seconds to go don't forget coming up next it's the Sixers and Knicks in that intriguing series boy what Jaylen Brunson has done this year in the absence of Julius Randle really speaks to his all NBA level of play and his ability to play off of two feet at the offensive end is really reap benefits for the Knicks replay of determined at the ball last touched Thomas's hip therefore is a successful the ball will be awarded to Minnesota we set the shot clock to 24 they do not get their time out nor do they have an additional challenge so Minnesota basketball without Replay that looks like it's off of the defender but hey approaching three minutes to go in the fourth two more games to go one on ESPN right after this one followed by ABC tonight Monte Morris now look that's the 34th point the bench has contributed 34-4 now this is this has to change in the rest of the series Josh aogi left that layup short short you cannot overstate the importance of Minnesota's bench and what they've produced at both ends of the floor back tap by Oki out of bounds I think when Minnesota looks at all of this they're going to see they dominated the paint they dominated the boards at both ends they got to the foul line they did a good job there but their trapping rotating and coverage has been excellent making some great offensive Shooters have difficult percentage games give them Credit Now J they they've been working here they earned it 's little inside with a tough bucket got it the B you know something that might slide by people through the cracks right now is the fact that Isaiah Thomas is on the floor for the Phoenix Suns signed a regular contract after attendee with the Suns late in the season great to see him back with a full deal in the NBA after going through a Litany of injuries a hip injury I want to say it was back in the day he was one of a explosive group of scores with the Celtics several years ago that you're right on that and it's nice that you brought that up because he was fantastic at Boston he had that City rolling and then they were winning big games and he was right in the middle of everything very happy to see him because he's overcome so many injuries like you said Log Road back hey if you're expecting to see Knicks and Sixers it'll be right up here in a moment but it's tipping off on ESPN 2 so you want to flip over there we won't have our feelings hurt Morris with 15 to go on the clock young guarding him 10 on the shot clock Morris nice pass nice pass and a nice move by the big fella on the Baseline Luka Garza with that last bucket the former college player of the year out of Iowa played alongside Keegan Murray of the Sacramento Kings as that ball knocked out of bounds by Thaddius young with under a minute to go Morris behind the Garza screen Luka got it if you're Timberwolves fan a wonderful way to put an exclamation point on the afternoon for that young guy that was further than downtown you shoot that thing oh that was right they're relaxed 27-point lead for the Timberwolves and a convincing vanquishing and victory today against Phoenix the number six seed josha Kobe on the break got it to fall there are a lot of people that feel that this is an upset alert type of series but Minnesota doesn't want to hear that today y it's been a blast oh it's been fun it's been fun because of the energy that first half was really fought hard on both men and I just don't want to see quality players get hurt let's hope that Allen will be able to come back and play game too so after two games so far this afternoon here's the updated brackets one of those games in the west Minnesota up one nothing on Phoenix don't forget on ABC later tonight nuggets and Lakers for huy brown and George Sedano I'm Mark Jones thanks for watching the NBA playoffs on ESPN up next 76ers Knicks Mike Green has the call with Doris JJ and Lisa Salters
