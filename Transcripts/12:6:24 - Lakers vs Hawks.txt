 the on in this one and score tipped up no unfortunate two first shots for the Lakers and an Anthony Davis trying to chase down Jalen Johnson you might recall a a throw down dunk he had on Austin Reaves last year and he shoots and scores from the outside from three in the first possession they got a little bit of defensive mismatch there and the Lakers weren't able to recover and ended up giving up an open three now Jalen turns 23 later this month really kind of came in into his own last year but taken it next level so far this season LeBron good numbers the other night and now losing effort although he didn't shoot the three particularly well either oh wide open in the key flashing there and getting the little jump shot was Rui Hachimura a good look by Rui just to make a flash into the post area and LeBron with the assist LeBron one of the top assist makers in the NBA fourth currently he's behind of course Trae young whose shot is just not going down but that's what he does he dishes down low and the reverse layup is no good that's what Anthony Davis does is make you alter your shot LeBron outside got it for three so he hits his first triple of the evening hopefully that's a good sign and keep the Lakers offense off to a good start and I think it helps to put the energy in their defense that was his best shooting game since the 30th of October couple of nights ago as that's a block but in his postgame interview the other night he knows they did not play well at all he talked about ownership both on the coaching staff and the players on the floor very familiar face right there Quinn Snider qu's been a head coach a couple of places now in the NBA and a former Laker assistant and Quinn has them Ste playing really good defense he's got him playing really good basketball all the way around I mean across the board uh they're really performing quite well defensively though they here in the top 10 LeBron pull up from three looking for two in a row in and out no rebound fell right into the lap of Trae young his pass goes just beyond the reach of Anthony Davis oh all the way gliding up and in with Jalen Johnson remember he went to Duke for a season then they steal it Trae young they dodged one there because that's the Trae Young specialty there is dribbling into an open three yeah this team number two in steals number two in deflections and the number one man in that department is Dyson Daniels he came over in a trade the dejon Murray trade look at this fake by Rui and he lays it up in a same play made when LeBron got the first to see fake and ends up with a layup yeah Rui double digits and three straight the beginning of games has not really been a problem for the Lakers it's been closing in the second half Capela's underneath and tight space nearly traveling looked like he did they didn't call it now to the outside once again Trae young I mean wide open if he's ever going to hit one it's going to be now and he didn't that's kind of his shooting game in a nutshell right there Capela good defense Again by Anthony Davis well that's a good defensive sequence cuz they gave up two or three shots on that one possession Trae young was old for nine from three the other night and knocking it down as Dalton connects Bo it's nice driving kick by Gabe spotten up was Knecht Trae AR start at 0 for two so that's 0 for 11 now over the last two games had a notion instead it's h for Capela they'll turn and store well they had the mismatch they switched and had Capela being guarded by Gabe Vincent who gives up quite a few inches here come the Lakers ninth in the west currently again losing their last two stepping into a three Anthony Davis a little bit too long chance for the break and the Lakers are going to hustle back now this is Daniels where they miss him in New Orleans and they were really talking about him when we were down there he's underneath he puts it over Anthony Davis and Stor he does a lot of things well and here's the deal he's getting an opportunity to play here well what he does really well is defense first he he can flat defense yeah first in steals first inod dund D we were talking to Steve Holan the radio voice long time radio voice of Atlanta that's what he calls him I like that don't you like that crocodile d d oh how a block that time by Capela yeah that time Knecht showed the ball way too early another block by LeBron and at the other end wide open for Anthony Davis good play by LeBron he saved the sh two points and then gets an assist on the play and the Lakers grab a what was the number 33 38 something like that it was a lot yeah pretty crazy stuff Lakers three of their last five Atlanta two of their last six oh wow not going to get it much easier than that yeah I mean out of a timeout they they executed perfectly as rashay underneath boy he has really improved from the beginning just getting to know the NBA game is Zaccharie the number one pick he's doing all the things that they hope that he would do re a and now he is going to stay out there as Jalen Johnson comes out and DeAndre Hunter who has been a starter off the bench a starter again now he's off the bench for this team of course won a title with Virginia couple of years back good players Ste yes he is he's averaging 19 Off the Bench that one's are well short boy ad's shooting woses have been well documented the last couple of games and I still think it's something to do with that plan of fasciitis you know your shooting starts with your legs and obviously your feet are a major part of that you can't elevate it affects your shot yeah season loone scoring two straight seven for his last 28 Knecht trying to make a couple of early buckets he had one a moment ago try young into the front Court one way then the other Drew contact didn't get the whistle though and Knecht saves it the Lakers have a chance with the break middleman is LeBron bouncing now over to Rui Hachimura for three count it you see Rui catch it look down to see if his foot was behind the line and then drill to three Rui Hachimura three for three one of those is a three and he has seven of the Lakers 15 points there's the switch that they didn't want as now it's Gabe Vincent guarding Capela in the paint out of his five game winning streak they beat Cleveland twice remember Cleveland is only lost 12 and 10 as we stand here tonight will not be in look at that intimidation by Anthony Davis oh my goodness nobody loves to challenge Back Door Max his air it got deflected but he got it anyway D'Angelo Russell by the way is in the game as you just saw yeah he gets the assist on a nice little back cut by Max Christie Trae young for the usage rate for him least how much he holds on to it pretty amazing don't run it through him all the time all the way Daniels Drive kick three rattled home for that's the name of the NBA these days drive and kick for three the big fell R who's 6-9 in the number one overall pick the last two number one overall picks have both been from France number two pick this year Alex SAR also from there with one they're not going to get it away and they're going to call it 24 seconds violation see any ingame changes that the Lakers will make here tonight underneath there it is Anthony Davis again all too easy in the basket from Dalton Dalton did a good job of keeping it in the middle of the floor to run the break properly and they take advantage of Atlanta's first turnover Hunter that's DeAndre hitting a three turned 27 years of age last week four out of the last five games he scored at least 20 in the other game he scored 18 so that's the consistency still was alluding to with Hunter lob underneath count very low as Davis can't finish it now it's going to be four on four the other way because Hunter and ab got tangled up a little bit young backing up that's good pass on got Okongwu yeah that time D'Angelo got caught on his him and tried to front in the low post you can't front there now you know about Okongwu he played at SC also on the same Chino Hills team with all three of The Ball Brothers back in the day got it Anthony Davis nothing but net it's a soft shot for Anthony Davis they gave him space worried about that dribble ability that he has Here Comes Atlanta they're going to be in The Knockout round for the NBA Cup starting next week against the Knicks in New York the Hawks have Bogdanovic comes in this is a guy that can really get it going just remember that three-point buzzer beater over Tyson Chandler back in 2018 in Sacramento that's all you got to remember in and out does not go back in again and D'Angelo Russell trying to lob it for they're just 80s getting under there tonight at State Farm Arena right next to the football stadium going to have a heck of a game tomorrow there Georgia and Texas a lot of those folks obviously most of them in count some of them here at the game tonight boy underneath it's what they call V domage into the corner that's going to be way long weak side rebound taken by Rui here come the purple and gold and wearing that purple and black uniform tonight the Lakers and that was not a good pass by D'Angelo Russell good thought but it was kind of a shov bounce Behind The Man by Bogdanovic on its way that's good offensive rebound by a con they get a first 14 that's a travel come to a twoot jump stop there off the dribble they've been Atlanta's missed their last four and what the Lakers are doing St they're getting out and running a lot of it has to do with defense they're 10 two in transition right now yeah that's a very important fact that the Lakers can get out and run it's easy to run when you get a couple of stops Knecht straightway three long shot long rebound they'll let it go outside for a team rebound of course a little bit of double motivation for this Atlanta team was listening to Brian windhorse ESPN Radio in LA on the Sedano with cap show yesterday and you know he was reminding everybody that BS on Christie Lakers on the floor we've got D'Angelo Russell a reddish LeBron and Max Bogdanovic goes right round oh and he had the layup instead he kicked it out out for three and to beat the clock they get a two anyway wow I mean it wasn't Anthony Davis under there yeah well sometimes just the presence of Anthony Davis on the floor can make people change their mind saw purple uniform he figured it can't be D'Angelo and he hits a mid-range jump shot D'Angelo Russell that time they missed conre open on the other end back to the bench after two straight starts hanging on to it we're going to look down that defense that's a great help defense by cam that's why Cam's here grae tried to throw it underneath and he turned it over ham started here yeah as an NBA couple of years original draft pick of Atlanta Davis boy Lakers standing around standing around with two with one Davis the only thing he could do not a good possession for the lake show well the Lakers didn't help him his teammates didn't move to give him an outlet Rob and they can't jam it home that's about as easy a lob in a jam as you're going to get all he had to do is pass it to him not not lob just pass to he was wide open so a bit of a comedy of errors LeBron yes sir so a couple of Threes can we put that three-point shooting slump to rest as you say a couple of games don't to actually put you in one game doesn't put you out but he was out putting in his work there's another play where the Anthony Davis made them change their mind and they end up with the long ball would you say that Bo's an uh oh guy when he gets going I wouldn't call him an uh oh guy he's not in my category yet he played with Sacramento for three seasons lean just hanging on to it not moving at all finally got into his action going to be a foul so it's going to go out of bounds yeah we've had nine lead changes and six ties in this game so far shot clock is off LeBron surveys gives it off now to D LA to Anthony Davis he had to come back down to Earth but then he threw it down and was fouled what a silly fight Carl Jr trying to complete the three-point opportunity and the 78 percenter knocks it down they've got two six if they can get it to midcourt quickly and that's where defensively you don't want him to make the first pass oh and then DeAndre Hunter just threw it up he might have had a couple of dribbles in him Atlanta was just two of their last eight before that bucket right there pretty good ball protection for both teams three turnovers for each Lakers have made Seven of their last 11 as we start the quarter you've got reddish you talked about going to the bench lot of bench right now for the Lakers you got Russell Traore reddish Christie the only starter is LeBron and they bring it back and lay it in it's a nice semi Break by the Hawks re a with on the shoulders of LeBron with no Anthony Davis or Rui in the game now Gabe is in so what you got is five or four in here is LeBron just kind of weaving his way through and scoring the layup and the other end boy they took it right out of the net took no time that's what teams do I mean they don't let you celebrate at all they just take it out and run Lakers got to be cognizant of that fact Lakers do it to the opposition quite a bit LeBron mid-range glances off the rim taken by the Atlanta Hawks with a record of 12 and 11 they're sixth in the Eastern Conference they started the year four and seven they're battling it back where LeBron nearly lost it once did lose it on the second try now it's a two-on-one good night I thought yeah I thought LeBron had that one for sure he just couldn't get complete control of it LeBron front Court going to be entangled up there with Jalen Johnson they'll swing it for Max for three Christie boy double digits in four of his last seven every other game if you want to look at it that way too easy they're throwing him down I'd say that's too easy yeah no resistance they've got the court nice and spread Gabe going to let it fly Lakers down by two Atlanta's biggest lead three the Lakers biggest lead four yeah it's been that close if you're just joining us first quarter action from Atlanta the end of the road trip Lakers will be home on Sunday to Face Portland High over the head Traore is in very deep he can't finish it though rebound thought he should have kept coming and used his left hand he spun back to the defender the weave out on top great play by reddish reddish took it away he was there with Traore arml all the way can't finish again so he's been very deep in a great place to finish just hasn't been able to do it and once again at The Rim making the Lakers pay for those Miss bunnies now points in the paint 22 already for the Atlanta Hawks they are the second best team in the league scoring points in the paint so not that surprising Jor has tried three field goals none have gone down look how fast they're into the painted area C could have laid it in again but that's the NBA now you're not looking to lay it in it's the driveing kick yeah reverse layup is no good they could had the easiest two in the world but now the Lakers will come back the other way LeBron holding on to it we'll see if the starters start trickling back in a couple of minutes well it depends on if they can score on this trip down and Lebron k LeBron L behind the back and then Johnson hits the bottom of the rim that was a nice looking play till the end great move points in the quarter a three for four shooting Lakers with possession they are down by four the biggest lead of the game for the Hawks and a bron little Baseline move and he set Okongwu off for that one and LeBron four for seven as he was a robust 12 for 18 the other night made all four of his free throws in 29 minutes again the Lakers losing by a combined 70 points the last two game last time that even came close to happening was in 201617 Bogdanovic well that's going to be a long rebound off of a long shot yeah that's a tough one to take cuz the Lakers didn't do anything wrong for that one catch and shoot again nobody in the league has fear of shooting Let It Go from any yeah what a coach is going to tell you it's a bad shot there's no there's no bad shots in the NBA these days first of two meetings this year we'll see this team first week in January in La Dalton's got his third bucket see that's what I like to see him come off of a semi screen they back off and he he's got a great mid-range game he's not only a spot up three-point shooter can I say third bucket that's his second he's two out of five he did have a three earlier little Up and Under then over and then hitting the hardwood and going down is Daniels see there's no Anthony Davis so they don't really have to worry about uh the rim protection as much averaging about 33 and A2 minutes a game shot by r r continues to score he's four for four from the field all right listen Rui came in making 14 straight shots from inside the ark 14 he's made three from inside the arc so 17 straight two point shots for Rui have gone down that's an incredible streaks still yeah that's that's healthy that's pretty amazing LeBron the turn and he can't score and he's going to shoot free throws LeBron free throw time LeBron this year a 76% free throw shooter remember a couple years ago on his 38th birthday he dropped 47 here in a game also a rebounds nine assists in that Laker win hey Laker fans tacos are on the line this game if the Lakers win you know what you're going to score a couple of three tacos with a drink purchase from Jack In The Box tomorrow Mike trudell what you got you're down down there again with a better seat than us you seem obsessed with that and something You' like to discuss I would switch with you any time no Billy especially if I got to sit next to Stew anyway can I get to the report now or we yeah uh so you mentioned the about Rui Hachimura Billy and how great he's been from two ironically to start the season he was hitting everything from three and could not buy a bucket at The Rim so it just goes to show you you have to be careful about the sample size as Bogdanovic hits again uh Rui's always been a great finisher he's always had a nice little mid-range game so just kind of ignore the first 15 games of this season he's getting back to what he's used to it's like it never happened here's LeBron from the outside LeBron's got another three andon LeBron's getting back to where he used to be CS this season is shooting the ball effectively from the three-point L the lob underneath Trae young picks up the assist to Capela you're so right LeBron it was his best start to a season from downtown for the first 3 four weeks of the Year well he is just bullying yeah that is a pure bully move that is just bully ball there boy that is just bully ball he bounced theun twice telling you he he wants to silence all the noise that has been shend doing about his game and about his career over the team in fact they allowed the most field goals three-point field goals made in the entire NBA in fact they're on Pace to allow the most ever in the history of the game as they score now out of the Timeout on mid-range so if they're vulnerable it's on the three-point line that time DeAndre Hunter over the top of Knecht for the 16-footer they've made what their last four shots Lakers have made their last six shots so everybody hot right now LeBron back to the bench for his rest right after being four out of six and 11 points in the quarter you've got 44 remaining in it D gets a hand on it and out of bounds it goes that was a good read by Dalton he almost games taking place tonight in the NBA little shake and bake by Hunter splits to the fence that would have counted they all help him up and then he'll be shooting two free throws and up by three with 409 remaining Hunters played nine minutes scored five points as an assist and a rebound so far the fouls on D'Angelo Russell and we've got a second and Hunter checked the basketball for a moment let's hear about this from Kia WI off a bit and then he drains the first of two along with Brandon Ingram turnover so the Lakers Give It Away points off of turnovers have been a real problem can see Trae young he's just not looking to shoot like he used to maybe he'll start feeling a little bit better about things here he is a little floater and that misses Trae young still ice cold he's one for five tonight Anthony Davis was open trying to work on Qui Capela there goes the double team by DeAndre Hunter here's the it was clear and conclusive by the replay official that Davis for La calls the ball to go out of bounds off his leg therefore the challenge is successful Atlanta will retain their timeout and also the opportunity for a second challenge it'll be Atlanta Basketball on the Baseline with 24 and the shot clock all time and three-pointers made JJ Reck and interesting and I'm sure a lot of you know the opposing coach Quinn Snider also went to Duke Trae young in the attacking 47 there's the switch that they don't want bounce underneath in very deep attacking Max and we'll get a foul and free throws upcoming for Jalen Johnson will Jalen Johnson you know any category you want he's going to give you production every single night how about this right now from Stu favit Sprite not successful on the first free throw attempt as LeBron enters the game for the final 317 we've got Rui D'Angelo Russell LeBron Christie Davis Dalton Knecht goes to the bench Jalen 69 20 points good rebounder too obviously 15th in the league really good on the defensive end rebounding he'll grab him for you into the corner Maxwell up fake nobody find there he's working on young he likes that match up then he hits kind of an umbrella defense and as we mentioned Trae young picks up the foul team fouls three for Atlanta three for the Lakers hey happy holidays Laker fans looking for the perfect gift well here's what you do the team's newest City Edition uniform the California Destiny is on sale right now it's the first time a jersey says Lakes show across the chest it's a must have shop now at lakers.com lakersstore spread that Lake Show cheer one out of two for Max Lakers now five Lakers on the night that was their first Miss from the free throw line they're four for five wide open three in the corner they're a pretty good three-point shooting team in the corner but they're not good what they call above the break they're one of the better mid-range shooting teams in the NBA good bounce Capela blocked by Davis got a deflection on there Clint Capela what a match for him here tonight Anthony Davis his defensive chops he came to play but then he couldn't get it and a fumble and we got bodies on the floor there a power play going the way oh LeBron's going to take a charge again anybody can do it Davis do you think that's a directive from JJ do you think he just took it upon himself how do you think Anthony Davis is on the line right now just Anthony Davis went to the line said I'm taking it just like that said I'm the best free throw shooter on this floor right now don't talk to me fellas it's mine what is what is D'Angelo shooting from the free throw line see as a guard I would have told Anthony Davis no you got that's why I'm asking I said you know no no that's mine Anthony Davis 78% but it's usually the best percentage shooter at that time Anthony Davis boy the little swing in the hook for Davis nice by so he comes back and turns it over and the Lakers have they have a chance to Tire actually take the lead and ads on the ground eyes Nik uh tight throughout hey on the next episode of Backstage Lakers Austin Reaves details his love of golf he's going to compete in the celebrity tournament up in uh Lake to the 2024 American centry so don't miss backstage Lakers Sunday the typical rule right is the guy who has the highest percentage on the core but if you have a player and especially a star lever player uh who either feels that they are in a rhythm or needs to get into one sometimes that can be superseded right so Anthony Davis or or Lebron can kind of look over the teammate and say hey I'm going to take this one and usually they don't get much of an argument yeah makes sense it's just kind of curious with d out there so well you know sometimes it depends too you know if it's a guy that hasn't shot a lot of free throws during the I see Gabe getting up you know who went down and got him was Scott Brooks Scott Brooks obviously knows the foul situation he just went down there and said Gabe you're going on that bench two free throws by Trae Young and the Hawks go back up by a douche Tre young averaging 202 points a game and 12 assists he has at least five plus assists in 183 straight games it's the third longest in the history of the league there is Vincent the clean up throw it down big fella Anthony Davis with the dunk I mean throw it high off the glass I think Gabe knew that Anthony Davis was there for the rebound I don't know if that was an intentional type Miss by away Trae young has nine assists so you can at another nine per Center he's been struggling a little bit with the achilles tendonitis but again a strange year career low and field goal percentage three-point percentage and the lowest points per game since his rookie season and he's in his seventh year but you know the 12 assists of gamees to yeah that's the highest for anyone anyone since John Stockton was averaging 12.3 at this stage in 1994 95 it's not where you are now it's where you end up with just saying I love all these stats that come out after 10 games he scored more points than anybody in history know that's where he is at now stocked in that 12.3 that was at the end of the year okay well that makes a difference so let's see where Trae is at the end of the year all we're saying is he's up there and Anthony Davis scores so both Anthony Davis and LeBron kind of back on point tonight shooting AB 8 for 13 LBJ 6 for nine and we're tied again 10th time we've been tied trying to break it that time was the three-pointer both teamside Jalen Johnson excuse me both teams uh at the 60p point mark for the half so not a whole lot of Defense being played again running it right through Davis Look Out Below boy just making it look easy with that bad wheel Mak looking for this six win on the road and also to go to 500 against the East DeAndre Hunter Second Chance opportunity on the long rebound on the Miss from Trae young DeAndre Hunter knocks it down here comes LeBron with a pedest drive kick swing it g got it great ball Movement by the lake show at the other end got to get back and it's going to be a blocking foul yeah I think Gabe was in the restricted area blocking foul caught on the play see they're calling this a restricted area well it's definitely not restricted area beats the offensive player to the spot gets his torso in a squared up position prior to the upward motion and absorbes illegal contact in the Torso therefore the call has been overturned to an offensive foul the challenge is successful La will receive their timeout back and also the opportunity for a second challenge I they can utilize quite a bit of it and make the Hawks uh throw up something a little bit faster than they want you know we saw a lot of in the quarter totally different for the Hawks here in the second nine different Hawks have scored in the second quarter they spread it around D he misses I thought they took that too quick there was only a 6sec differential when they got possession and then when they took the shot it was 15 seconds and Atlanta now can work for the last shot maybe take the lead or they're going to tie it tie it at 64 Lakers was still 3 seconds Anthony Davis to LeBron and Gabe going to get a look at it no too late never left his hand in time to late start looking to do on a pick and roll is especially with Trae young is blitzing making pick up their drill if they're going to don't switch it as much have to big step out double team him and then get back you know over the past 12 days uh the Lakers have endured four blowout losses of 25 or more four blowout losses in the last 12 days and the common theme on each of those two and we've talked about it is a bad third quarter uh they've been outscored by a staggering 59 points in the third quarter in those four games well to start the third quarter of this one they give up an easy yeah easy Duce to Trae young so you know for the most part the offense has been there for good portion of the year except for recently and to some degree I think the Lakers defense is tied to their offense Dalton Knecht knock it down when they're knocking down shots their defense is a little better because they don't have to you know get back in transition quite as bad as much Lakers 20th and three percentage it is Jalen Johnson runs over Gabe Vincent another look at the pass from LeBron to or excuse me to Anthony Davis to G Dalton Knecht who does what he does best and that's put the beats the offensive player to the spot as a defense offensive player brings the ball from his right to left commits illegal contact to the facial region of the defender therefore the challenge is unsuccessful call on the floor stands as offensive foul Atlanta will be charged to timeout lose their ability to challenge for the remainder of the game before he gets uh in a shooting motion motion we can probably get the call no more challenges for the Atlanta Hawks Knecht looking for his second three of the quarter rebound offensively Rui going to get it right back from LeBron he still hot try it again is he still hot Rui hasn't missed literally hasn't missed I mean he could say that but it it it's the truth he is a perfect five for five another turnover by the Hawks Lakers a chance to add to their four-point advantage Rui hit two threes out of that five for five that long streak that is at 17 in a row from two-point country underneath Dalton hangs in the air and scores good start to the quarter nice nice job of delaying the release by Dalton good start to the quarter has them up their largest lead of the game it's half a dozen Trae young once again I mean there was a time when he would launch that 28-footer in a moment's notice now he is thinking twice about it rebound tapped around taken by the Lakers see if they can turn things around completely in the third quarter tonight this would be a huge win if they could just continue this LeBron oh off a one leged just let's fly with a one leged three-pointer The Crowd Goes wild as we talked about a lot of Lakers fans here and the Lakers go up by now he's going to pop up a three and he's going to hit it that's why I say when he comes off the screens he's not very tall so you can give him space and just go ahead and Blitz him make him pick up his dribble and then get back 7769 as LeBron has it in the attacking zone so Atlanta hit their first shot missed a shot then had three straight turnovers then they hit one again tapped up and in by Anthony Davis ad is having his way on the inside Lakers are six for seven in the quarter from the field wide open three they'll trade three for two DeAndre Hunter that's what the drive and kicks do they make the defense collapse and then the perimeter usually is wide open again averaging 21.8 over this five game winning streak good pass finish of course the secure Anthony Davis Gabe read that pick and roll perfectly waited for Capela to commit and make the pass uh played 17 solid minutes Capela trying to lose hamur on the outside Bogdanovic can't he's going to stay in driv and kick Daniels Daniels has not made his mark on this game at all really when you think about it he can change the tone of a game on this end defensively and he hasn't really done it yet 88172 he's guarding LeBron who's had the best them Davis three Trae thought somebody else was going to get it voluntarily went and got it Hunter good look and he finishes it Mark it down DeAndre Hunter and JJ doesn't want this Atlanta by the way they have the MLB allstar game here next July just another major event that this city hosts LeBron two big steps and has it stolen now to the right hand side again that's Hunter out of bounds it goes it remains with the Hawks something that wasn't bad transition defense by Gabe again he's working against basically a two on one or so and he does a good job of preventing and in the quarter Atlanta four for six that was knocked out of bounds catch shoot bogey no you have a foul yeah in the act of shooting really got him it's tough when you're make him think about it like really that's going to be three free throws all right now this from BMW find the per bogdanovic what was it was 7766 just a couple of minutes ago now it's 81 to 77 it's Bogdanovic makes two of the three by the way 100 straight games now with the three for Bogdanovic he's the fif fifth ever to reach 100 straight games with three that's select company and now all of a sudden this game has turned around opportunity to get even closer and it's Bogdanovic tough shot ball away jump shot not going to get the bounce and Anthony Davis clears the board oh Trae young does steal it and tries a three got it well when you're throwing a pass a excuse me a pass almost from the Baseline to the midcourt it stays in the air quite a long time that's called not hesitating by Young it's a one-point game Vincent they can take the lead how long ago were the Lakers up 11 not too long ago 7766 Bogdanovic Drive kick young again that dipped in and came out strong rebound by Knecht he's fouled by game Vincent LeBron going to get a pick by Anthony Davis they're just waiting on it Daniels look at him he's reaching in LeBron's got to be really careful Vincent with two to shoot that wasn't a bad that wasn't a bad defensive sequence by the Hawks is just Gabe made a good hoop boy B donov just feeling it never hesitated Lakers up by one walking it into the attacking for 47 for the visiting Lakers looking for their 13th win of the Year trying to stop this two game lost in a row on the road Gabe another assist yeah Gabe playing a real nice game and that time Bogdanovic turned his head Baseline and paid the price that's four assists for Gabe Vincent D Knecht is in double figures in so let's give you the five on the floor Dalton Knecht Anthony Davis D'Angelo Russell

are going to oh the officials are going to look at each other and they're going to determine he goes out for a rest as LeBron comes in for the final two minutes oh by the way in points and in rebounds also Anthony Davis the leader of the purple and gold alone on the right wi side with six to shoot it's LeBron LeBron with CI in front of him and B donov comes over too late look at Spry and young is LeBron James tonight that was a tough shot CU When he shot it he basically was almost behind the plane of the board they battle underneath picked up by James good block by Christie LeBron long three oh that was caught up on the rim yeah that's the uh Court attendant uh responsibility how much that affected the shot right to the bottom of the well again this five-game winning streak for Cleveland started with back-to- back wins or for Atlanta back to- back wins over Cleveland excuse me LeBron with the foul LeBron saying he wasn't in the act of shooting and the official says I'm giving him two anyhow no basket though the crowd here with the Lakers show up tell you and it's nice too CU Atlanta's playing good basketball so they're coming in tonight there what and they've got cup fever they just beat Milwaukee and sna the Bucks seven game winning streak there was a Wisconsin native Jalen Johnson who was the really shining star in their last game Johnson tonight for them has 10 points he's one of five in double figures for Atlanta LeBron into the corner cam well he's having a tough shot I mean a tough time offensively cam reddish purpose is in he'll play 14 minutes won't take a shot yeah reddish is over for 10 now uh in his last 92 minutes that's a drought GR the one Leger there it is again not this time tapped and kept Alive by Rui D yes D with almost a logo Trae young get out of his hands and he gets it back so what are you going to do with him now the leader and assist in the NBA has it and they are again they're surrounding them and they bail him out there was only 2.9 on the clock the Lakers uh they sit at 26th in the league of 30 for second half net r when you're looking at all kinds of numbers thrown into the equation look at that 17 minutes bench points 14 for the Lakers uh they're getting just hammered in that department though 43 for the ATL Max with three with two and the quarter LeBron at the buzzer is this going to count it does Ry oh that's gay no that's cam cam finally is a going to counter Bound by the man that blocked it a conu a moment ago first possession for the Atlanta Hawks first of two meetings between these two this year tapped up and in by a conu who's everywhere so far in the quarter we've only played 2 second that's why was joking about it it's it's been all him in the first 20 seconds how about another rebound but Rui with his first Miss by the way Trae young had 15 in the third quarter there's a number one overall pick missing a three Lakers just shot two of their last nine to end the third Atlanta was two for their last 11 Lebron down the middle they steal it they stripped them clean one two got to be a travel got to be it's a turnover no matter what it is now at the other end L Jam this Crow stands on their feet when LeBron through that one D all these leg what was going on at this end I don't well I don't know what he was thinking he was fumbling around we do know that buck donovic runs into D offensive foul Laker lead is only three with the basketball mid-range D'Angelo rebound Jalen Johnson on the night that's his fifth rebound to go along with six assists and 10 points points Bogdanovic that's bogy yeah he great job with a drop step did a good job with his left hand he missed 13 straight games earlier this year with a hamstring they had injury problems just like everybody else earlier in the year now they're healthy and that's why they have turned things around with this winning streak Christie with a nice little move it just couldn't get it to go down great long in lanky Reet then gives it underneath it was almost like ret lost control at the very end but then gathered it laid it in with the left nice play Zaccharie Risacher and number one pick out of France followed up Countryman Victor wanyama who was number one last year and Alex SAR who is number two to Washington this year well they swing it all the way to LeBron and attacks the goal and with the soft touch it finds the bottom of the well did a good job of avoiding the he did a good job Laker just giving up easy hoop yeah and that's what it's all about defense yeah but here comes Anthony Davis again so those easy layups like that will be altered a bit well as long as you get back defensively that was just one of those where they just bolted down the floor Lakers down by a point and a foul out on the perimeter that's good basketball comes back in for the Hawks probably if they figure he's their best answer for Anthony Davis which hasn't been much in this one again yeah 11th year for Clint Capela three to shoot two to shoot one to shoot Anthony Davis throws up a prayer forced to shoot that Fall Away how many times do the Lakers get caught up against the shot maybe or or when it's ringing for half a dozen at least tonight seems like every possession but at least half a dozen that they're firing up right at the buzzer spinning LeBron going to go to the free throw line you know over his last eight games leimer shooter now how about this right now from mango Jess hilarious is hilarious it up with the first chance to go ahead by one still a lifetime left in this in this game 8 minutes and 12 seconds 24 lead changes in case you're wondering that's a lot in an NBA again that is quite a quite a few yeah doesn't normally happen like that that's a lot of KNE changes Trae young left wing bogie time out really really effective Atlanta 5 for eight Lakers just two for n they're down by only three Atlanta's biggest lead has been six oo that's a big time take Christie blocked that time out by Capela and quickly now into the Lakers Zone and surve and keeping the dribble is Young with Gabe Vincent in front of him Bogdanovic wants it cuz he wants to shoot it I mean badly he's not going to though there's three seconds is two and the Lakers take it away broken up broken up by Gabe Anthony Davis l and return a favor Anthony Davis normally the recipient this time the assist to Dalton Knecht most centers love to be in a position to make plays like that they just don't have most centers don't have the ball handling skills of Anthony Davis Anthony Davis with only a 20o career average against Atlanta the only other team that he averages lower against is Toronto so he's blown right which is a nice Improvement averaging just four and a half over his last three games he shoots much better at home than on the road but tonight 6 out of 11 ooh cross over by Young goes right past Davis but too hard yeah Anthony made him alter that shot Bo LeBron was attacking one on four still basically there they've got a box in front of him taken away bounce Trae Young no not a great shot again give Dalton credit for hustling back back and creating ADV B Le on the other end he can't score we got a lot of breaks and a lot of Miss layups maybe that's why they settle for threes like this right here got much easier right much easier and they go up by four on Bogdanovic three-pointer he has four threes Hunter has four threes young has four threes the Lakers take a time out with oh five of their last eight Bogdanovic in the quarter eight points three for three overall as AB misses and two for two from three for Bob donovich now the Lakers come back out with Knecht Vincent Rui ab and Max Trae young high off the window they battle for it and Rui secures it that's why that's why you want to force Trae young to go inside where the trees are kick it to Max little ball ad's got it if you want it from the top of the key now closed out by compeller six to shoot here they go they're at it again up against it it's Anthony Davis this time he drives to the hole well he seems like he could do that at whe but they're forced him to do it with a short clock getting to it get it to him with 12 or 14 on the clock then you got a chance to maybe get a second chance opportunity so you know what I I told you I was talking to Dominique ro Okongwu s at halftime he says I think Anthony Davis can get to the baset anytime he wants he's echoing what you were saying hey fans we've enter the final 5 minutes of the game brought to you by mangu Casino Resort in spot by two Trae young deliberate with it out on the perimeter the bounce and that is a very risky pass Lakers unfortunately can't get it Johnson fires it up from distance it's going to be Laker basketball and that dead ball allows LeBron time to get to the scores table and it's under five minutes within what five points and that's where we're at right now 108 106 this is where heroes are made stars shine it's LeBron over now for Rui back to the basket Anthony Davis LeBron will try a three and hit a three and the Lakers are back combined for 60 two 32 for Anthony Davis 30 for bra now you got to play defense this is going to make a break the last four minutes and the Lakers going a stop right here what a bad shot by DeAndre Hunter though being guarded by a shorter Defender and he shoots that well last game Lakers were five for 22 from three tonight they're 13 for 30 Gabe over the top of that same DeAndre andon of course he played minimal time last year for for the Lakers minimal well Gabe catches the pass from LeBron I don't know how he stayed on the floor cuz his heels if they go down would have touched the Baseline then he shoots over top of the DeAndre Hunter who challenges but 70 Laker run ooh and LeBron knocked over DeAndre who they're rooting for they're roaring right now Rui knocks it out of bounds what a good job of using your hands above your head by the guy guarding the man out of bounds got the good def ction don't just allow him to pinpoint any pass three-point game they've got Hunter Okongwu Johnson young and Daniels on the floor Hunter blocked but fouled I Believe by Anthony Davis another Hawk hits the deck that's young Around the Horn comes Daniels that's the 6 one on Christie I believe yeah he was the guy guarding DeAndre I thought we'll see now Hunter free throw time and the Lakers the adrenaline flowing a little too much in so that's an uncommon occurrence it's more like it for him two-point game 315 to play these are a lot more fun those last foul to vinent maybe G binon I think St here is LeBron LeBron down the middle puts two guys in the popcorn machine and he picks up a foul from the Lakers first opportunity it's LeBron and he rolls it in you know the Lakers they've lost a couple of games this year via the free throw late kind of started this six out of eight slide you know the Lakers had won six in a row prior to that and bronze got them both Lakers go up by four under three minutes to play Young quarterbacks The Possession trying to get around Vincent does not Christie still out there with five fouls he's guarding Hunter again Hunter's going right at him all the way scores boy and Hunter's talking to the Laker bench the coaches trust me anybody that will listen trust me the Laker bench is talking to him too yeah anybody that'll listen all right which team's defense is going to be the best in the final two minutes by the way we're going to see these guys in three weeks in Los Angeles Davis free throw line got to get a bounce does not ons out the rebound it's only a two-point game now this where try are they making you pick it up a bit now they're going into two-point cont out of the G basket no basket wipe it off he was all over him LeBron pull up yes yes LeBron James under two minutes of play the Lakers by four can they finish can they close huge win if they can LeBron bumping with Hunter trayon Drive kick three got it boy what a game this has been though Tyson times leads change 25 offensive foul he called a blocking foul Anthony Ste seta what a game hope you've been with us from the GetGo we're with you again on Sunday night at home against Portland looking for the W here to end the trip Daniels two big steps throws it in off the glass throws it in off the glass by the way Lakers have two timeouts Hawks have two timeouts Hawks have a foul to give Lakers are out of fouls Lakers down by a point Vincent trying to negotiate some space La B what a dunk what a read by Gabe I mean I can't tell you how well he's played nine points five di for Vincent Trae young for the lead again not going to get there Anthony Davis and Tangled with Okongwu and Davis comes up with it we are under a minute l with the ball in the lead and they need a scratch here as JJ takes a timeout beat you all right inbound and a tough pass nearly threw it to Daniels again one of the top defenders in the NBA and he is guarding LeBron eight to shoot l three in and out now boy that was long distance by Braun one-point game Trae young not there it's free ball taken on its way for the lead well second chance opportunities again they come back to bite you yeah shot clocks do is three ahead of the game clock Lakers are down by two remember not one that was a three that went down by Hunter underneath loose ball LeBron ties it now you it time out Atlant they have a chance to draw just a tick under 13 seconds remaining inbound it goes to Young here we go Hawks with a bucket could win it Lakers digging in defensively with six with five it's Trae young with three with two Trae young blocked blocked by Christie guess what we're going overtime we're going overtime LeBron we'll see how he's moving but again he appears to be okay yeah as we were saying KN to KN we all know it hurts for a moment maybe a little bit more than that and then you're okay underneath count it and one one five extra minutes of basketball give the Hawks a three-point lead to start OT cannot do that and the Lakers drop it out of bounds and save it a blind save dangerous although all the other Hawks have gone flown down to the other end Anthony Davis could have a dangerous pass but he has a little Runner that's not going to find home rebound Hunter who's been huge going to get it again here comes DeAndre look out look out first two baskets belong to the Hawks I think this is the first overtime game of the year for the Lakers going to be Christie launches a three wow Max Christie show us Max play like you're the star Max exactly defensive play to force OT knock down the first basket for your team in the extra session they switched again now you got Gabe on a big Daniels Hunter no no shot no shot well Max is gone for sure now yeah the cono blocked blocked by Rui that's good help by Rui because they switched and Gabe was on a big Aura get it out of here LeBron backing it up back and forth with the dribble into a little dance LeBron James with nine to shoot gets into his action down the middle he goes can't score wow it's right there oh bad pass Gabe got backed defensively too that was just a terrible pass it really was that's what come on I to give Gabe a little credit well you gave a lot of credit for when I say bad pass yeah exactly this will kind of it goes it doesn't go yeah there was nothing on that pass either lead for the whole game six that's foul is on a conu and by the way he's out he's fouled out of the game Anthony Davis ties it 10 and 10 for James triple double time all right so the Lakers have only missed two free throws tonight hasn't missed any of them yeah that's that's a good deal eight out of eight on his wallet was oh that was close to being off his leg he was right behind him he was hoping he was hoping oh there's the switch again so gabes on a b and you've got big on small Now red has picks up young who goes right around him went right around him got to change your defenses up a bit Lakers got to to Blitz him a little bit making pick his dribble up yeah we're more than halfway through the overtime LeBron on B pass boy that was a congested area now LeBron's open for three LeBron wow ball was free Gabe does a good job job of scoring Trae young we're going to get another fresh 14 though on the clock under 2 minutes and young scores which means we're tied at 127 I know I'm coming about all these ideas but again he's a guy that loves to run most due to their dominant hand he always runs off the screen with his dominant make him go the other way a bit Vincent for three Gabe what a game tonight for Vincent he's done so many things tonight we talk about LeBron and Anthony Davis and they're 30 plus game but game ball has to go to game he's played extremely well and he's got the Lakers up not one not two but three minute 28 there's a bounce on the oh put it up an in now controlling the action he started tonight can't hit rebound taken H it down by one he wanted Anthony Davis they took that away but he did a good job of just getting the shot up toward to bask under a minute y can't score tapped up no offensive foul on Clint box of 22 game is at 40.4 where inot and the Lakers lead by three trying to get to the basket all the way count of it goes it doesn't go shoot two free throws up coming Johnson Vincent just picked up his fifth foul Lakers have gone eight deep tonight I don't know Traore played four nine deep though in all Essence is eight eight yeah for the most part those eight yes all the minutes basically every everybody at least 20 of those eight that onepoint game 132 131 half a minute to play and the Lakers are nursing the one-point Advantage oh they steal it all the way blocked by LeBron it's blocked by James ruling within the appropriate time during the timeout the Sprite coaches the replay fishal has ruled that Atlanta calls the ball to go out of bounds therefore the challenge is successful La will receive possession of the ball with a game clock at 25.9 they have been charged the time out because it was their second challenge therefore they can advance the ball if into the front court if they choose to Atlanta will retain their timeout Lakers in decent shape and they get it to Anthony Davis he is surrounded jump ball jump ball it is a jump ball but you don't should control and if he's going to go anywhere it's right behind him yeah but there two smalls behind you yeah so you go Gabe and D'Angelo have the Gap now now look at Hunter Hunter has yeah and now Gabe's going like what are you doing now the officials are telling them get your position and then I'm going to stop it I'm going to let you stay where you are no moving around I think he's got look at them they're all still moving around he's got to go to Rui and LeBron got to look at him they're all moving around yeah I think he has to go there that's your only option and oh no it's going to be knocked out of bounds uhoh and it's going to be Atlanta with LeBron touching it last Atlanta has it out of bounds Atlanta has it out of bounds and they got it in young onepoint game shot clock is off game in the balance lot of times young not a hunter back to Young for the lead for the lead for that D say my mom for
