 between the Warriors and the Timberwolves Rudy Gobert Kevon Looney back in the starting lineup for the Warriors jumping up and Minnesota wins the tip here is Gobert nice look to McDaniels cutting couldn't finish looked like he might have gotten hit on the head no call but a really nice cut little old school basketball getting into Rudy Gobert and then just cutting off him in the low post here's Curry bouncing to Looney Kuminga in the corner in out and in on a three and that's the difficulty of guarding Golden State it's not just the initial pass it's the extra pass and often times they make the right pass here is Edwards Edwards dishing to McDaniels off to Conley four to shoot Conley with two to shoot McDaniels and Gobert just floats it in in time just barely got that off but that's the improvement from last year to this year I think in the Golden State Defense with this Personnel they do such a better job of containing the ball and staying in front of it that time Wiggins coughs it up Conley will shovel to Randle for the Throwdown well Draymond Green coming back after missing a couple of games but he's the biggest cheerleader for Jonathan Kuminga they really want him confident and I think that's one of the reasons Steve cerr has him in the starting lineup is to keep him confident after that 33-point Outburst against Houston last night they don't win the game without him he was awesome last night green applaud Wiggins who also played a big role in last night's win Wiggins two for two to start tonight an 8-4 lead the warrior this was three of four from three-point range last night at 23 points nine rebounds and a couple of steals he was outstanding having a big year Looney deflex it Gobert like he got hit on the ear here's Kuminga that's where he likes to do his work but Randle did a nice job to defend him without fouling Conley a three is good Mike Conley's had such a great career such an outstand he's like a cover Corner defensively it's not like he's going to you know strip the ball from you every time but he's so smart defensively I like that analogy right he may not have the most interceptions at the end of the year but he's also not giving up games to 100 yard receivers Brandin Podziemski it's the three much needed for him the shooting struggles have been immense for for Brandin Podziemski in his sophomore season just 21% from three thus far big Daniels with the answer and those are the shots that Minnesota's going to have to hit because you're going to see a lot of attention going to Anthony Edwards and rightfully so he's one of the best scorers in the game Edwards averaging a career i 26 as Kuminga elevates to knock down the jumper it's not easy elevating over Rudy Gobert who switched off on that little ball screen ction on the right side the Kuminga is so talented Warriors hoping to build off of the performance last night from Kuminga because he has shown flashes at times but there hasn't been a consistent run of production yet in his young career Wiggins fighting off that cover Corner Conley and able to finish great job of keeping Conley on his hip had a little bit of an advantage and just decelerated Warriors six for seven to start this game Edwards drops it in it's a pretty good shot making to start this game Jay it's just great shot making the NBA period yeah but I'm not sure there are very many better off the dribble shooting off the dribble than Anthony Edwards especially from three I mean two3 of his threes come off the dribble on Pace for one of the top seasons ever when it comes to off the dribble threes Julius Randle was holding Kuminga off as soon as he crossed half court trying to keep him on top able to do it and get the whistle as Kuminga is called for the personal just a an outstanding low post scorer in mid-range and he can go out and get you you know if things break down you can get it into his hands and he can go get them I thought it was interesting talking with Chris Finch about utilizing Julius Randle and and Finch familiar with Randle and coaching him because he had him in New Orleans when he was an assistant there and he said the thing that excites him most is Randle's playmaking he's like look he's a really good passer and I'm just encouraging him to make those decisions quicker in our offense sometimes he can fight wanting to be an ISO scorer a little bit but then he also brought up what you just said Jay and you know what it is useful to have a guy who can just go get you a bucket when a possession breaks down yeah I think he called it an on demand scoring threat yes you know you need it on demand he can go get it but his playmaking is really best I think in the middle of the floor like around the top of the key area and that's where he needs to be really decisive Kuminga can't hit that three 154 Warriors in front first quarter action Edwards pull up that one's short rebound knocked out of bounds by Trayce Jackson Davis Timeout on the floor Jonathan Kuminga it's one thing to elevate it's another thing to elevate over Rudy Gobert in his 79 Wings back with a big smile on his face Jonathan Kuminga told me it's kind of funny cuz we could just talk about everything and he can make it light by putting by making me smile Ryan a really good stuff Monica and what a perfect guy to talk to as McDaniels hits the three by the way if you're in the commercial break came back with us and thought oh my goodness two points have been taken off the board well yes they have the Rudy Gobert floater that just beat the shot clock did not in fact beat the shot clock was taken off the board as Moody can hit the three but you think about a player like Kevon Looney to mon story he was someone who battled injuries was not a rotation player as Edward slides in and gets fouled then all of a sudden worked his way into the rotation then became a key piece of it then became a key starter all while having success in this league then adjusted back to the bench now back in the starting lineup so what a perfect resource for Kinga and he's willing to do whatever it takes for his team to win you know he's not worried about his role he's going to play whatever role makes his team win and when you think about what Kevon Looney does for the Warriors since he's been inserted into the starting lineup he gets you extra possessions one of the best offensive rebounders in the league close to four offensive rebounds a game that's fifth in the NBA and he gets his teammates open CU he sets great screens and Steve K will say one of the just overall best attitudes and energies of any player he's ever coached well selfless is contagious too yeah that's right just the dynamite teammate here's Podziemski lobbing it up and on because of the travel and the first thing after a Call's made is the players go to to the you talk about changing Pace everybody thinks it means going faster a lot of times it means slowing down good extra pass Alexander Walker can it to three Here Comes Podziemski shoveling to Moody swing it around Wiggins back iron and off and the rebound out of bounds off of Minnesota Jackson Davis did just enough to disrupt the glass there and keep the possession alive yeah you give him credit for just trying to tip it away giv up on the play and not going over the top Jackson Davis who had started to begin the season 18 starts now coming off the bench as Golden State tries to piece together their 12 player rotation used a lot more depth than in the past and Steve K said it has provided him with more challenges trying to come up with the right combinations Reid in the corner no what a job by paj Podziemski to guard Julius Randle low post and then green all the way in plus the foul you can't run unless dealing with a left calf issue did not play last night back in there today Steve Kerr also told us he liked the idea of draymond's draymond's Defense coming off the bench as well with a Kuminga move to the starting lineup as Reid Soares in for the slam it's just a different Dynamic coming off the bench a lot of guys you you talk about oh he bring some Firepower coming off the bench you can get in a rhythm in a game in different ways and people think that getting in the Rhythm means offense you can get in a defensive Rhythm too green buries the three shot at plus 40% last season and shooting it well to begin this season as well over 40% entering tonight Steph Curry loving it from the bench Randle can't hit rebound flag down by Green lost his footing and Divincenzo takes Advantage yeah Green's still down you hope he's all right now gets back to his feet tied to 21 Warriors snapped a five-game losing streak last night Minnesota has won three straight after dropping four in a row Edwards the initial strip Jackson Davis can hook it in and those are plays that Trayce Jackson Davis has to finish around the basket Brandin Podziemski knocked it off Edwards he's able to save it here's Alexander Walker he got it nil Alexander Walker is having a great year one of the most consistent players on this Minnesota team and one of the best what is he eighth in minutes played yeah and yet he's impactful on every minute he's on the floor and if we want to go analytical he's top five as an individ ual Defender against ball screens green not that time Jackson Davis keeps it alive p Podziemski in and out and Edwards the rebound Chris Finch will take a timeout Minnesota two has those Hawks winning six in a row well Quin Snider is one of the smartest basketball Minds I've ever been around he's a savant so I'm not surprised that he's got the Hawks playing at such a high level he did an amazing job in Utah uh just a a big time thought thought guy in this league Divincenzo buries the three Hawks one tonight in overtime against the Lakers Golden State meanwhile has missed nine of its last 11 shots after that hot start Curry back in gets bumped and will shoot two so Curry different substitution pattern this season came out early now back in only playing 30 minutes a night well you don't want to ere extend Steph Curry at this point in his career you know he's such a great player he's going to he's going to get you over 20 in every game that's seems like a given but this is a long haul and I think Steve Curry and his staff have been very thoughtful about how to use both Steph Curry and Draymond Green to their highest level in fewer minutes and that's why the depth of this team even though there's a number of of one-way guys that they have to figure F out who's best together and when are they best in each part of the game from game to game the lineups have changed and it's uh it may be difficult to for individual players to find Rhythm but collectively they've overall been really good stenzo way off on a deep three there green tried to needle it in curry out of bounds off of Alexander Walker so Kyle Anderson Gary Payton the second Curry green on the floor for Golden State along with Moody as Divincenzo rejects Payton the second Moody knocks down to three that's where golden state is so smart out of bounds underneath they get it to Draymond Green in the middle of the floor and he got it to Payton the screener everybody looking for curry he's looking for the screener Reid misses that three and then comes up with a steal Reid Alexander Walker Gobert dento and Min not are the five for Minnesota I think those are the turnovers that drive Steve KK crazy just unnecessary Reid can't get it in around green Here Comes curry curry looking to take Donte Divincenzo now Reid on the switch Curry finds green lays it in Divincenzo wasn't ready for it and I'm not sure Draymond Green was ready for it he caught that ball late he wasn't looking for it he was looking to go set a wide pin down maybe make a cut but Steph Curry saw how open he was I'm not sure green picked up that ball till very late more like that ball caught him exactly then he caught that pass you saw a little smile as he was running down the court he's like God I almost didn't get that one Curry Banks it in bu the foul a little Spice from the chef you know when when people say well you know everybody else is playing checkers and he's playing chess and all that stuff Steph video game like he's a video game he really is with one hand from 18 ft while getting fouled it's ridiculous and in the Olympics this last summer in Paris it was fascinating against Serbia and then against France in the semi-final in the gold medal game the best players in the league stopped to watch him play one of the most captivating runs on a basketball court I think any of us have ever seen as Gobert slams it down and then gets the whistle late for the an one opportunity half of the players on the floor were already down on the other end of the court before that call was made but Gobert a chance for three are you bothered by a late call late calls don't bother me not if they're accurate and I think that was yeah I I I like it when the officials let the play Go not make a snap decision you know let the play go and then make the call if it's a little beat and it's the right call as as you rightfully said there then what's the big deal you don't get extra credit for whistling it right at the point of contact much better off right than being early and incorrect exactly Gobert completes the three-point play tied at 31 shot clock turned off here's Curry his three short rebound Moody taken away by Min not McDaniels a he and that'll ered at all he's he's started the last few games trying to get his teammates going and he's done that so he's playing the right way thanks thank you I thank you Monica Gary Payton the second loses it buy Hield in for Golden State here is Hield he got it and maybe that'll get him off to a good start buddy Hield has struggled shooting the ball over the last couple games three of 12 from three but I don't think Steve cerr is worried about it's like a baseball player a great hitter goes through a mini slump he hadn't forgotten how to shoot it we'll get to the back of the baseball card eventually with the way he shoots as Conley able to keep pton on his hip and finish and did it with a shot fake it still works how many years is Mike Conley been in this league 16-year career nothing phases him Looney couldn't handle it Divincenzo lobing it up to Gobert these giveaways and they have been giveaways for Golden State and you cannot guard a run out Curry's Runner rims off good box out there from Naz Reid here comes McDaniels McDaniels Burrows in and Banks it home that's just too easy in transition defense like that's real transition defense when it's after a miss you turn turn the ball over and the other team takes the other way you can't guard that but you can guard a missed shot and golden state did not do a very good job of getting back here's StDivincenzo he's had his own shooting struggles Reid off Mcdaniels Soares in Conley gives it back good movement here stenzo to Gobert who get stripped and it will stay here with Minnesota six to shoot just a great offensive rebound and that really put Golden State in rotation and that's where a shot fake can be so effective when the ball rotates around here StDivincenzo five to shoot will fire can't hit rebound Payton Kuminga able to gather the crosscourt pass he needs to get to the rim trying to do so on Conley and instead fires it away fifth turnover for Golden State yeah they have not been what I would call good turn there's no such thing as a good turnover but some of these have been bad turnovers yeah or they're just really bad decisions and that was a poor decision by Kuminga how we classify that one just trying to get me and you involved in the action yeah well you can get back up from under the table now no no no a change up I'm saying right here there wasn't enough velocity on that Curry the dish yeah Payton unable to finish it squirms out to Divincenzo again Minnesota looking a push that was Gobert's presence that led to that Miss shot a four time Defensive Player of the Year only he Ben Wallace and dmbe Matumbo in that club Curry Kuminga looked like he might have had an opportunity to drive Baseline instead a foul here against McDaniels yeah I think when he caught it he had the ability to take that right to the rim yeah and that's what his strengths are he's a a world class athlete and when he can get downhill he he he and Steph Curry are the two best on the Warriors they do it in different ways of putting pressure on the rim and that that's really where kaming is at his best is putting pressure on the rim Curry does it one with his drives but also with his Cuts Curry off on that three 0 for three from Deep to start this game did not play last night dealing with runner's knee Conley flips it in boy middle of the floor you got your point guard setting the screen for your Forman as a pick and roll Handler well and Jay there has been a sharpness to Minnesota offensively 14 assists already in the half Conley can't hit that one Gobert tips it alive another chance for the Timberwolves Randle one-on-one with Kuminga spinning and is fouled and Julius Randle is going to shoot too yeah Kuminga just has to make Randle make that shot Looney did a great job of coming shot he can't foul there but your point about sharpness I think the sharpness starts on the defens event for Minnesota they've been sharp defensively Looney does a great you ever have one of those situations Jay where you're you're the person taking the picture and you don't come through for a friend with a celebrity no well I don't get asked very much yeah my favorite thing of of pictures is I was told Eli Manning when somebody wouldn't recognize him and say hey bud can you take a picture of me and my wife or something he would change the phone to a different uh language oh my gosh and it back to him that's tremendous a prankster till the end Randle can't finish it Looney the rebound tried to draw the foul and again Jay this is what you're talking about these low percentage passes seven turnovers now for Golden State and they've had four in the last four minutes and that's leading to a lot of paint opportunities because right now Minnesota is scoring way more in the paint oh Wiggins and Looney upset thought they had a steal instead a foul Steve cerr waiting for a look at it and Golden State not using a challenge there now some of them may not be them seeing a foul may just be them not wanting to use a challenge in this situation Conley off one leg and a shot clock violation against Minnesota really good rotations by Golden State on that possession but to your point Ryan about turnovers I think it's the decisions that are being made yeah Steve Kerr has had a couple issues he called out Brandin Podziemski a couple games ago I think when they played Denver and it's not that Podziemski's got a ton of turnovers it's just when they're coming in the type of turnovers that he wants them to be a smart player get his team organized and make the right decision Conley fouls Podziemski guard the ball and contain the ball much better so they're not putting rotation as often but jimy able to tip that rebound such a good rebounding guard Golden State by the way this year fourth in defensive efficiency struggled a bit lately there but really good defensively last night against Houston as Wiggins can't finish Reid Edwards pull up off Randle attacks the offensive glass and finishes nothing Podziemski could do there to block off Julius Randle but that's another one where Golden State just needs to finish I mean Rudy Gobert is not in the game and you've got to be able to attack the rim finish there when Gobert's in there might be a little bit different another turn another 12o Minnesota run looking to add to it here Edwards Randle short P Podziemski able to hang on to that rebound eight turnovers in the half already for Golden State Brandin Podziemski can't hit the floater Warriors have gone almost 6 minutes without scoring theyve missed their last eight shots as Randle loses it out of bounds right here time for tonight's National TV schedule brought to you by ESPN bet the official sports book of remember then the semis will be Saturday and then the championship the following Tuesday on ABC as green finally ends the drought what a spin move along the Baseline for Draymond Green he's a Hall of Famer don't you think yes I think Draymond Green's going to be in the Nay Smith Basketball Hall of Fame eight times all defensive team four time Champion two-time all NBA as Edwards Banks it in and I know Jay you know you have reasons for why a player like green could get in now well I think the the Hall of Fame has done a much better job of valuing Defense over the last decade or so and Rudy Gobert's going to the the Hall of Fame as well I mean four time NBA Defensive play of the year eight times First Team all defensive he's been all NBA uh three times I think on either first second or third team and you know that's valued now at a higher level than perhaps it was in the past Edwards out to read his three is good timeout taken by Golden State Reid and Edwards Collide in the celebration but the continuing to work with Coach Nat is is going to be really fun he as you saw the roster sort of coming together and you mentioned being able to stay with Coach Nat what did you think was something that you immediately wanted to bring to this organization yeah I mean just who I am I don't know just bring that toughness um you know and just working hard uh earning everything uh knowing that nothing's given and just that mindset that's what coach Nat is all about and I know that I will fit right into that with her all right now Kate I got to ask you have you started started trying to recruit free agents yet we know over 20,000 season ticket deposits already here obvious they already know what they're doing more than I do so I I'll keep that up to them but obviously I'm excited to have anybody and uh excited to you know meet my teammates and work with them all right Kate well congratulations we appreciate the time and we'll see you out in the bay soon enough yep thank you guys that's Kon Martin joining us after the Valkyries expansion draft they will play the home games right here at Chase Center beginning this summer ESPN your home for the WNBA as Draymond Green gets hit with a T he was very upset about a non-all on that last offensive possession and picks up the technical foul is sixth of the Season where he was down in the middle of the lane you thought he might be hurt Steph Curry pulling him back now to try to stop the discussion with the officials but he was down underneath the bucket and I thought for a second je is he hurt again Draymond is chatting it up with Julius free throw no good off the T it might have been a foul with the hold off but I don't think anything happened up top where he was selling action and then there's the T I tend to call that rebounding that you get a little get away with a little bit more rebounding than you do any other time yeah but right now I mean this is a 20 to2 run yeah Edwards into the paint throws it away Kuminga able to save it here's green pushing Pace into the corner Waters can't hit the three golden states had some good looks from Deep during this run nothing dropping they're now five of 18 from three Edwards you bet Anthony Edwards celebrates his second triple of the game 12 points four rebounds three assists for the young Superstar Kuminga reverses it in very few players in the league are better in the short rle decision making than Draymond Green that was just a great decision to hit Kuminga in a difficult spot Edwards misses that one taking nearly 11 threes a game this year Curry back door lays it in on the delivery from Green and Chris Finch doesn't want anything to start Minnesota than you've seen from Golden State I think we mentioned before Minnesota's been having fun in this game and that's not what you want in an opponent when you're on your home floor is for the other team to have fun you wanted to be make it difficult on them and so far Minnesota's had 20 field goals 17 assists on those field goals well and also you know to that point about having fun jay as stenzo misses the three what a rebound from Gobert over the back of his Nemesis green then lost it this is also a Minnesota team that wasn't having fun just a week ago as Gobert fouls Wiggins and Wiggins will shoot two Draymond Green took Wiggins out at half court this is a real screen here make your knockout round picks with NBA pickup Tournament Challenge presented by Microsoft copile L we on the NBA app Wiggins hits both Warriors trying to build a little run at the end of this second six straight from Golden State after a 23-2 Minnesota run CH the handoff Edwards surrounded five to shoot McDaniels floater is good boy pretty shot at the end of that possession Golden State bringing two to the ball trying to get it out of the hands of Anthony Edwards and that was a big time shot by McDaniels dominga can't finish it on the drive McDaniels gives it back to Edwards five to shoot Mcdaniels spinning dishing Gobert the spin couldn't Bank it in 15-point Advantage for Minnesota seeking a fourth straight win Curry into the corner Waters connects Draymond Green is putting up some numbers in this first half double figure scoring he's got at least six rebounds that's got to be five four or five assists for him four assists six rebounds and 10 points now a steel what a pass Kuminga lobing Wiggins couldn't slam it McDaniels fouls Wiggins crowd was ready to pop Wiggins will shoot twoo you talk about being a connector a great defensive play by Draymond Green and the Draymond Green may not be a big- time scorer but he's a big time player at both ends coming up on halftime presented by Hyundai Lakers let down Maliko will Bon perk and Wendy in the studio one of the things that's nice about uh when you do the second game on the west coast you get to watch the pregame with them yes got to watch the expansion draft with the Valkyries right into malikan the crew pregame had a lively discussion about who the Warriors might be able to pursue as they seek a another star to add to the mix man you got big perk standing on a box like he needs to get right more elevation an 112 Golden State response slight Difference game and shot clock Edwards draws two again five to shoot McDaniels guarded nicely by Kuminga coming up with a strip McDaniels throws up an airball and a shot clock violation with golden state with Draymond Green playing the five Kuminga at the four outstanding goodine yeah a lot of alliteration tickling word Enthusiast everywhere before the end of the half green nearly put it in was able to get that 112 run that came with Draymond Green at the five and that's a good lineup at times you don't want two often with the green at the five cuz it just wears him out Kuminga in the corner can it to three Curry a deep one back iron and off oh he was walking back he thought he made that Randle left it short Wiggins pops it out Brandin Podziemski tried to dump it to Looney Curry wide open got that one he's not going to miss two from the same spot but Kevon Looney to start this second half kept the ball alive for an offensive rebound then the pass back out to Curry you know those are the type of winning plays that Steve CT talks about with Kavon Looney long rebound Kuminga able to get two Randle a little bit flat footed there Brandin Podziemski the drive the shovel Kuminga one for four from downtown able to swerve around go for two that's where he's at his best is attacking the rim putting pressure on the rim nine points for Kuminga four for 10 from the floor had a career ey 33 last night Golden State picking up where they left off at the end of that second Randle the spin and the legay that's where he's so good in that mid post area just so strong with that lower base he catches you leaning one way and it just spins right off your body knocked out of bounds by McDaniels making the quick move you don't want a three or four dribble back down Kuminga leaves it short Randle off the rebound loose handle kept alive Edwards difficult shot but he sticks it as good a shooter off the dribble as you're going to find in the NBA and it's been interesting to watch his shot profile evolve this year Jay because I mean he's averaging over almost 11 threes a game he is on Pace to have the third most threes in a season all time and it's a little less in the paint than we've seen in the past but a lot more from the perimeter well he's shooting 42% from three so you want him to take good ones Curry gets fouled and will shoot three Steph Curry is so good at getting his feet set and getting into to a shot and he's got the ability to stop on a dime give a little fake you might leave your leave the floor and he's gone three fouls on Gobert three on McDaniels taking a look at the upcoming Emirates NBA Cup schedule double header TNT Tuesday and on ESP ESPN Wednesday dickos the Hawks TNT Wednesday it'll be the Warriors at Houston for more on these games please go to nba.com or visit the NBA app and remember semis will then be Saturday in the championship following Tuesday on ABC when Steph Curry shoots a free throw is the mouth guard always to the left right is that part of the rout tee maybe he's rightee dominant keeps it to the left I think when he goes to the line it should be like in baseball where you don't have to throw four pitches for the intentional walk just put the put it up put the number up and let's go he doesn't miss well he is the greatest free throw shooter of all time by career percentage Curry took a chance there Podziemski flags it down Waters bangs in the three and a timeout taken by Minnesota a different Warriors team the woman with the Warriors Family Foundation the president of it uh which has granted over $30 million in cash grants to local Bay Area nonprofits that focus on education so certainly someone who is heavily involved in the community here as well here's Conley he got it on a three Julius Randle just drew so much attention when he kicked it out that extra pass is so vital it's not just the extra pass it's the right pass and Conley was wide open here's Curry on the drive flings it out to Waters Kuminga three to shoot pimi able to dip in and finish his activity level is so high and Brandin Podziemski is willing to put his body on the line draws a lot of charges goes to the glass had 11 rebounds against Houston last night a career high he was willing to stick his nose in there but he's got really good footwork able to get around a little step through you talk about the rebounding for Brandin Podziemski 11 boards last night yeah most of those 11 coming on the defensive end yeah but just the fact he's willing to stick his nose in there and rebound is a really big deal especially for this team I mean everybody has to rebound on the defensive end for Golden State they don't have a glass cleaner Monica little injury update yeah Ryan the Warriors will be trying to get backto back whims without the services of Andrew Wiggins who's out with a right ankle impingement and Moses Moody is a left knee inflammation they will not return all right Monica this is a couple of key pieces Wiggins had 11 in that first half yeah Kuminga no and go bear the rebound Mel unable to finish after the crossover I thought Curry was trying to foul him there Kuminga off the delivery from curry dominga with 11 now boy Lindy Waters has come into this game he didn't play the last two games at all was a dnp come in here at knock down a couple threes he's been really active defensively had been starting for a couple games before those dnps as Randle cans the three Minnesota's getting a piece of the paint and then kicking it out just collapsing the defense Kuminga Elevate sure he is a confident player that that was an impressive 33 he put up against the Rockets last night it was more old school basketball a lot of pick and roll trying to take advantage of matchups big plays down the stretch of that game as well McDaniels off P Podziemski the rebound Kuminga throws it into the back court just too much of a hurry maybe trying to get it to Curry he was guarded as he's trying to cut around on the left side gold State's going to go to Pat Spencer with those injuries that Monica talked about what a great story Pat Spencer is former Lacrosse star who actually holds the D1 Men's Lacrosse record for career assists well he basically won the Heisman Trophy of Lacrosse I'm not sure what it's called I should but went to lyola of Maryland and had a fan white Deion Sanders but still pretty good that's right last year got in six games with golden state this tonight his seventh already that he's played with them this year Edwards so smooth on the spin and well defended by Kevon Looney switching out on him Podziemski gives it up Waters wow the pass didn't have a chance made it to the third row curling that screen picked up by Looney and that's just great offense beating good defense that was a good challenge Gobert and Reid were battling each other and it's Divincenzo ends up with it double drag up top surprised Gobert didn't roll so that NZ Reid could be the pop guy Edwards connects on a three Welly when he was at Georgia you know he had what what 42 43 points against Michigan State and Maui and you're always thinking boy if he would shoot more free throws get to the pat Spencer right out of the timeout unable to hit the three Minnesota strong response after Golden State had whittel what was a 19point deficit down to three just moments ago Edwards started the possession knocked out of bounds last touch Minnesota it's going to be Golden State basketball know for the most part throughout this game Minnesota they're better in Second Chance opportunities 2818 in the paint Jackson Davis blows the bunny off the delivery from Green that should have been 2820 there yeah can't miss those easy ones Edwards turns it over here comes pyton Spencer bounces wow there been a lot of aggressively inaccurate passes tonight well it's just not the right play I mean Spencer made a nice drive dumped it off to Trayce Jackson Davis he's got to finish that but I think the presence of Gobert in the game changes everything yeah like Gobert is so good at helping and recovering and he challenges so many shots Reid near the outed strip Gobert push shot little off here comes Waters Monica let us know Warriors will be without Moses Moody and Andrew Wiggins the rest of the game as pton can it the three Jackson Davis the rebound Curry on the bench at the moment greens three off as well Gobert secures it Golden State now 8 for 28 from Deep that's just 28% one of the most impressive stats I think for Minnesota remains 27 field goals 23 assists for a team that averages just 24 and a half a game yeah usually it's the Warriors doing that to other teams got away with a walk there couldn't take advantage good snatched rebound by Donte Divincenzo and for the most part Minnesota's done a good job on the defensive glass especially with the longer rebounds Edwards off on that one rebound deflected by Green Edwards sees it the whole way Gobert ends up with it off the deflection Gobert gives Reid denied by Green but the follow is good these turnovers have got to be concerning for Steve Kerr it's just the decision making yeah you have bad decisions make bad possessions Jackson Davis can't finish it again but a block is called and free throws here for Jackson Davis and a good number of golden states turnovers are what I would call unforced errors you know that's that's an unforced error that's just a lazy pass one-handed from Pat Spencer and Anthony Edwards read it the whole way and just shot the Gap and how 13 turnovers for Golden State Edwards will get a breather he's talking with Alex Rodriguez one of the owners of the Timberwolves about and Anthony Edwards and he said you know on Thanksgiving day he was in the gym at the facility for 3 hours that's just how much this guy is committed and loves this game well he he's in most every way he's such a a tremendous Pro but he's got a part of him that's like a little kid too like he loves video games plays them all the time and then I was amazed he never packed his own back yeah he doesn't pack his own back that's Ryan ruko stuff hey your butler does it for you that's right and he does a wonderful job by the way really a fan of the shoe choices on this trip Monica well guys that's hilarious Ryan just to add to the Anthony Edwards that Thanksgiving Day Workout Dante dzo was in there with him as well and Dante told me when you meet this guy it feels like you've known him for years years but he said as far as leadership goes when it comes to Anthony Edwards He's young so he sees it differently but it it it sounded different that when you heard it than it was when you read it how did you feel about it well Jay I think that's a great point and Jaden Daniels said to me earlier today he's like man that was so overblown I think the idea of teamwork when you consume it as a fan sometimes you think that that is all beautiful music at all points and to me true teamwork is being able to be accountable and be honest and call out areas where you need to be better and and that's what Anthony Alber was doing that's a great point it it's sort of the idea that it's one thing to to say something it's also how your teammates handle it Payton able to handle the contact well there as he lays it in plus the foul wild sequence back and forth and a chance for three for Gary pyton the second a really effective use of the challenge by Minnesota so a potential three-point play wiped out and turned into an offensive foul see with that right arm he's left-handed using the left hand but just clearing out Naz Reid so it wasn't the contact from Reid that was the foul in replay it was the illegal contact by the offensive player pton II I think it was the right call J no question and you're right I mean what a swing if you're Minnesota Golden State going on a little bit of a response run a chance for three instead wiped off the board Randle bodies in might have got away with a walk Reid won't get a chance at it as the travel is called just a little bit too much from Julius Randle he had the advantage to go straight up with it just decided to give a little bit extra there and shot fake and wound up walking with it but when he caught the ball elbow extended they got the split action then he was isolated and really had an advantage just gave up the advantage Curry looking for a whistle himself and is going to get it yeah the defender was in the restricted Arc Steph Curry giving a little Euro and because Randle did not jump in the restricted Arc that's a foul hey the annual NBA on Christmas Day tradition continues five star study games on ESPN ESPN Plus in ABC Spurs Nicks starts today at noon Eastern a special Real Time with Drew Carter I cannot wait to see Monica mcnutt's animation oh amazing it will not be better dressed than she is tonight no way Randle buries the three do you think we can all get animated versions of ourselves even if we're not on that all cast or this is exclusive to Drew and Monica that's not in your contract I I I didn't get that Clause Curry denied inside and a whistle is it a foul or just out of bounds really good pass by danty D Payton Warriors are in the bonus so free throws here it's just tough action to guard getting that screen on the inbounder to get that quick post to your point about Randle highest three-point percentage in the last four seasons shooting at at 36% just under entering tonight take a look Gary Payton getting the screen from Steph Curry and just steps right in Dante G venzo just grabbing him so he couldn't get around in front if you pay too much attention trying to keep the ball away from Payton then you got Curry coming off the screen getting a three 5 seconds left in the quarter and an offensive foul called on Conley his second and what you have that dribble handoff action you got to be careful not to jump in the way of the defender 5 seconds left to operate for Golden State both teams been sloppy with the basketball tonight Curry separates takes and hits and that that KS the game we can get offense out off of our defense thank thank you thank you Monica Warriors get another chance here off the offensive rebound Kyle Anderson the former member of the Timber wolv was beloved there on the drive lays it in well before the offensive rebound that was a disorganized possession but it was Kyle Anderson that got Golden State organized on that second opportunity Gobert center of the lane able to finish off the setup from Conley and that's really the question right now with this lineup you who's going to get golden state into their stuff good pin in screen Curry connects Ryan that's an example of Kevon Looney getting a shot for a teammate that pin in fReid up Steph Curry for that shot Divincenzo too strong Waters tipped it out of bounds Minnesota basketball now watch number five Kevon Looney just setting that little pin in screen so that Steph Curry can come back toward the ball and those are the best cuts whether to the ball or to the basket Curry's come alive now 21 points Wiggins and Moody out for the remainder of this game as Edwards took a shot through the foul Kuminga guarding Anthony Edwards then Kevon Looney was coming up to get two on the shooting Edwards turning the corner through three Defenders pondley connects Bo what a pass by Anthony Edwards little Baseline Drive and Baseline drift Kuminga couldn't throw it down on the lob from Curry but Naz Reid there to disrupt it Sixpoint Minnesota lead Edwards pull up three is good push the foul andman fully engaged just a spectacular jump shooter and possessions draws three Defenders makes an incredible pass to create a three and then a good pullup three himself can't ask for a better shot than that a good pass from Looney 70 Minesota run as Edwards loses it out of bounds 17th Minnesota turnover yeah he knew that double was coming just lost the ball playing with to the free throw line more with that athleticism that body you know it's not that he settles for threes but man when he gets to the rim how many guys can Elevate like him and finish Waters can't hit and the answer is not many not many they don't make him like him very often no Steph Curry was the one that opened up that three for Waters with that terrific curl cut that's where it's a different team than when they had the Splash Brothers Conley knocked off him out of bounds 18th turnover now for Minnesota they do struggle in that department 23rd in the NBA an offensive turnover percentage Curry wheeling and gets denied by Conley Boney trailing the play able to finish one of the best offensive rebounders in the league Steph Curry draws so much attention there's nobody there to block him out he goes to the offensive class just about every opportunity Edwards gives it up Gobert slides in and slams just had the advantage guarden by Kyle Anderson and took advantage of it no hesitation foul on Anthony Edwards who was pushing Steph Curry he was just trying to see how many pushes he could get away away with Hield rims out Golden State now 10 for 35 from three Minnesota 13 for 35 and that's essentially your difference on the scoreboard with Minnesota of 10 they've had some open ones Lindy Waters had some open ones Hield with that one Payton able to save it but again just an over ambitious maybe pass and transition just not the right decision he works so hard to get the ball back and then kick it back to him and almost give up a three and again Conley in the corner whoa it's tough to make a comeback when you're not getting shots up you know that's what these turnovers have done nearly another you know whether you throw the ball out of bounds I mean you turn it over a live ball turnover team takes the other way you can't guard that but even when you throw it out of bounds you're giving up an opportunity to get a shot opportunity to get fouled opportunity for an offensive rebound three really good things and Golden State you give credit to Minnesota's defense because their defense has been really good y but I think from the Golden State perspective there have been some times when they've been really loose with the ball Hield meets Gobert backs away Curry getting a breather now in this fourth Hield drops it out of bounds that's three straight turnovers from Golden State and that turnover I think was made by Gobert you know Hield trying to get the shot off against one of the best shot blockers and he hit singles get guys on base and that if Golden State's not doing this still they're only down 10 you know with 643 to go in regulation but that's got to be cleaned up you can't cough the ball up like this Minnesota's def defense is really good and you give the defense credit but a number of the turnovers we just saw weren't defense related they were just bad decisions by Golden State 18 turnovers from Golden State Reid off on a three Minnesota actually has 19 turnovers in this game but they have not felt as mindless or have not come at as critical of moments yes green gets denied what a rejection from Naz Reid Alexander Walker you bit what a sequence from the Timberwolves just a great play by Naz Reid off the keeper by Green no 13-point Minnesota lead trying to win a fourth straight game after Anthony Edwards called out his team is soft he and the entire group have responded Edwards sticks another we just creates that space against Podziemski knocking him back a little bit to get yet another jumper off the dribble what a smooth stroke Curry can't pop it in Gobert the rebound well that block by Naz Reid with such a momentum play we saw Reid make a couple of blocks just like that last Friday night on ESPN against the Clippers in Minnesota's first win to snap their four game losing streak and start this winning streak well especially when Golden State draws Gobert away from the bucket and Reid comes in flies in to save a basket cuz Draymond Green made a great move on that keeper and that's usually going to be a bucket every time C up Hawks coming off an overtime win today against the Lakers so the garden will be rocking for that game Wednesday Trey young a a popular Villain at MSG and Atlanta getting great contributions from Jaylen Johnson he is a he is a really effective player Edwards turns the corner Euros reverses and the foul Anthony Edwards looking to shut the door on this Friday night contest really good a 172 Minnesota run after Golden State at closed to 8077 and this is the kind of defense this is what the fourth game in a row we're starting to see this as a trend now from Minnesota like the hold Golden State down like this has been really impressive and the numbers bear it out not just the the scoring numbers but 36% from the field Golden State 28% from three they have been well guarded all game long just 17 assists for Golden State as Gobert gets fouled it's the Golden State team that averages just under 30 assists a game so if this holds and Minnesota allows fewer than 95 points again tonight be the first time since 2012 they have held an opponent sub 95 in four straight games and obviously last year I mean the calling card of their team was their ferocious defense right they were by Far and Away the most efficient team defensively in the NBA this year did not start out that way but now we're seeing it Jay and it's you know it makes you realize what this team is capable of doing again especially as it comes Springtime and that's what they have to be as a great defensive team first but the last three games you know there was part of part of you that was thinking all right they did it against the Clippers twice with Norman Powell out and the Lakers in a game where you don't want to say the Lakers gave up but they kind of waved the White Flag in that one what are they going to do in this building against Golden State look what they've done I mean we're talking about a trend now and it's a positive trend for Minnesota Edwards lobing it up go a little exclamation point well Minnesota's back to having fun again there was a point in the second and third quarters where they've had their brow forur because golden state was fighting back but they've taken all the air out of this building in the fourth quarter Golden State getting ready to empty their bench second half of a backto back as well for the Warriors who beat Houston last night to snap a five-game losing streak here's Reid over to McDaniels Edwards side stepping two why not a 30-point night for Anthony Edwards throw in eight assists and a timeout taken by Golden State he is a flamethrower out so the other starters remain other key players remain for Minnesota now Chris Finch is going to send all of his Subs to the table Edwards one more lob Gobert the slam a ninth assist for Anthony Edwards Gobert with 17 points and 12 boards when you say this has been a mature game for Anthony Edwards with all the defensive attention he saw double teams coming his way two on the ball I can't remember him really forcing anything you made a lot of he had a few turnovers made a lot of really good decisions with the ball and Jay all of this has come clearly it's been received and acted upon in a positive way on the brink of a fourth straight win since those comments I think one other point Chris Finch made that's interesting as he said look Anthony Edwards is also everybody on our team's biggest cheerleader right and when you have a a star that works as hard as he does and cares as much you respect them right and then you know the 30 and n it helps emphasize the point right you're darn right 21 turnovers now for Golden State m not unable to hit Hield the rebound and you're Golden State you're going to hold your breath on the ankle injury to Wiggins tonight whether or not that causes him to miss any notable amount of time Moses Moody as well left this game earlier for the Warriors yeah without having Wiggins in the rotation that was certainly a makes it more difficult for Golden State but you certainly don't want to gloss over that you know Wiggins being out in the second half that didn't cause all the turnovers no and the miscues that took Golden State out of an opportunity to really compete in this second half for a win that is season eye 21 turnovers Spencer comes down with that a 20th turnover for Minnesota buddy Hield Banks it in the only thing in doubt at this point is whether or not Golden State finds a way to 95 points to end that streak for Minnesota but the Timberwolves on the brink of holding an opponent under 95 for a fourth straight game for the first time since 2012 and that is going to be a season High 22nd turnover for Golden State and there's the note Minnesota doing something they have not done in more than a decade holding an opponent sub 9 five for a fourth straight game and this a fourth straight win
