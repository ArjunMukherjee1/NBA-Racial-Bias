environment all summer long you know dudes been in the gym working on their bodies on their game build your foundation here get better from it they're going to throw you know strong punches at us and if we want to be a good team we have to rise to that everybody we welcome you to the shores of Lake Michigan where tonight the work doesn't begin it continues for the Oklahoma City Thunder who open up the 2023 2024 NBA season against a team from the Eastern Conference in the Chicago blls from the United Center of the home of Zach LaVine and Demar DeRozan welcome inside everybody alongside my broadcast partner Michael I am Chris fer and Michael we've been waiting a long time for this night it is opening night and I know everybody including us is pretty excited yeah whether you're a player former player fan former fan doesn't matter it's opening night I've been so excited and I'm glad it's here we're going to be talking about a lot of the Thunder players over the course of tonight but let's start with Shai Gilgeous Alexander coming off of a spectacular season a year ago he was an all NBA first teamer well you talk about all NBA and it just continues from there average over five assists a game pass the basketball to terrific Defender underrated as a Defender fourth in the league it's scoring at over 31 a game he has just been outstanding he's got a game Michael that we are very familiar with but somebody's game who we're going to get familiar with as this season goes on how about Chet Holmgren who's going to be making his first career start here tonight for the Thunder now even though he was out for a season he was still around his teammates so he learned the Cadence of the league exposure to his teammates had a terrific preseason and he's starting his career tonight as well played Four preseason games for OKC what did we learn in those four preseason games Michael I know that he is really really gearing to get out there tonight well I thought he'd fit in like a glove because he's one of those guys who can take the ball up the court he can pass he can shoot he's got the stretch game to him as well that's describing the other four guys on the floor which really adds a strong element to the guys that are coming back from last season all right we will see this Thunder team in action for the first time this season as it starts tonight the long journey this is just step number one when we come back to the United Center we'll take a look at the Chicago Bulls as it's opening night here the best in Oklahoma a thunder open the season on the road here in the windy city against the Chicago bows a little snapshot into what they did a season ago they lost in the second round of the play in tournament to the Miami Heat as the 10 seed offensively what do they do they take the fewest threes in the NBA but they make up for it and their shot diet by taking the most mid-range shots at almost 18 a game led by Demar Derozan well the bulls have a new look offense this year Chris but at the same time they got the old school guys and Demar DeRozan he loves to play in the mid-range he's a guy playing a little bit better defense this season how about this shooting over 50% from the field a season ago K high at 5.1 assists he's got the total packet and when that guy is not hot how about this guy here Zach LaVine all career numbers points per game assists and rebound now we all know he likes to play around the basket he can Elevate but at the same time he's one of the purest three-point Shooters in the association the two players averaging over 24 points per game but tonight the Thunder Are Back In Action Chet Holmgren Jalen Josh Giddey and the rest of the Thunder crew lot of some tip from Chicago coming up next and a thank you to Royce young for that narration and when the schedule comes out there's certain games you Circle opening night is one of them and we are coming to you from one of the great Sports cities of America Chicago the Thunder vers the Bulls tonight's starting lineups are brought to you by KIA let's give you okay Shai Gilgeous Alexander Josh Giddey they'll be in the back court with Lu Dort Jalen going into year number two Jalen and of course Chet Holmgren making his first career start for the Bulls Coby white Zach LaVine Demar Derozan Patrick and the veteran NCA vuich will be at the five and for the first time tonight let's send it over to another member of our broadcast crew and say hi to Nick Gallow thanks Chris the excitement has been there for the Thunder all of October but tonight is the first opportunity for a taste of perspective the Thunder has Flex that muscle of being able to gain experiences learn from them and then apply those lessons but this is a new season with new challenges ahead but this thunder squad has great continuity coming into this season 13 returning players as you'll see in tonight's for fact now the second youngest team in the league has burgeoning chemistry but Mark deel said that chemistry requires two crucial elements guys a clearly developed role definition for each player and then an understanding of how to play in OKC system that process continues along tonight all right thank you Nick and let's take a look at tonight's Sonic key match up oh how about Mr all NBA first team Shai guis Alexander career high over 31 points a game last season folks just in this Fifth Season also averaged over five assists and there's another guy to keep your eyes on tonight for the Bulls Zach LaVine average a career best at 24.8 points a game last season as he looks to get the Bulls back into playoffs and we are underway and thank you for being with us from the United Center in Chicago game one of 82 step number one and what is going to be a very long journey first shot there it is a three from Jalen and he drains it and that's you know that's picking up with a thunder you know left off in the preseason where you you know collapse the defense by getting the ball to the middle of the floor and then kicking out to the shooter there's the very athletic Patrick on a fade away a little gentle bump off of Josh Giddey well there is a lot of energy in the building tonight you could feel it as soon as you walked in NBA of course tipped off last night with a couple of games there's a nice drive by Jalen just couldn't finish on that finger roll and Chicago with DeRozan that drive high off the glass and bich was able to tip it up and in now Michael we saw this team five preseason games getting ready for the the regular season of course had training camp for the first couple of weeks of October but very much still working their way into the season as Jalen looked like for a moment he had that Miss from Chet Holmgren well this is you know you know obviously everybody's trying to F tune their offense and defense in the preseason it's all real business right now that's going to be a foul on Coby white tried to strip the ball from Jalen but what you just saw that play there that is what was happening a lot in the preseason learning to play defense collapsing the defense I've still said that Shai Guild gets no credit for his defense it's underrated but he's got a 6'1 wingspan he knows how to use it okay see your your wings span's probably about 6'1 you can't reach reach in there and poke the ball away like he just did and not get called for a foul he can do that speaking of a a wide wing span how about the man at the free throw line and Jalen 72 Wings span knocked down the three now at the free throw line but you're absolutely right about Shai Gilgeous-Alexander I mean that's where his game really really elevated particularly on the defensive end something that he took just so much pride in one of the reasons why he was first team all NBA you see Mark dnal now into year number four 38 years old guiding this young Thunder team and how about Shai also shooting over 50% from the field while averaging partner over those 31 points a game that's quite impressive you talk about efficiency the me tough shot and the ball is tapped out to white white cross cour pass over to Patrick as Vucevic was calling for it you see Dort battling with him trying not to give him an easy catch shot clocked under three DeRozan on the drive goes with a finger roll and Demar Derozan so crafty now into year number 15 yeah I thought Lu did a good job of keeping bruich from getting that basketball he camped out there for 10 seconds Mr referee my goodness G using every ounce of physicality and that is going to be a blocking foul easy cuz it looked like white slipped and fell which impeded the progress there of home of Giddey and that will be a foul on white that's two quick ones on him no white has gotten the starting job at the point guard position man that's just inadvertent had he not made contact and took out the legs of Giddey probably wouldn't have been a foul but that's something to watch for the bull their starting point guard with two fouls J down the lane goes with the left hand high off the glass and that's what we saw so much from his rookie year Michael he loves to go left well then that's a smart play I mean he he knocked down a three he showed you he can drive to the basket just showing you this offensive repertoire that's good defense asine kind of made contact with the face of Giddey now how about this you know he's looking to pass the basketball but all the white shirts did not squeeze that time and block his path he went all the way down Main Street and he has just got such a physicality to his game something that he feels like he is going to be able to elevate to putting on a little weight over the course of the offseason another foul on Chicago and that's what you want to do remember we talked about that as one of the key stats to look out in our pregame show with Royce and John from the studio and it was keeping the Bulls off that free throw line right now the Thunder put up three fouls on them two more fouls they'll be shooting free throws for the rest of the quarter trying to take advantage of the size and he does with white defending him and Giddey getting down low inside the block with the turnaround well we got 6'8 against 6' three smart play by Giddey taking your time that's not always something a young guy is willing to do with the basketball is be patient and the pull up by Patrick really responded last year missed his entire second year played Just 17 games with that knee injury but bounced back well last year as Shai will drive take a bump little physicality for him as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander got down low in scores well the Thunder doing a good job right now just establishing their game o of just playing downhill basketball I mean forcing the Bulls to make decisions with the basketball I mean excuse me about the basketball coming their way and that's where your transition starts to affect you this early in the season where everybody's kind of working on the the defense chemistry-wise LaVine little side step and is going to take the bump got off his spot and gets fouled and we'll go to the free throw line the Chicago team that went 40 and 42 a season to go going to have to defend one of the best inside scores in the NBA from a season ago in Shai Gilgeous Alexander but two free throws here for LaVine getting to the free throw line play Sonic slam tonight for a chance to win a Sonic gift card if a thunder player makes a slam dunk third quarter you could be our lucky winner enter via the Thunder mobile app through the end of halftime for your chance at that gift card well the Thunders you know we talked about it again you know you're picking up where you left off in the preseason just moving the basketball you know you know H Brown used to say when you move the basketball around you make the defense think that's a problem for the defense cuz you can't think and react at the same time Shan right down Main Street took a hack and a foul DeRozan got him straight on the head and Shai hit the deck so two free throws is coming up for him that'll be a familiar spot and you bring up a point Michael about the ball movement from the preseason which was a major theme as you see that hard foul the Grays there on the head of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander but the ball movement for this thunder offense was particularly noticeable over the course of those five preseason games you know the last couple of uh preseason games they had folks 30 assists 31 and 34 now now I know it's preseason but preseason is is a big part of what you're trying to do in preparation for the real season so you you kind of emulate those two and you transition over to what you're seeing tonight as the Thunder been able to get in the scenes with the basketball because you know if you look at it the Bulls don't really have a shot blocker so you know if they're you know if they're not going to get to that painted area fast enough to be able to cut you off I mean just keep attacking the paint they don't have a shot blocker but they still have the rozen taking those mid-range shots as gidey three sales a little bit wide and it looks like Chicago wants to get a couple of substitutions as Billy Donovan also in year number four 58 years old one playoff appearance was Chicago it came in 2022 they lost in the first round there a lot of Talent on this Chicago team you think about LaVine and DeRozan a couple of Allstar appearances each but it just has not translated they battled a bunch of injuries still no Lonzo ball wo is now Giddey trying to defend LaVine deep catch there by Vucevic Coral's inside and he's got the turn around and Vucevic is one of what they kind of call the big three here in Chicago with LaVine and DeRozan oh he's one of those guys who can put up up big numbers former Allstar as well so you have to respect his game there is Holmgren little turnaround shot of the Baseline and Chet Holmgren shows that shooting touch how about the move with the basketball talking about a kid 7' one folks made it look like made it look easy and that is his first career basket so congratulations to him that three came up a little bit flat for Jalen and that must feel pretty good for Chet after sitting out a year and then being able to come back and had the kind of preseason that he had now off to a good start was Demar Derozan uncharacteristically knocks down the corner three he does not take a lot of Threes it is not his first option home gre's going to rumble down the lane count the bucket as he spun it home and took contact and so Holmgren picked up bucket number one goes right back to work on the other end plays through the contact he's going to get to the free throw line he took a hard bump on the lower leg good start to this game car ke ke to the game Michael well how about running the break I mean that's more with the Thunder's identity it's getting the ball off the glass and getting into transition spray the pass we've already talked about how well they pass the ball in preseason continue to do that at the start of the opening tonight and limit the Bulls free throws that's going to be an issue that's going to be more of a management over the next 4 and A2 or three and A2 quarters folks excuse me that was something that we talked about during pregame number one it's first game of the year you want to come out physically defensively and obviously not give them anything easy but you look at the Personnel that Chicago has and you've got guys who like to bait fouls guys who pump fake like Demar DeRozan guys who can get to the free throw line like Zach LaVine and it's something you got to be very conscious of and he's very good at it and you know who else is very good at it in in blue Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and you know in all fairness you know it's it's not a flop it's just a smart move you know shot fake pump fake head fake there's a lot of fakes by the way it's something that they teach you when you're grammar school you ball fake to get your Defender up in the air hey man I've been on that other side before you end up going for one of those fakes oh good job by the Thunder picking up that Loose Change off the floor Dort kept it alive and it leads to another layup this time from Giddey off the Miss from Holmgren and it was just a little extra effort from Dort not to allow that easy defensive rebound and I love to see a big guy getting on the floor you got to give him credit man when you're over 6' n and you get on the floor for a loose ball you got to love that and that's what we were talking about see L Dort a boarding that shot fake by Demar DeRozan he did not bite DeRozan thought he would and then pulled the string on the shot Shai against kuso good defensive player and how about Shai Gilgeous-Alexander so much patience in these never rushed well you know you think you got him and he just slips right through man that's his game he's really beautiful to watch folks it's like Corry in motion hands in there again to force the turnover from Chicago two on one there's the drive and it's Jalen yet again and he has had a solid first quarter so far nine points when he gets out on the break he is so tough to slow down that's why we pointed out one of those key stats is is running that fast break get away with a push on that one maybe not a whole enough to to make the officials put air in that whistle get's pass that's going to be off of a BS Player out of bounds but you know you know this this is not look this is really good defense by the Bulls in all fairness terrific got three white shirts around him uh-uh I'm just saying man he is so clever when he picks up his dribble usually players are happy when a player picks up his dribble that's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander First Team all NBA going up against First Team all defense in Alex Caruso and it looks like we have our first Flop Call of the season I I've been waiting to see one I just don't want to see it called against the Thunder I we waited all preseason really interesting on that shot that we were talking about with Demar DeRozan when he was ging him just a few plays ago and what they do is they at the first break in the action they go look at it and then they turn around and make the decision as to whether or not it was a flop first neutral stoppage yes and so this is the first time that we saw it all season not exactly sure what play it happened on Michael but that is obviously a new rule that's been instituted this year we talked about it a little bit in the pre-season as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander once again trains another three oh you know he's got the total package that's why he was all NBA last season folks shooting over 50% from the field while averaging 31 points a game I mean that's tough to do when you talk about efficiency now partner this is what we were talking about where there's that little nudge and Dort kind of kept going you know out of bounce and and that led to the flopping call and the official one free throw for the Bulls now keep in mind there nothing that warrants ejection it's just an unsportsmanlike conduct that results in a technical free throw at the officials discretion Torrey Craig newly acquired Chicago bull knocks down the three so you can get as many of those as you want in the game cuz it Doesn't you know it's not like it's two regular Tech Tech Les which you're thrown out of the ball game it's like a take foul as Usman Jen had an open look and he drills one from deep and I'm telling you Shai I I cannot say enough about how unselfish he is folks while averaging over 31 points a game last season he also averaged over five assists on plays like that he found his teammates as Javon Carter will knock down backto back threes for the Bulls just in the game as Torrey Craig was on the previous one Bulls getting a little more three-point shooting tough Drive Rugged Drive there is Wiggins picking up that Miss from Giddey always in the right place at the right time and a Wiggins has the deuce and you love that because that's a loose ball I always say Loose Change on the floor you got to pick it up my dad say that's a quarter pick it up I go no pops that's my quarter I picked it up thunder going very small as you see Wiggins and Jang on on the blocks trying to prevent the catch from Vucevic it's Carter another three that one is last Touch by Giddey out of bounds and so just to put a bow on the the new flopping penalty in the rule change going into this year you get awarded a free throw if it is deemed a technical by the official as you said Michael unsportsmanlike technical flout no player rejected and it will result in a free throw just trying to get that aspect out of the game much like they did with the take foul which they did with a lot of success last year man what do you think man that's the first one we' were seeing though I I was waiting all preseason to see we had five preseason games never even came close to it opening night we see our first one and it didn't take very long in the first quarter as Joe Miss fires from Deep have already put up 31 points here in the first quarter DeRozan from the outside can't get his second three and Usman Jang inside grabs that rebound and starts the break he's done a good job of going to go get those balls a lot of his rebounds he had to go get them sometimes they just bounce in your hands folks the other on you got to work a little bit harder for it James got two of them like that going into year two and it's a rare sight where Lu Dort is the one committing an offensive foul usually he is drawing offensive fouls so met immediate timeout here in the first quarter 228 left to go this is our first chance to see what these guys have been doing in the off season all the hard work they've been putting in and one guy who's put in a lot of work this offseason is Jalen Jalen and we'll see why as we take a look at the guy who's bringing you the flavor brought to you by Wingstop take a look at these numbers from Jalen from his rookie season he ranked in the top 10 in five statistical categories among rookies and finished second in Rookie of the Year voting but this approach for Jalen heading into year two is with the mentality that last season didn't earn him anything this season he's aware that he's going to be tested in a lot of different ways teams are going to game plan against him and he's embracing that in fact he spent the summer preparing for those challenges by getting in the weight room and adding a lot of strength which he's already put on and wants to continue that with the growth and development going into year number two and coming out of the timeout Chicago has another three collapse the defense cuz whenever he has the basketball you you pretty much know that they're going to find him good job by Wiggins with Drummond lurking in the area for that rebound now Wiggins trailing the play Shai finds him again in Jen able to tap it out and a fresh 14 Shai on the drive oh what a drive SJ with the left hand he had Craig right on his hip that's tough to do cuz to Torrey Craig's a pretty good Defender that's been a hallmar of his career and Jalen just drove by him sometimes players will watch a terrific score in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander he's not trying to dunk the basketball he's just trying to get to the bucket before the weak side can get there you get Alex Caruso reaching in he blows right by him lays it up flat footed with his left hand such a tough fish something that he was made look easy over the last couple of years tough finishes looking easy but that's what he does and that's what he's got in his game as LaVine is at the free throw line for two and let's take a look at tonight's Parish Devon injury report for both teams Lonzo ball out for the year Jalen hamstring strain still out with back spasms you talk about Shai there's just not enough you can say good things you can say about him playing for Team Canada last summer W bronze medal along with his teammate and Lu Dort and how about this they are two of 26 Canadians to make an opening day roster that's the most in Canadian born players history so not bad well we see more and more International Players entering the NBA more on rosters to start the season than any other St there with 126 international players on NBA rosters that's a trans transition foul that's going to go against OKC and looks like it's going to go against Jalen and we had an opportunity to talk to them Michael obviously going into this season with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Lu Dort being a part of Team Canada but they weren't the only ones Thunder had other players who had an opportunity to play for their national teams there was just so much pride beaming from all of them coming off of that experience not surprising in Canada winning the go the bronze medal you said correct FEA World Cup and it was fun watching CU I was you know Davis Berton and Josh Giddey you know I was like this is great it's a summer we're watching basketball obviously the World Cup is a very Este steam event folks worldwide participation LaVine on the the drive is going to get fouled and so he's already made a couple of trips to the free throw line where he's four for four so already seven free throws these will be free throws eight and nine for Chicago here in this first quarter as we are under a minute cShai Gilgeous-Alexander and Canada and Shai said that that was the highlight of his summer and he always has a very busy summer you see bans for lva Josh Giddey Australia and Shai of course a big part of team can as Lindy Waters is going to jump off the bench mark dagnell bringing some shooting on the floor 53.5 seconds left to go and so far it has been a lot of offense in this first quarter let's check in with Nick well Chris it was a great experience for the guys but also one for Mark digal to be able to watch guys like Josh Giddey in a different role playing for team Australia in different context for Shai and Lu and with different teammates different coaches game planning against those guys was opportunity for Mark to just get a fresh perspective on his own players and then come into the season with some potential new wrinkles for them to work into this Thunder roster always see always interesting to see them in competitive action back to work tonight tough drive from jayb he thought he got fouled didn't get the call it's about a 9 plus second differential between shot and game what has been an offensive filled first quarter LaVine contested on the step back Here Comes Cason Wallace he's making his NBA debut in a regular season obviously he played in the preseason but tonight's the the first one that counts for him and that's a smart play by him to pull the ball out and just look all right you know what we're just going to wind it down to the last second here looks like Joe Joe is going to get called for an offensive foul here trying to set the screen for Jalen and that's something that the Thunder love to do Michael they love to U come on now that's that's terrible he stepped in his way come on Mr referee you can't call that no you think you think that's a little too early to call that you stepped in my way getting on the Uber so what does that say I says okay Chris go get the seat first then okay you you get to pick the seat I'm okay with that come on Final seconds of the first quarter LaVine got to the wing able to get it up in time but short it was contested Oklahoma City how about all the offense of the first quarter the Thunder put up 33 points Chicago puts up 35 points and we are off and running in the 2023 2024 season season number 16 for OKC we'll go to the second from the United Center here in Chicago quarter in the books here in Chicago and both of these teams came out with some offensive heat Michael you look at the shooting percentages OKC over 56 Chicago over 54 Chicago getting some production from its bench but the points in the paint much like last season which we saw from OKC a big Advantage for the Thunder well and you know that you know you're not going to stay at that clip the whole game that's going to be a blocking foul going to be called on Joe but you know you talk about that that first quarter pretty impressive take a look at this he's outside of the uh restricted area you got to challenge that yeah well you know what I think Mark heard me cuz that's terrible he's standing there waiting this shouldn't even be a challenge now now partner explained that challenge rule well we we we'll explain that folks in a minute here there's a new rule here Oklahoma City is challenging the ruling of a defensive foul on the play all right so 13 seconds into the second quarter we get our first challenge of the year it comes from the Thunder and Mark dnel challenge was successful and no surprise because Joe he's planted he's outside the restricted area and he had enough time to wrap some Christmas presents because he was waiting for Zach LaVine and he was on the charge chart last year Michael with a bunch of other Thunder players but there is a new wrinkle to the coach's challenge in 2324 if you get your first challenge correct which Mark dagnal just did you are awarded a second challenge as that is going to be a foul on Tor Craig so in previous years if you used your challenge whether you were successful or not that was the only challenge that you got but more like what they do in the NFL where if you get the first one right you get a second now if you get your second one right it doesn't matter that's it you don't get a third so you only get a second but in order to use your second challenge you have to have a timeout right and we talked about this last year and I think you know just talking with a lot of our colleagues around the league they certainly are really happy to see this rule come to parition there's just too many possessions and potentially too many mistakes and giving coaches another opportunity to get something right particularly in a critical time of the game is the right thing to do and there's people that don't like the fact that it it it might slow the game down but I think getting the call right is probably more important yeah and for more on Joe taking charges let's check in with Nick well guys there was a little internal chatter and debate during training camp about who who is going to take the most charges in Camp and then this year of course Joe taking the first one of the season for this team it was actually Lu D who took two charges on the first day of practice in training camp that really ignited that conversation so just good to see that these guys are fired up about the hustle plays as much as they are about the dunks you could make a legitimate argument for probably three or four guys Jalen Joe maybe even Lu Dort there's Joe stepping behind the tape he took a shot Zach LaVine fouled him behind the three-point line and that'll be three free throws for Joe who is always hunting a three-point shot well watch The Landing folks and this is an easy call here for the official right there and you know you cannot go under the player he's allowed to go up and come down in his Landing space and Joe in all fairness he's got the total package in terms of he can shot pi and get to the basket we saw him do that a lot last year where he dunked the basketball and and he's a you know he's a deadly three-point shooter so in all fairness to Zach LaVine you got to close out on him pretty quickly it's just that you got to be careful that this doesn't happen that's certainly what you focus on first but he is not onedimensional as Joe knocks down the second and he he said multiple times over the course of the preseason he knows that he's got to be ready for that secondary action to be able to make a move particularly off the catch off the dribble just opening up different aspects of his offensive game because of situations like that Michael where you've got Defenders closing out on heart that's right and he understands too coming off the bench too what that means as well you you never guaranteed minutes you can get two minutes or you can get 20 you just got to play the game already there were two screens set for Coby Wright as Wallace got a body and Holmgren got a body the Thunder defense keeps its Integrity there to knock it out of bounds yeah that first one was a Whopper by Andre drumond right he's a big body sets a big screen by four the biggest body out on the floor white on the drive Holmgren effecting the shot KCK out to a corner three it's a little bit flat there is Drummond offensive rebound he's caught on the Baseline Carter nearly turned it over it's a 50/50 ball they're going to call a foul on Joe who was just trying to catch it but LaVine had the positioning and and once LaVine gained possession it was Joe who banged his body yeah and you know this is one of those 50-50 balls and you know leine did a good job of getting both Ms on it first there's that contact a good call by the official no no harm but a foul well last year at this time it's a lot less known about Joe in his game he was cut by the Philadelphia 76ers signed by OKC Coby white got away with a push good defense by Cason Wallace staying down forcing the tough shot now Torrey Craig on the Baseline he's going to keep it alive for the Bulls and it looks like Chicago is going to take a timeout and we will take a break with them early minutes of the second quarter game number one out Lots made of the lineup changes I think one of the benefits of keeping things fluid is you uh hopefully we're developing a an Adaptive muscle with the team where regardless of who's on the court the guys are kind of reacting to one another and um learning each other on the Fly um and so integrating a new player with different strengths you know is nothing new for us and nothing new for our players uh and they're not challenges you know we have good young players that want to play together and that want to compete together and um those are opportunities and you know we're not going to be perfect tonight we won't be perfect at any point but this the one thing I have you know unending confidence in is this ability this group's ability to learn from their experiences and that was L head coach Mark dagnal in tonight's U health Coach's Corner and there's a couple of things that he's referencing we've seen the continuity from this Thunder team but there's also a system in place but there was some action on that previous play with Drummond as Drummond got the dunk but hung on the rim a little too long and so he got teed up yeah he he he did some back some bicep curls you you're only supposed to do that in the gym some pull-ups I think he'll remember it next time take a look at this folk he going to pull himself up see a little okay that's that's going to get that's going to get you hit with the citation I'm always impressed on a situation like that that the rim is so strong that he can literally do a pullup and it has no effect on the rim of the backboard That's How Strong well it's been tried and tested by Shaquille O'neal He did break a backboard though and Daryl Dawkins so technology is improved now Drummond with the steel now Drummond on the drive and Drummond with the left hand that is not a play you see from him very often particularly out on the perimeter and then keeping the basketball Joe Catch Fire three that is good Cason Wallace set him up and Joe is able to drain the triple his game is like money I mean I'm talking about when that guy walks on the court you just say money that was a beautiful shot beautiful pass too got a big guy in there likes to hang around the paint and Drummond you got to make him move his feet and get him away from the basket Patrick no on the turnaround shot and Cason Wallace quickly into the front Court finds the cut of Wiggins but it was deflected by Patrick now white first with speed Holmgren on his backside effed the layup but commits the foul and so Holmgren picks up his first foul his first personal as things have slowed up a little bit from that rapid Pace that we saw in all that offense in the first quarter little bit different here to open up the second quarter at least for the first 3 minutes and 12 seconds as white will go to the free throw line countd down to the Thunder home opener is on be at paycom Center Sunday October 29th at p.m. to see the Thunder take on nicoa yic in the rigning NBA champion Denver Nuggets doors open at 1: p.m. tickets are available now at OKC thunder.com slash by tickets and that'll be a fun one get there early lot of buzz in the building tonight going to be a lot of Buzz at payop center from the home opener going up against the Nuggets Joe off the block and Coby white as the ball swings over to Patrick got a size Advantage Patrick a little turnaround shot and he get the friendly bounce soft back iron so Patrick now in his fourth year he was a top five pick out of Florida State Jalen got caught in the air and it results in a turnover now Torey Craig Craig down the lane out to White Off the drier three and he left it short and now the Thunder one to run it is Wiggins but Jalen tried to thread that pass in transition and he's fortunate that it got knocked out of bounds last Touch by Chicago well with that big lineup now now Drummond is going to go out of the game and and the starters going to come back in for the Bulls that's how you want to play up and down don't allow him to be affected by just sitting in the paint trying to deflect shots and get offensive rebounds on both or on the offensive end and defensive on the other Giddey how about the bounce pass right across the Baseline and it sets up Lu Dort for that corner three you you you know the skill it takes to make that pass from that distance on the opposite they don't teach that okay that's why he's good at it because he he got good at something that you just don't teach a lot and he made it look so casual too had the ball little two-handed pass up above his head Shai turn for Corner stops on the Baseline so smooth Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's got himself 13 first half points Thunder back on top too with those last two by Shai and that smooth Baseline pass by Josh Giddey on the set piece it is just so remarkable how good he is at getting to where he wants to get to on the floor well you can just tell he's just in control as Vucevic passes into the first row how about this folks look at this here he's on one side okay high school players don't do this cuz you're going to end up on the bench you're going to be over on the sideline with me and Chris Nick and Paris and you're going to come out of the game because that guy knows what doing he's been doing that since he was 14 years old and Michael the angle is what is so impressive because if that bounce is out of bounds or touches the Baseline it's a turnover so much can go wrong and and he makes it go right every time like that folks Olivier saw out on the floor for the first time Joe little wide on that three on the left side is DeRozan trying to lob it over to vvi as Sarr getting his first minutes of the game up top it's DeRozan that's going to be a deep two not close down for the Bulls that's why they got the one-point lead oh look at Shai just dismiss Patrick Shai Gilgeous-Alexander just smooth like butter absolutely Parker took the words right out of my mouth I'm I'm I'm like licking my lips I don't know why I mean it's the first thing that came to mind zumu outside three no good so Chicago's threes drying up after the quick start on the first quarter as Giddey off that Chicago switch as Joe finds an open man out on the perimeter Shai Gilgeous-Alexander again look at the ball just snap over to Dort D's going to let it fly not close shot clock winding down but it's saved back to the Bulls DeRozan outside to White swings it down to Patrick shot clock I don't think the shot clock restarted that's Mark D saying but it leads to a white three wouldn't have mattered he would have got it off in time and so Coby white who shooting has improved despite his confidence fluctuating significantly over the last couple of years as Sarr tried to fire it down to Giddey the reverse layup and that one a little too strong Jalen an orthodox delivery despite all those points in the first quarter both these teams starting to settle in but look like that gidy pass got deflected white wants to go one-onone with Joe side steps him and lays it up and in with just about 4 and A2 minutes remaining here in the first half Shai that'll be an easy foul who's and that's a smart play also by Shai there's a misu miss hand off as white Gets In transition for the Bulls but that's a great way to bust up a rhythm of a team is just's get a foul just a slow it down for a second Bulls want a nice little run after the thunder on a nice little run you know get a foul slow it down reset your clock now Dort lot of white jerseys got caught inside gy able to rescue The Possession but now just 3 seconds drives Baseline has to put it up and he got fouled with5 seconds left on a possession that was going absolutely nowhere the Thunder will welcome that with open arms I'm not sure who did it but it's one of those plays you go uh yeah uh yeah this is uh yeah Alex Caruso uh all defensive right yeah not on that play we was just just scratched that one but man he bailed the Thunder out gave him a fresh 14 all defensive first team a season to go now trying to defend Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and we get contact as Shai went flying across the Baseline and that'll be another Chicago foul and I believe the Bulls are in the penalty which will put Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at the free throw line here with four and change we on the clock second quarter he's kind of shaking up on the too he got poked in the eye it looked like by Patrick yeah TOS TOS that was kind of one of those just kind of like the a lazy reach and and you know this is where you really like the officiating too because they got the they got the the uh ball Personnel on the Baseline kind of cleaning up while it allows Shai to kind of shake it off if he can for a second cuz when you get Poke tonight there ain't no remedy for that but time you know I'm just saying it just takes time you know for y ey to stop watering and this is why this guy is so good folks because he got to the free throw line at over 90% clip last season he was on Pace a lot of times you know where he had 20 30 in a row shooting 95% for a while there during the season that's a big part of his game too too because he attracts a lot of attention that's why he gets to that free throw line a lot just been incredible watching him Elevate his game on a year-to-year basis now going into year six getting to the free throw line was a big part of it a season too already with 17 first half points DeRozan little off on the mid-range shot good job by luk Dort coming in to help out Dort walk it the hit ahead pass to D roen too much speed and he cannot track it down and fich upset with himself as he pounds the floor on the other end well big guys have a tendency to throw the ball with a lot of Steam on it and Jay went up for the jam fich tried to deny him at The Rim but a foul on fich yeah that's an easy call for the officials Coby white kind of upset Vucevic is not but this is just a strength watch this here as he go gos up he got him on the arm I don't know why that U Coby white was really upset about that I think there was clear contact you look at him right there on the elbow not even close yeah did he even touch the ball on that play I'm not really sure but this is you know you're driving to the basket now you've settled down you know you're kind of throwing you know a lot of punches at each other right now and that you know you everybody's waiting for the Haymaker these two teams just been going back and forth here folks all first half here 336 remaining now the Thunder back out on top by two Jalen into double digits with the 11th under half the two-point lead as white flared out momentarily peruso can knock down the three gave it right back to White his three off and so Chicago is really dried up from outside the three-point line Giddey once again has it taken away DeRozan took it right back to him so Wonder have had some careless turnovers on drives Vucevic the trail three no the Bulls are now five out of 20 from downtown just 25% yeah they were what 40% in that first quarter 4 10 Jalen couldn't get the bounce on that corner three had some uncharacteristic turnovers here in the first half team that really took care of the ball a season ago DeRozan just looking for a little bit of contact he was off balance he got the contact and so DeRozan will make his second trip to the line leading score so far for Chicago the six time Allstar in his 15th year 34 years old now a quick word from your Oklahoma Ford just looking back at Demar DeRozan and he's 34 years year 15 Michael you go back to his first opening night was back in 2009 when he was a member of the Toronto Raptors went up against the Cleveland Cavaliers think about this you know who was on that Cleveland Cavaliers team what what year 2009 Carlos Boozer no Shaq Shaq was Shaq could not believe it talk about that connection we were just talking about him earlier in the first quarter as one of those guys who used to bend the rim and break it he could certainly do that some shattered glass as the ball tipped back out to Caruso trying to go inside now to Vucevic skip pass over to a wide open shooter it's Craig right the side of the backboard almost had too much time Giddey hard charging the other way just bounc is off of Craig not a problem goes right to the rack for the scoop and score it's just a terrific heads up play I mean he just beat everybody down the floor you're talking about a 6'8 point guard haven't seen one like that since Magic Johnson similar game passer learning to use his body just do not shy away from defensive players as the blls just continue to lay bricks from Deep Giddey finds himself open takes it advantage and drains the triple and that's just good ball movement what you make two passes pass half court you get a wide open three and those are the threes that Josh Giddey likes when he's got space and his open and that time Shai found him that's why spacing is so important in the NBA folks this is a pace and space lead looks like white was out of control on the drive but he's going to get the the foul according to James capers how about this look at as he gets the ball middle of the floor back Court and goes Coast to Coast with that Big Frame here again spacing just a smart play look everybody's in the paint I step out we like the space to the floor this is to our identity you got an unselfish guy who was fourth in the league in scoring last year and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander passing you the basketball and that's really been something that we've heard so much over the course these last couple of weeks the the unselfishness of this team and this roster Michael and the willingness to set up and drills it from Deep yeah and Vucevic was like okay I'm going to give you a little bit of room and that's what happens now that just opens up the floor when you're knocking down threes like that and you got your your gu is playing that Five Spot doing that Craig finally ends the second quarter drought for Chicago and Craig is really the only one that's been able to consistently knock down a shot for the Bulls from the outside all nine points coming from behind the arc yeah and coming off the bench as well he's been a super serup so far Shai once again finds the open man Jay resp responds with a corner three and that's why aav is over five assists okay he's all NBA first team over 31 points over five assists and he shot over 50% from the field but he's so unselfish with the basketball as he found Jalen with a three ball in the corner pocket the Thunder not affected by Chicago's struggles from Deep 4 second differential between the shot clock and the game clock is vuich set that screen for white over to Caruso he will drive in Nifty move Caruso scores with a finger roll Giddey got across mid court and that shot on the run is way off but was a thunder catching a little fire there Mike at the end of the second quarter from Deep we got a three from Jalen a three from Josh Giddey and it's Oaklahoma City going into the locker room with a six-point lead is John rigan and oyce young will take you through halftime and get you set up for the second half as a thunder on the road here in the regular season opener Josh we go home with a $50 Sonic gift card let's get an update from Paris thanks Chris well the Thunder knew that this Chicago defense was going to be a good test for its offense tonight and I spoke to thunder assistant coach Eric mayor at halftime who told me that OKC's done a really good job of handling that defense so far there have been a few turnovers but that can be solved with some Advanced passes getting the ball ahead of the defense and overall they're doing a really good job offensively the focus here defensively in the second half is on making sure that guys like Demar DeRozan and Zach LaVine are uncomfortable because they know they're going to come out of halftime aggressive so it's about making other guys beat them out there on the floor guys all right thank you Paris well the Thunder defense certainly made Zach LaVine uncomfortable in that first half Mike he was 0 for five which is six points all of his scoring coming from the free throw line and the Thunder defending the three-point shot well and Chicago is just 6 for 23 26% and that's why the thunder going into this third quarter with a 6155 lead that's right partner would you see 52% on the road a home opener for the Bulls and you only turn the ball over three times in the entire half that's pretty efficient so Chicago opens up quarter number three with the basketball is DeRozan searching for his spot got to his spot and shoots it over the top of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander two players who love to take that mid-range J yeah that's why he averaged over 24 points a game last season with shots like that now he'll take the three but about 80% of his shots are coming from that mid-range there is LaVine looking for his first shot and there is his first shot to go down LaVine and so LaVine nine points and just like that Chicago opens up the scoring here in quarter number three well you know Zach Zach Liv he's a streaky shooter and he's one of those guys who can get a going backto back turnovers on back-to-back possessions for OKC to open up the third white drives J up trying to keep up with him he cannot do it little burst of speed and just like that it is seven points out of the blocks here in the third for Chicago and the Bulls retake the lead season tournament that begins on November 3rd a completely new element to the schedule that's going to be in the regular season as you can see there are three PODS of five teams in each conference the winner of each pod will go on to the quarterfinals plus two wildcard teams for the inaugural inseason tournament and the winner will win the NBA cup as you can see the Thunder there in group C as games begin on November 3rd they're going to go all the way into early December each team plays four teams in the group once two home two away and as we said the winners of each group and two wild guard teams will go to The Knockout round games will be on Tuesdays and Fridays the Thunder first game will be November 3rd against the Golden State Warriors at payop Center they they're in the Pod with the Warriors the Kings Minnesota and the Spurs S out of the timeout a little short on the three and so that halftime Thunder lead has all but disappeared Michael all the fans who are late arriving to their seats now see that Chicago is up now the bulls turn it over it's a three-on-one G's going to take it himself and finish off the fast break off the turnover and that's how you get your Collective footings back together coming out of a halftime with the bulls that on that 70 run force a turnover get out in transition that's her favorite Attack Mode is being able to get that downhill play as DeRozan will get downhill as well for the Bulls that was like a Runway he had all kinds of space Jalen nearly had it taken away by WillPatrickiams there his last Touch by Patrick you know back back to that playin tournament I like it cuz it's kind of like you know the Euro Cup the English cup President's Cup you know so you get two Champions you get two championship you know you get the End season Chet championship trophy and then you get the NBA uh championship trophy so you know I I think that's going to be really really fun to watch folks and it starts pretty quickly in no rumbl NBA trying to create a competitive element in the regular season how about Josh gidy just not deterred at all from physical contact once again goes off glass you know and he does a good job cuz he has still doesn't get the calls he deserves a lot of time driving to the bucket boy that about that tough step back by Zach LaVine got it over the outstretched arm of Jalen and you do not want Zach LaVine getting hot and he can do that J fires it back out to the perimeter as Giddey wants that screen from Usman Jang Jang got it right back open three high arer and he bottoms it you know what I like most of all about that is is that his footwork you got to watch that folks I mean he looked like he was stepping to the basket get a couple little step back and he was lined up right to take that shot Mark dagnal says he's more comfortable in the offensive system he's got great instincts as dork little late on the play launched up that three but no good A lot of times you see young players you know they put up be all kind of little out of place a lot of times when they're stepping out to try to get a quick shot and he was shoulder squared on that one still just 20 years old and now fronting the passing Lane on vuich as LaVine defended by Dort goes left got caught amongst the Defenders on the interior and it's going to be Chicago ball with 1.4 seconds on the shot clock how about this is taken a contact could have been an n one easily gold white slapping him on the arm here again just you know again on the contact and then kicking out to a shooter oh and the offensive rebound leads to the extra shot as LaVine starting to heat up here in the third quarter he's got two threes and a two and Chicago still with that lead here early minutes of the third Patrick been trying to defend Shai on the night now Shai with the step back and he rips the cords from downtown you know what I'm going to say man I've been waiting to say it too that's nasty man they're thinking he's going to drive they thinking he's going to drive try to get to the mid-range I don't know folks he can shoot that three-point shot he did not take a ton of Threes last year almost completely eliminated out of his game but he's already taken five here not get Midway through quarter number three he's two for five he's got 20 points Jalen wants a three of his own and the rebound to vuich so average the double double last season Giddey trying to slow the progress of white is Will Giddey and all kinds of congestion finds the cut there is Jalen on the reverse and the pretty finish that's pretty that's not pretty that's pretty folks I mean that's just also terrific ball movement guy gets stuck in the paint picks up his dribble no problem he's got his teammates moving out without the basketball this is what was happening in the preseason guess what folks it's happen happening in the regular season right now it's opening night sophomore season where he impacted the game on all three levels scoring rebounding and assisting he's done all three tonight as well you see him finish out in transition got on the run on that 301 break here he is attacking physically downhill that was a huge emphasis for him this summer in FEA competition and then doing what he does best picking out the right pass at the right moment finding his teammates from behind the arc and on the Baseline for that slippery bounce pass to Jalen Josh Giddey he got 13 four and four tonight doing a little bit of everything yeah thank you Nick and as you said affecting the game on different levels in the Thunder after taking that early punch here in the third quarter and surrendering the lead in a game that has had a lot of different lead changes the thunder come right back and are on top white shot clocked under one and the Thunder defense this time Stands Tall to force a 24 second violation and now folks that's called a shell drill in practice no matter what it is high school college NBA you practice practice that drill where you try to stop the offense from scoring and getting a shot clock violation that work to Perfection gy SLI it inside to dort but dort got rejected by Vucevic Boy Pretty play design D just ran into the tower Patrick caugh caught on the lane there's to DeRozan trying to go to work on Jalen again the shot clock winding down under 5 Seconds a deep three white cannot connect that's back to back really good defense to force the offense into tough shots also want a lot of pressure from that shot clock violation Shai gives it up again gy open three and he cashes it in as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander once again setting up his teammate for a wide open three he's just seeing a big basket right now and he's also finding his teammates doing a good job of being the floor General out there as well a couple of weeks ago celebrated his 21st birthday Thunder finding some efficient threes in this third quarter really since the second is white got dislodged off his spot and he's going to get free throws first foul here in the third quarter pass the Midway Point Shai could have gotten a foul call on that look at all the attention he draws from the white shirts and he does a good job of finding his teammates Giddey once again spotting up Beyond The Arc with that facing he's got two threes that exact way up your game with the official Thunder shop check out the latest drops exclusive merch and more visit the Thunder shop at paycom Center or shop anytime online at OKC thunder.com shop and I think sometimes folks you have you you have to stay with me on this partner those two kind of mirror each other with the basketball when they draw attention they're willing to give up the basketball that's exactly what Josh Giddey and Shai is doing you know being a former player of this league you love to play with a guy like that because you know he's going to give up the basketball I mean he's a big time scorer I'm talking about Shai he's going to you know he's a big time scorer over 31 a game last season fourth in the NBA but he's also willing to you know find his teammates and that's what's been so impressive about his game and the progression of his game because it's not like he's hogging shots from his teammates and once again he sets up Jang and another wide openen three from the outside and Jane showed a lot of discipline too cuz a lot of times you want to you know you want to run to the basket when you see a guy drive and he just stayed out there towed that line and was rewarded all the points tonight from Jen coming via the three outside Caruso but he answers back for a bulls three Caruso very capable 36% undrafted player out of Texas a&n that's going to miss one can't throw the ball back to him and you know when you talk about spacing that's that's been the Thunders offense the last two or three possessions down and for more on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander let's check in with Paris well guys you were talking about Shai and how well he is playing off the ball and and we talked to him about this kind of unselfish behavior and he he tells us that you know the best teams that have played the games the teams that have won the most championships won the most games theyve played together and he referenced the Last Dance documentary and how Michael Jordan had to learn the offense and play with his team teammates he said you know if Michael Jordan had to do it I got to do it too guys no doubt about it all the great teams have had great players and they've all played off the ball Shai willing to do it Jalen got inside and that ball pinball finishing in the mid range Shai got caught Joe trying to keep it from going out of bounds and that'll be a thunder turnover you just see all the attention Michael and you brought this point up there's two three Defenders trying to collapse on shape every single time that he gets inside it's leaving his teammates open and he's certainly a willing passer but just very interesting to see all the Defenders that are going his way yeah I got three words for you on that get your hands ready cuz the ball's coming and he's going to try to get it out to you had a couple of textbook plays like that in this quarter already off of drives and kicks LaVine finally cools off after knocking down the first couple of shots of the third Caruso all defensive first team going up against all NBA Shai trying to back him down tough shot on the fade away didn't quite get it up to the rim Caruso was in good position defensively as LaVine bear in right to the rim left it short with that left-handed flick and here comes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Thunder put just enough pressure on him for him to miss that layup Thunder will give the ball back to the Bulls but that's what you got to do with a guy like Zach leavine he's trying to get started he's already put up the couple of good buckets in this quarter already you force him to miss a transition layup you've done your job yeah thunder made it difficult on him three out of 11 Coby white is three out of 11 and the veterans Javon Carter and Torrey Craig return for the Bulls Wallace the rookie now getting the assignment on LaVine as the ball goes down to Vucevic lowers the shoulder Vucevic using his size just bouncing off of Chet Holmgren right this has been a great game no double digit leads team stretches kind of mirroring one another Shake takes a body bump and somehow contorts just enough to spin it home man that that is just terrific that is just terrific take a look at this folks I mean watch the elevation last second just Scoops it in he is so plant just so creative around the bucket I mean they had him that's good defense that's just a you know a better offense I mean that's the question how do you defend that I you know would you asking me what what do you think I am the color analyst or something you were the I I know most the interior defender back in the day you were the enforcer how do you defend that I don't I you some things you just just got to scratch your head say all right man you know that's just a great player doing some great things uh folks on that last dead ball situation that was a technical foul on Vucevic for slamming the ball down after that score by sh and the ball pops out here is Joe and besides the flare it out to create a little bit of space Shai again on Caruso step back shot right at the elbow not a problem that's just you know that's just smart basketball 101 coverage from an all NBA Defender to an all NBA a first team player and Shai Shai starting to heat up as that three sails wide from Javon Carter out of bounds how about that battle between those two First Team all NBA defensive team for Caruso First Team all NBA for Shai going at it that's why you love this game folks that's why you're going to show up early at on Sunday afternoon cuz that's where these guys will be so Cason Wallace handling the point unsure where to go at the basketball playing in his first NBA game pulls up for that shot and rattles it in Cason Wallace Off the Bench for Mark dnal in the Thunder playing professional game number one picking up where some guys left off before he came into the ball game that's going to be a trip now it was inadvertent but he left that leg out there was drumming F was right on top of it you know there's got to be some nerves for him coming in and and obviously Cason Wallace he played in the preseason but still a little bit different when the games count and you here on the road in Chicago one of the great Arenas here the United Center is Aaron Wiggins got collapsed on no call here come the Bulls Craig over to Caruso Corner three no good and it's Wiggins with the rebound hustling back down the floor this is kind of letting them play a little bit right now loud contact on both ends as players you got to make that ingame adjustment Wallace from the outside and he's got himself a three off another pass from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder have their biggest lead of the night it sits at 11 getting double figures by either Team all night how about this folks there been 20 lead changes in this ball game oh Wiggins somehow was able to stay off the body of DeRozan who is trying to draw the foul Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Little Euro Step In spins it in it's a 120 Thunder Run final minute of the third well they're doing a good job of just forcing turnovers and then they're picking it up on the other end by putting it in the basket running that transition offense so out a lot of teams and DeRozan somehow squeezes his way through two defensive players as Mark dnal wants to thunder to move quickly Wiggins off peruso no whistle ball swings up the he'll pull the trigger on a three and here come the Bulls and Torrey Craig to close out this third quarter and what an eventful last couple of minutes it's been shot clock is off D roosen surang and thunder not in the penalty so well a smart play Mark dag was looking at Wiggins wiggin was looking at Mark dagal said look okay you're going to let a little time go off this clock and when he make his move to the basket because you can file him you're not going to put him in a penalty they just have a shorter clock to work with so it's a nice smart move to shorten the clock for the Bulls Mark Danel brings in Dort little defense for offense Joe's sits down 4.8 seconds left don't want to foul and put him at the free throw line home for the steal gambled and lost because it allowed Drummond to get a free Lane to the r and that'll close out the third quarter and it was a solid third quarter particularly the last five minutes fueled by a 120 Thunder Run they caught fire from three see Wiggins smartly laying off that pump fake and it leads to the run out and help fuel that 12 O charge Thunder had the lead to it how about this one between the Thunder and the Bulls as we go to the fourth quarter 20 lead changes es it has been back and forth all night long Chicago though taking a little advantage of the Thunder getting a little loose with the basketball 14 thunder turnovers very uncharacteristic 22 points off and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the mix of so much of what the Thunder doing offensively Michael obviously he's got the 27 points starting this fourth quarter on the bench but he has set up so many of his teammates as G's first shot of the fourth quarter is a little bit off but the Thunder have a nine-point lead the Chicago with the basketball as DeRozan makes it a seven-point game well you know Thunder watch at the end of the third quarter they shot over 52% from the field they were at 56% at halftime so you kept the offense lit you had a 30- point quarter that's what you want to keep doing what a way to get on the board here at the top part of this third quarter with that three ball by Joe well the three ball has been a weapon tonight for OKC 43% 14 out of 32 and Joe just knocked down his second Caruso from the sideline that one in and out no good and how about Joe grabbing that rebound and starting the break it is Wallace the rookie Joe jayb Sarr and Giddey on the floor for Mark dnal to open up quarter number four Giddey trying to go to work Joe yet again the beat set and once again splashes home another three and once you know once again it's coming off dribble penetration and they're collapsing the defense and then kicking it out to Shooters nothing fancy about it folks they're just rinse washing and repeating it until the Bulls make the adjustment DeRozan didn't want to Chuck the three so instead goes to his game that little turnaround shot Jalen was all over him defensively have done a good job of not biting for his shot fakes tonight and Wallace has himself another three as the threes are flying here in Chicago and the Thunder have opened it up a 16-point game as Joe and Cason Wallace lien it up from downtown well you're loving what's happening we talked about it collapsing the defense then kicking out the shooters has advertised folks how about this kid here he's a rookie case Wallace that's his second three this is an unselfish Thunder team to the tune of 21 assists on the night that is creating some high quality looks offensively for this group shooting 41% from the three-point line knocking down 13 three-pointers and it all comes from the space and the pace that this team wants to play with offensively they are such an unselfish group and Josh kiddy told us that this is a group that wants to make the right play they know that making the extra pass is so critical to getting this offense going the way they want to go and finding the best shots out there on the floor and there's a Chicago turnover Joe got his hand in the lane that should be a goal 10 and it is on Caruso trying to recover and that leads to another two for Oklahoma City who are on another extended double digit run here early minutes of the fourth quarter and Joe's steel easy call Easy call for the officials that ball was clearly over the cylinder can't touch it when it's up there but you know that's where your defense is creating your offense you steal the ball out front you create your own offense right now the Bulls are kind of stunned here trying to Fig trying to get their foot back together th rozen didn't settle for the jumper that time he took it to the rim and laid it up and in I mean collectively it wasn't a bad half of basketball for the Bulls the Thunder all of a sudden turned it on offensively at the bottom part of that third quarter the three-point shot has been such an advantage and that time Jalen set it up for Olivier Sarr right at The Rim you know when he's that long he just you know throw the ball by the rim and I'm going say the same thing for Chet too both of them have good hands and they got good feel around the rim right now they're forcing the Bulls to work the full 24 seconds of the shot clock which is winding down right now DeRozan hand in the face and Giddey had it taken away by Craig Craig stays with it and finally on the third effort uncharacteristic from Josh Giddey usually strong with the ball in his hands if you're OKC you want to keep this Bulls offense out of rhythm and it has been out of rhythm pretty much since Midway through the third quarter that Midway through the third quarter when the Bulls took the lead and J almost kicked that one out of bounds but it's going to stay with OKC with 3.5 seconds left on the shot clock hey you go back to the half time Michael with the Thunder had that six-point lead Chicago comes out takes the lead immediately just over a minute in the third quarter Mark dnal calls the timeout and this young Thunder team has responded here in the second half Zach leine got it going for a minute Dort got to put it up but he's on his knees and that'll be a thunder turnover quiet night so far for Dort offensively but he has been pressuring LaVine well the did a good job too when they put that big line line up in there with Andre Drummond cuz he was getting a lot of offensive rebounds in that first half that didn't happen here in the second half BS continue to hunt threes but just nine out of 34 that is not their game they take under 33s a game going back to last season taking 34 but that that's just not their strength Giddey dribbles it off of his foot but still time Craig is all over him gives him another dribble Giddey drives floats back iron no good Sarr got fouled you could hear it from here as he got that slap on the arm and you know that's a big play for the thunder right there because the Bull's trying to get something started off that offensive rebound by Torrey Craig that's a loose ball it's bouncing around like a pinball and somehow you come up with it off of a missed shot now you got free throws both teams have gone to the peo line a whole lot this game see the Thunder your way with a flexible ticket package with packages starting at Just 4 games you can mix and match tickets to fit your needs build yours today at OKC thunder.com partial plans free throws are pretty much even Thunder have attempted 16 the Bulls have attempted 17 it hasn't felt like a free throw game though and that's what Chicago wants though remember we talked about that that was one of the keys to the game is is keep the Bulls off that free throw line so far the Thunder have done that you see the battle for positioning away from the basketball between Sarr and vuvi and that'll be foul number two on OKC check that foul number one according to the scoreboard and I like that bigger body on vvi because he likes to post up deep and do his dirty work early now with Sarr in there he's a very physical guy not afraid of contact ah LaVine and that's going to be an a one that was just a good play design by Chicago Thunder got caught a little bit between Sarr and Dort chasing LaVine and then that slit pass yeah that's that's a good cut that's a really nice cuz you know bvic he's a pick and pop guy but that's what he wants to do mostly CU that's he does a lot of his damage inside cutting to the basket posting up he's been trying to post up all game as he completes the three-point play well the Thunder have this double digit lead thanks to the three-point shot and production From the Bench 37 bench points which was such an asset for OKC last year they were a top 10 bench team Michael at over 37 points per game that was eighth in the NBA as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander he was back out on the floor in his 27 points he's obviously helped Pace the starters and everybody but the Thunder getting a ton of bench production yet again well and it takes a it's a a total team effort it takes a total team effort throughout the entire season with your starters and your PCH s that one is going the other way Patrick the one waiting to absorb that blow from Olivier Sarr player who Mark dagnold says that the Thunder trust despite Sarr being on a two-way deal Jalen waiting for the contact good call I think that's a really good call we saw that in the first half with Joe taking one but the Thunder had to challenge that to get it overturned that exact same play lvi again calling for it Dort trying to chase LaVine and LaVine just misfired from three it has been an off night for Zach LaVine the two time Allstar led the blls in scoring a season to go SJ got to his spot can't get the bounce that time and that'll be a loose ball foul on the rookie Cason Wallace just trying to battle for the basketball and realize sometimes you don't want to give away those cheap ones particularly in the fourth quarter you get excited I mean it's it's opening night for his career Cason Wallace first round draft pick out of Kentucky you think about Cason Wallace making his his debut tonight professional debut and thunder have able to Short Circuit the Chicago offense Dort again trying to chase LaVine good close out by Wallace on Patrick another good close out LaVine has to put it up to beat the shot clock he did beat the shot clock it was contested But Here Comes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and that was a really good disciplined close out by lud Dort on Zach LaVine and another open three set up by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander cashed in by Wallace okay two things don't in this second half has not missed a field goal and for a free throw all of it coming here in the second half he's four for four as dorts going to pick up that loose ball and Cason Wallace he made that left elbow jumper Michael and I think that might have just settled him in here in the second half because he hasn't missed as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on a step back he's got 29 and the lead for the Thunder swells up to 20 and the fans at the United Center not pleased with this second half eruption from the Thunder Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's had his fingerprints all over it GD power play in the game and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander getting out on the Run has been putting electricity into this thunder offense all night long Michael and if his numbers look like they did last year it's because they do he's got 29 Points on eight assists on a very efficient night well you're loving what you're seeing because a lot of his moves are like sweet mother of pearl moves like how did he do it as he been squeezing between two Defenders and when they've closed that lane he's kicked out the shooters too all right Nick what do you got for us well with Shai it always comes back to the work you know we see him slithering around through Defenders but this all comes from the stuff he does behind closed doors on Sunday after practice he was out there for an additional 30 minutes beyond what any other player was going one on three against Thunder assistant coaches two of those guys loaded up on him at the perimeter and one was down on the block with a big stick with a p on the end of it Shai has certainly learned how to duck and Dodge and dip around all those Defenders and he has had a tremendous impact on the environment here with OKC is LaVine out of the timeout Thunder have controlled the second half Jay once again on a little stop and pop woo it is pretty and he is cooking that's all I can say right now folks I'm kind of speechless cuz that's a nice move against a really terrific Defender he just put on the brakes such an impressive night for him is hen's going to push vuich in the back the Thunder have had two significant runs in this game Michael 120 in the third quarter 110 early in the fourth quarter just a completely Wrangle away control of this game I mean this game is is a lot closer than what you think I mean you know if you look at the score right now you wouldn't think that but there was 20 lead changes in this ball game folks 20 oh excuse me I I stand corrected yeah I do stand stay on my wording 20 lead changes and seven ties well we were talking over the break just about the difference in the three-point shooting between these two teams it is Stark the Bulls have been laying bricks since the first quarter 24% 9 out of 37 his home Ring's going to get hacked and fouled he's going to get a trip to the line the Thunder 17 out of 35 48% Michael but there is a difference in the quality of the shots that both these teams are taking because we've seen so many wideopen looks for the Thunder and so many contested shots for the Bulls well they're making that extra pass and that extra pass is creating that open shot all Five Guys on the Flor to the play tonight have been very unselfish with the basketball hey Thunder fans planning to attend our home opener on Sunday make sure you're at paycom Center when doors open at 1 p.m. and be ready to greet your thunder as they hit the court and tip off the season that'll be against the defending chance the Denver Nuggets and what a great way to get things going at home at paycom Center back in OKC as the Thunder yeah just keep in mind those doors open at one get there early folks you don't want to be standing outside with everybody else unless you get to get there early you can watch the Thunder warm up as Coby white knocks down much needed three-point shot for the Bulls yeah get there early it is fun too all I love watching the guys warm up I mean that was a big part of what I did when I was a player how about that nice pocket pass that time on that shot is Dort trying to check LaVine LaVine drives leans in off balance didn't get the whistle Dort stood his ground talked about doing officials are doing a good job just letting them play here in this second half and another wide open three set up from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander assist number nine on the night and it punctuates the biggest lead of the night for OKC at 21 points 18 out of 36 from behind the ark Michael it has been the difference in this game as the Thunder particularly here in the second half have absolutely caught fire from deep well they've had the Bulls confused and discombobulated not knowing hey what are you doing that extra extra pass a lot of times folks we call that the hockey assist the pass to the pass passer to the score is the is the ball that's making the play and you're forcing a lot of times that extra you know pass and then boy I tell you it's it's really doing damage right now and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has got nine assists which he only did twice last season when he got nine or more Thunder trip to Chicago what a great City to open up the regular season and I know we've been waiting a really long time for the regular season to start preseason kind of gets you going might you get your engines fired up again but once that regular season starts and you start playing for keeps hey it's like it's like it's like when you're at the movie theater and you're waiting for the previews to stop and the movie finally starts and you can settle in that's right that's like the regular season right and get and get a big old bucket of popcorn for you a bottomless bucket of popcorn that's right you can buy that you can buy that oh pay a little extra money oh what a block by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on Patrick and he's got himself a three and that is a rare they on the bench Chet Holmgren from the outside he wants a three this is in a special night folks you've seen it right here on Valley Sports Oklahoma opening night on the road for the Thunder they are lights out offensively shooting 57% from the field how about that make 51% from three 19 shots made on the night just can't help but point out the quality of the three-point shots that the Thunder have had in the second half because it has just been boundless Shai with a double double 31 points 10 assists Jalen to Jet up top little ball fake on Drummond not going to get the three to drop that time with the Thunder defensively Michael there's another great defensive play by Jalen trying to start the break up ahead L door and he's going to lay up the Thunder defense really settled in in the third quarter okah City that Thunder defense that continued to contest all those Chicago shots as Zach LaVine never got comfortable Demar Derozan shooting under 50% it has been a dominant second half and how about Shai Gilgeous Alexander 31 point points five rebounds 10 assists and and he was all over the offense Michael in that third quarter particularly that late third quarter run that 120 run and all the attention that he was getting and just setting up his teammates for all those wide open threes that's one of the reasons why he's got those 10 assists and you know I'm loving that one that stat all the way to the far right those 10 assists that's pretty special talking about a guy who was fourth in the league in scoring last year scored tonight pretty much right at his average of a season ago at 31 points so with just under 90 seconds left you see Mark dagal going into his bench how about pocoski returning to action after missing so much time with that leg injury last season also in the offseason suffered an injury that kept him out we didn't see him in the preseason after playing Just 34 games last year had that big leg injury on December 27th Trey man Usman Jen Lindy Waters and surrendered the lead momentarily and then never looked back as they cranked it up nice pass underneath Cason Wallace with some hops I know it's too early for him to have his coming out party but I'm telling you one thing it started to look like it because I thought that him coming off the bench knocking down those threes when the Bulls were making their run was a huge part of why that scoreboard looks the way it does thunder put up 124 points on its very first game game of the 2020 23 24 season and you know you don't always get nights like this but you know what you work hard in preseason and you hope it translate over and it certainly has tonight a good starting point to work from as the Thunder will get their first victory of the season and first victory of the season on the road as well yeah that's exactly what Mark dagal said early in the season you kind of declare your Baseline and you continue the process of improvement and that is not going to change for this Oklahoma City Thunder team this young Thunder team that gets a solid opening night performance overall particularly from Shai Gilgeous Alexander in his double double but the Thunder do pick up a quality Road Victory here out of the blocks in what is going to be a very long season but game one out of 82 goes the Thunder way as they take down the Chicago Bulls 24 104 efficient night yeah we just Tred to make the right play every play uh K was big tonight he did so he shot when he was open he made the right plays defensively and offensively um the guys came in and gave good minutes and we we came out with a W thank you so much Shai congrats you're welcome quite a bit different from last year and
