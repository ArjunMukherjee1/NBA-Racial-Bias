 Rockets will have the opening possession of the ball game Houston coming off a win a couple of nights ago against the number one team in the NBA in the west OKC Sengun against sabonis that's going to be a compelling storyline sabonis with the rebound off the game's first Miss by Fred VanVleet who picks up Fox at the other end Jabari Smith interestingly enough will be guarding sabonis out top monk Miss firing on the Deep ball and here comes Jalen green green signing that lucrative offseason contract in July and Sengun knocks down the first shot of the game uper and Sengun averaging just under 19 points a game for the Rockets here's Smith on sabonis sabonis inside got the layup to go in traffic and I like that I like that with Sengun not defending him that he's being aggressive going to The Cup right there and using his ability to handle the ball in traffic green snakes the screen and the Fresno California Native with a handful of people friends and family on hand watching him tonight at Golden one and he's just grown exponentially as a player and I think most of all under e udoka it's been his his discipline as a player that has changed Fox from outside Off the Mark rebounded by Green Green played at G League unite ignite pardon me and lost control box up to Murray muray off the bounce against Smith Kegan standing his ground defensively left nowhere for green to go on that possession here's Fox behind the screen nice hesy on VanVleet sprays it to DeRozan two on the shot clock they got to get busy suppos from deep and rebounded by green and that's one of the things that this Houston defense does well they cover multiple efforts across the floor and they're going to take you down to the end of the do clock shun playing off the elbow very much the Hub and facilitator offensively can score it too this one comes off rebounded by DeRozan and you you talked about the story line between Domantas and Sengun very similar players that is the blueprint for Sengun yes and he's young just 22 years old but such a a key piece of this Rockets team good defense by Keegan Murray got the airball Miss from Dillon Brooks here's VanVleet talk it pass to Sengun good and it comes off to Domantas you're going to see a lot of pick and roll action tonight you're going to have to be able to defend that and have your rotations on point Sabonis doesn't hesitate that one off right out to Fox on the carum and he knocks it down De'Aaron Fox on the board with his first field goal now the question is is that a Miss shot or is that an assist uh hey I like let's give it the assist I'll give the assist I'm I'm very you know friendly with my assist just like the earpiece in the open thank you by the way that's a real teammate for you folks K Christensen with the earpiece assist and Smith's jumper is Off the Mark here comes sabonis Frozen against Jabari Smith inside sabonis from the elbow well that was halfway down and out but a good look nonetheless getting good looks but the king starting cold as well as Houston and green fouled on his four ra to the basket Jalen green will go to the free throw line Dâ€™Aaron Fox good to see him find a little early Rhythm here yeah and it's just a nice little tip from Keegan Murray there off that Miss three from sabonis that lands in the right spot and De'Aaron Fox knocks down the triple just one of the two field goals that the Kings have made here in the first four minutes Fox shooting 34% from downtown on the season Jalen green knocks down the first free throw he's coming off a nine-point game a couple nights ago in that aforementioned win against OKC knocks down both and Houston leading six to five box off the double inside to sabonis Great positioning the court awareness for De'Aaron Fox just to to be able to get that ball there quickly this handle the ball on his dribble but still able to make a nice assist green open from downtown off the mark this Houston team Katie doesn't shoot a high volume or a high percentage of three balls yeah I mean they they shoot 33% from deep as as DeRozan not able to get his midi to fall and the Kings trying to get a little flow offensively some Rhythm I mean they're getting quality looks here early on just not converting at a decent clip and B feels like he had a little food there missed the layup going against a bonus a foul underneath is going to go against the Sacramento Kings that's going to go against sabonis his first and loses the handle there as you see but very quickly notices that there's a mouse in the house Red Man bleed on demontis sabonis down low and what a seal by Domantas there his work getting great position here's Sengun Sengun is going to try and walk down sabonis a sweeping hook lands about a foot short it's out of bounds Sacramento basketball well defended that time Houston started two for three they've missed their last seven field goals in a row now Fox touches paint had two for a quarter had the third one knocked away and here's Dillon Brooks Sengun spins fires got it and just the Cross Match in transition he immediately attacks the basket but that's what Malik is going to do do right here answer back and he does with a nice little scoop shot Mark Jones left delay by Malik monk getting his second consecutive start well it had the desired effect when he started against San Antonio and we've got a wedgy there the ball gets wedged that'll be an official jump ball coming out of the Timeout on the floor but well defended by Keegan Murray big assignment trying to stick Jalen green tonight back after this break thanks for joining us time now for our Chipotle real difference makers Alon chinon has been talked about in a lot of ways like a younger Domantas sabonis he's just 22 years old now when you look at their numbers you be the judge I mean it's very similar across the board obviously domos has the experience on them but their ability levels what they're capable of impacting on the floor very very similar they run this off offense through Sengun just as the Kings do through Domantas but you know obviously Domantas with the experience has has an edge in a lot of the numbers but Sengun one of those young players to keep an eye on one of the ones that I really like to watch spoke with some of the Rockets coaches prior to tip off tonight and they say that em adoka has really learned to trust his young center now in end of game situations as a closer as well as a facilitator and that his weak side defense is amongst the most improved areas of his game well and he's in his fourth season now and and you know a lot of that gaining that trust is just experience being put in those situations Fox from the Baseline goes halfway down and Out Sacramento up by a point not a lot of err on that shot for Fox almost winning in just from the touch alone but just a little bit more legs under that he's getting his jacks up at least he's one of five from the field Sengun looked for green out to VanVleet Huerter and Isaac Jones ready to check into the ball game for Mike Brown Jabari Smith Jr meanwhile laces that corner three he's shooting 36% from Deep on the SE shooting a pretty decent clip kind of above average for a lot of the other guys on the roster we mentioned it earlier this is not a great three-point shoot team we have a whistle and a foul underneath against Houston and it's that pick and roll from the top that opened that shot for Smith Jr you know when Demar DeRozan has to come in and take the roll or Sengun and go into the basket to cover the dribble penetration off the the pick and roll I mean that opens up that three-point shot and you know what every team in the leag does that remember Jabari Smith Jr was taking a pick ahead of Keegan Murray couple of years ago here's DeRozan inside for sabonis working against Steven Adams and couldn't finish over the length here's VanVleet the St down three and he knocks it home red VanVleet is the steady Sage veteran of this group you know when it really started to change for the Rockets was a season ago when Dillon Brooks and VanVleet came to Houston they had a lot of young talent but it was those two veteran players that really kind of rounded things out here's Adams that's going to be a loose ball foul against Steven Adams as he grabs sa bonis on his Chase under five minutes to go here in the opening quarter Steven Adams might be the strongest man in the NBA I mean guys that have played with him have told me just that and amongst the best screen sets yes absolutely and and one of those guys that does the little things is domos is able to get it over the top of Adams down low I mean he's got strength he's not a huge presence in terms of a a shot blocker though at The Rim so domos can can definitely attack that and used the ADM screen but came up short on three here's monk in transition on the chase action sabonis flips the screen monk pulls the Deep ball and laces it Malik monk gives Sacramento a onepoint lead you know you look back at a season ago for this Rockets team they had a terrific start to last year too and really about the Midway point of December as green is able to get all the way inside is when things started to kind of turn the other dire injuries to yes turn the other direction for them so you know you look at it and you talk about the Kings and their struggles recently and their expectations I mean things can change quickly in this league Huerter back rimmed it comes off and quickly to Brooks on the outlet Brooks averaging double figures remember now he was amongst the leading scorers in the Pack 12 folks as a senior so defense isn't his only trick oh no man he is confident in his his offense let me tell you of course the Pack 12 doesn't exist anymore I just realized that you know what I'm saying everybody I mean back in my day was the pack 10 so we all cat to the drift back in my day it was a pack eight ktie 1716 let's stop right there really starting to regressing Jalen green with another deep three and a timeout called by Sacramento green is off to a good start offensively three of five leading the way to you by Kaiser Permanente um let's go back to a couple days ago Sunday in the loss to the Spurs the Kings allowed 23 triples a season high and this has been something that has kind of be been a trend early on in the first quarter of this season and when you look at the numbers the Kings allow the second most field goals made at just over 15 uh the third most attempts in the league just under 40 and then 38% for their opponents Beyond The Arc is also the third highest in the league and you know I I kind of feel like this is something that you know you look to a season ago where the Kings their defense was like a Civ they allowed dribble penetration and drives and it it was a problem they're so much better at that this season but what has has been the struggle early in the year is trying to manage also defending the three-point line at a high high rate and they just have not been able to do it with consistency Murray with the snap Drive floater comes up a little bit short Keegan Murray with his first field goal attempt right there with under three minutes to go in the first quarter Kevin Huerter task with trying to stick jayen green goes under the screen got hit by Adams on the next one and doing a great job managing multiple screens in succession red reads it on to prit VanVleet he snatches it back and knocks down the 15-footer that was a really nice defensive segment regardless of the fact that VanVleet made that shot that was a difficult jumper to knock down strong contest with the help from Keegan Murray used in the midst of a 9-2 run Jae Crowder in the ball game as well for Sacramento right now they run their split action and you can see the impact of Houston's defense and just how the kings are struggling to make a pass within the offense they really deny the ball well they deny it well they control the the screens well so that you're not really able to ever get clean action here's Jalen green he's got the hot hand so far this one comes off the Iron Out of Bounds Eason kept it in play and here's Crowder now for three Huerter boy isn't that a sight for sore eyes Kevin Huerter drills the three nice anticipation to be able to steal that ball as Houston was trying to save it from going out of bounds and then just how clean was that look for him smooth quick release herur trying to stick with green VanVleet hit a shot from there against OKC late in the game to help put it away and hits another one there here tonight six-point lead for Houston VanVleet was an undrafted free agent back in the day Huerter this three ball comes off and with a minute to go Sacramento down by six nice job good defense by Darren Fox then bed out top gets into the ball pocket pass to Adams sprays it out to Eason Baseline three Adams pursues it gets it blocked by Isaac Jones put him in the friend zone much of the dismay and disbelief of Adams who looks at Jones says I can't believe you got that yeah quick quick UPS right there by him to be able to elevate and contest and to do it vertically nice job there by Isaac Jones and I'm telling you VanVleet or VanVleet excuse me um Steven Adams we were talking earlier about how strong he is I'm telling you Isaac Jones is a special physical player and he's still very young in gaining experience all out of bounds here was the aftermath of that block shop Adams looks at Isaac Jones says hey that's a hell of a block young man I like it little respect Adams was not healthy all of last year pretty much yeah I mean struggled with with injuries and had surgery lost the ball and Drew the foul right there looks like he got hit in the face St Adams will go to the free throw line for a couple of shots he comes in to give relief to Sengun and really solid veteran from a very athletic family hey Junior Kings is the ultimate youth basketball program for kids ages 6 to 14 whether your child is just starting out or looking to sharpen their skills Junior Kings clinics are the perfect opportunity check out upcoming clinics at kings.com Junior Kings Adams sister Valerie Adams is a former Olympic gold medalist and Olympic uh uh World Championship shot putter so when I saw step a little bit earlier and said are you you're not really the best athlete in the family he said yeah I'd have to agree with you on there yeah listen though he's one of of my favorite alltime NBA players and it's crazy as you see the the Collision there and two guys falling to the ground and Houston able to to squeeze out a bucket from that very discombobulated possession but I've always appreciated the work ethic of Steven Adams and the little things that he does those are the things that give you a long career and are so impactful to a team but not the things that usually get your your Praises sung really loudly Fox knocks it down with 5.5 to go in the quarter he Corrals VanVleet at midcourt he draws iron but it's off the mark De'Aaron Fox two of six for Five Points in that first quarter Sacramento down by seven an uncharacteristic low-scoring period for them give is presented by Macy's as we welcome you back to Golden One Center Sacramento Kings down by seven as we get started here in the next 12 minutes in stark contrast cated a couple of nights ago against San Antonio when Sacramento scored 42 points in that opening quarter Malik Monk's first start as a member of the Sacramento Kings the Kings will come out with De'Aaron fox in the back court Isaac Jones on the floor as well Jae Crowder up front as well the 42 to 21 differential there when you're looking at last or Sunday's game versus tonight's in first quarter points has so much to do with the uh defensive capabilities of the opponent let's just say that Eason is tasked with guarding Fox Murray with a nice jump hook you love the way he was very decisive there Katie yeah and puts it on the floor takes the contact and and more importantly it's the finishing through the contact his jumper he had earlier was a little bit short just got to get legs under it and take that contact and and follow through then Thompson the side of the glass out of bounds it'll come back nice imperious move here by Keegan Murray the anticipation as the defender is closing out to him and he takes it to the middle and gets deep into that paint for the floater Fox working against e good screen by Isaac Jones Huerter shakes out of the corner got Reed Sheppard in the air draws the foul and we'll go to the free throw line for a couple of free throws as Sheppard gets his is welcome to the NBA moment right there from Kevin Huerter yeah a lot of times rookies those are the ones you can get at least one of those a game from Huerter at the free throw line been an uneven season for him shooting just 62% from the stripe and now a quick word from the California community colleges I can take a smart path to a bachelor's degree save my by starting at a California Community College and transferring to a guaranteed safe spot at a 4-year University learn about the associate degree for transfer and enroll today at I canot tool.com Kevin rolled his ankle in Portland in early in the second quarter and this is his first game playing since but you know he's been recently moved into that second unit and part of me really wonders if that is going to relieve a little bit of that pressure offensively and we're going to see his offensive Arsenal open up a little bit we're going to have to replace some of the bench punch that Malik monk brought to the bench he mayoka not happy about what transpired at the offensive in a moment ago having a spirited discussion with Sengun yeah and how about that I mean you're talking to your Center about how he needs to control that offense better your star player everyone's eligible to get put on blast we talk about udoka here's Fox against the rookie HS Off the Mark and coming back the other way good defense by Sheppard here's Jabari Smith Jr R their elbow splits Eason spins lost control got it back off glass just the way I guess he threw it up K Eason on the board for the Rockets the Kings did a great job defensively until it became a 50/50 ball situation and it was the effort of Houston boy great move by Huerter left it short here's Thompson Eason off the jab step and that's going to be a goal against Isaac Jones the lead back up to seven and very very close but he's just showing as you know he's kind of getting his minutes opened up in games what he's capable of but a lot of that timing and stuff on shot blocking is is just kind of getting extended minutes nice move inside off the feed from Fox and Jones is going to go to the free throw line good find by Fox sending Isaac Jones to the strip just five of nine on the season Jarren fox saying that he was fouled on the previous field goal attempt that one that he missed from the free throw line Jones at the foul line for Sacramento had a season High 12 points against San Antonio a couple of nights ago knocks down the first rookie out of Washington State undrafted in this past season's draft signed a two-way contract with the Kings back in early July and has really been one of the bright stories for Sacramento this year Well when Mike Brown talked about him early early in the preseason and and had mentioned you know kind of how much he liked him and liked his play but he was deep deep on his bench and injuries have opened up the opportunity and now you see why Mike is a big fan Smith from the perimeter knocks it home Smith with his second three ball Houston shooting four of 12 from downtown Sheppard fell the Love Jones set it with his chest the force that he put that down with and the timing of that play the really beautiful pass by Kevin Huerter switched on to Thompson Sengun inside good hands by Huerter knocked it away Sengun got it backed and laid it home and see that's the thing we've seen it multiple times where the Kings kind of deflect the ball and it's the 50/50 ball and and Houston coming up with it and that's one of their strengths as a unit it's just the Relentless effort that they give even when plays are broken box from Deep Mur kept it alive another possession Crowder Cross Court to Huerter 10 on the shot clock for Sacramento Fox Huerter from deep and knocks down another one Kevin Huerter showing big signs of life and being resuscitated he's two of four from Deep didn't even touch iron on that last shot nor on is first but look at the play previously where he connected with Isaac Jones just a nicely time pass for our SMUD clean power cam look at the game and there's that triple just laces it Kevin Huerter is quick to say it's all about feel and Rhythm for me when it comes to my three ball in a good way so far off the handoff from monk back out top to Malle sabonis inside wonderful pristine perfect ball Movement by Sacramento to make it a three-point game and the Kings kind of giving the Rockets a taste of their own medicine on the defensive end making them have to defend that high screen action big rebound by sabonis and the push to monk got the rookie on him back to Malik straightaway three ball left it a little bit short Chen good deep Outlet to Reed Sheppard good contest but a slick finish by the rookie out of Kentucky his father Jeff played Collegiate basketball for the wild cats back in the day as did Mom for the women's team empty corner pick and roll and De'Aaron with a straight line drive left it short here's amen Thompson Thompson Twins talented basketball players brother with the Pistons who've been a great story so far in the early part of the season and Sheppard makes his way all the way to the basket with the left and the lead is back up to seven for the Rockets time on on the floor we're going to pay some bills and come right back Sacramento Kings down by seven here in the second quarter time now for our fourth play of the day the Houston Rockets hang their hat their identity lies in their impregnable defense most of the time look at those Stellar numbers across the board points allowed field goal percentage defensively three-point defense opponent assists defensive rating and net rating as a consequence of all that and talking to Brooks prior to tip tonight he said that they've really even more than last year taken another step at the defensive end and bought into eme adoka system and he says Mark if we don't we sit it's pretty simple yeah no it's it's very simple and you know eeme is one of those guys that kind of subscribes to the the Jerry Sloan Mantra right they can't call them all so go out there and be physical make the officials have to adjust to your style instead of the other way around and if it doesn't doesn't work out then they can back off a little bit but it it generally works and that's why you see those great defensive numbers because they're a physical hard-nosed team to play against Jun out top 10 on the shot clock Eason inside knocked away but a foul going to be called against Kevin Huerter sending Tari East into the free throw line for a couple of shots Kevin Huerter getting a lot of lot of miles in on the defensive end he's ended up being run off of a bunch of screens here early in this game and chasing Cutters and all the

and much more learn more about how you can celebrate with your family work or organization today at kings.com SLG groups e has been struggling a bit of late offensively over the last four games just at game but making up for it at the defensive end got the steal I mean we're going to have a whistle and a foul going against Demar DeRozan misses the free throw is able to hustle after it come up with the ball gets the shot not able to finish there and ends up being a bad way for the Kings as as Demar DeRozan gets called for the foul and that is 100% just hustle Mark that's it there was no foul called on the play K just side out of bounds meanwhile that was the first King's turnover of the game a moment ago when DeRozan lost the ball Sengun with a quick spin Brooks wide open an uncontested three Sacramento catches a reprieve there and fox brings it across into the corner DeRozan aonis with a nice extra pass and layup oh the assist starting to stack up for Sacramento they've got nine now nearly at the halfway point of what this Houston defense allows we just talked about that a moment ago and one of Mike Brown's Keys tonight is he really wanted them to try and push the pace in transition and that's where they're going to come up with a lot of their assists meanwhile K we have a foul called against Demar DeRozan that's going to be his first personal foul second team foul meanwhile good ball movement here at the other end and it makes its way from one side of the floor to the other dribble penetration on the Baseline nice Cut there by Damon sabonis for the Finish jayen green back into the ball game for the Rockets here's VanVleet against Murray and be play is with his food and draws the foul on Keegan Murray you and that's as frustrated as you see Keegan Murray get and he hides it very well um great job leading with his his chest right there moving his feet but if you saw it from our angle there was a little bit of a hook where V baited him in to that foul a little bit and Hey listen I'll take the foul because Keegan being physical and up there defending I like him in those situations and B with the Nash dribble out to Jalen green that three a little bit strong off the M fox quickly to D Roa with the hit ahead monk running the Lane Fox back out to Murray got to have this three rattles halfway down and out that's been the early story of his season so far had a good look at it Brooks one more to VanVleet Smith slips out on the screen and rebounded by Sacramento great box out by both Malik Monk and Keegan Murray right there whistle under and a foul will go against Dillon Brooks and interestingly enough sabonis was getting up off the court I'm guessing the two were connected somehow yeah take a look from our SMUD clean power cam that's going to give us the angle yeah and it was on Smith Jr I I said Brooks out have just happen well Hey listen I mean you you toss him up in the air it's a 50/50 chance Dillon's my guy but yeah under five minutes to go Houston team very physical you feel them at the defensive end Fox throws it into the mid post sabonis working against the shorter Brooks has two hands on and last time I checked when uh when an offensive player faces up you're not allowed to put two hands on them and that's what tillan Brooks did right in front of the official take a look right here and it took him a second to call it he did it a couple times before the official called it right in front of John Goble that's the fourth team foul against Houston they go right back to sabonis against Brooks got to his strong hand and he put Brooks in the weight room it was a shoulder day today for Domantas Dillon Brooks is 6' s and he is one heck of a Defender but I'm sorry that is that is not a a prime match up for you green with the three it and a foul is going to go against Sacramento he's calling against De'Aaron and fox but I think they're going to take a look at this they're signaling Mar Kut the one of the three officials signaling to review this to see if it was released prior to the whistle or not they called the foul on Fox and Smith and fox having words this is what I said in the pregame at some point there would be words between or some kind of expression of competitiveness between the two teams yes absolutely and knew was coming there's one on Dillon Brooks he just got a technical and now the Kings have a technical on De'Aaron Fox I believe the game just started folks we were waiting this was inevitable Dillon Brooks was chirping at Malik monk earlier but Malik is of the mind that he'll chirp back but he's never going to get baited into this but I think it was Jamar Jun that started this technical vows against each team here's another look at the sequence Fox had his arm around Smith and that's where the foul was called by Mar kogut the official out top it looks to me and he's saying it's a flop and then Dillon Brooks takes his finger obviously okay we've seen it's going to escalate the situation we've seen this movie before as Smith chimes in as well De'Aaron and fox is not to be played with right now but here's the thing the point De'Aaron and fox is trying to make is that he flopped and that was a moving screen and De'Aaron started falling backwards and grabbed onto him to try and prevent himself to kind of from falling to the floor all the way I'm going to predict something right here Katie we've seen this movie before with De'Aaron Fox he's got five we've he's got five points right now he will finish in double figures before the the end of the half mark it down there's the foul on Fox and they're at the monitor looking to see if there was if the shot came prior to the whistle technical fouls meanwhile called against Dillon Brooks and Malik mon got the Sacramento technical fouls you could have given it to pretty much anybody I like it but Fox was pointing his index finger at both Brooks and Jabari Smith there's a lot to iron out here in this replay it's like that old Tupac song De'Aaron saying I ain't no killer but don't press me don't push me don't push me like I said this was inevitable this was a pre-ordained moment as De'Aaron said that was a foul and as VanVleet stepped in Jabari Smith entered the breakers and they're still trying to adjudicate this at the monitor Dillon Brooks was looking for it though and we talked about it in the sense that this Houston team wants this type of angst and you know kind of guys going at each other it feeds into their physicality into their style because when it gets chippy when it gets physical the officials aren't going to call every play it does it does help them they don't do cigarettes but they want all the smoke Houston is just like that seven-point lead for the Rockets as John Goble and aric kit still trying to decipher what happened in that last sequence and this is taking an inordinate amount of time as we finally get the decision there was definitely a lot that they had to to comb through there to get this right multifaceted for sure after review the legal contact occurs prior to the upward shooting motion therefore the basket will not count so it won't count additionally there were three technical fil assessed during the dead ball one on De'Aaron Fox One on Jabari Smith and one on Dillon books therefore Sacramento will shoot one free throw and then Houston willb the ball so the difference being the extra technical yeah did we did not catch the one on Jabari Smith Jr so therefore two of them cancel each other out and the Kings will have a free throw here hope you're able to take inventory with us there folks 4238 the players are still confused so hopefully you're following it a little bit better than them KN if you watch the Houston Rockets T this is a team that plants its heels in the p and does not get ground and this was going to happen that's the image of their head coach e adoka 20 games in you know 20 this is game 22 for for them Dillon Brooks has already got six technicals so yeah that that tells you so the technical foul was onik not Fox they just cleared that up but De'Aaron is still talking mad he's still talking to the officials he may as well have given him one here's gavar Smith Jr dho to Thompson Brooks for three said he was to score in the Pack 12 in Oregon folks No Sleep lead up to six the uh the crowd spent the entire review booing Dillon Brooks every time he came on the screen so he also is motivated now M those post to sabonis double team coming from Brooks got a whistle and a foul will go against sabonis who like he swung the ball at Brooks here let's take another look oh he used his off arm that's going to be his second personal foul he cleared out that is uh not the type of reaction for the impact but we'll take it good defense by Monk took it away Murray raising up and got it blocked by Jabari Smith it will stay Sacramento Kings basketball with about three and a half minutes to go in the first half Kings getting out M transition but it was Keegan kind of bringing it away that opened up that space for Smith Jr to go for that block sabonis with a height advantage on green they switch it we have a traveling violation sabonis on the last couple of touches Katie has looked a little offbeat two turnovers one was a call that I feel like Dillon Brook sold but you got to give him credit for it that one right there I think dilos is reading the room at the moment and knowing that that Dillon is probably going to try and flop on that for a charge as well and bleed off class miraculous shot by vanle tuck bucket and the lead is up to eight vanle remember has an NBA championship and like I said Darren Fox doing a little light work there from the elbow makes it 47 to 41 Fox with seven points monk got hit with that Smith screen green oh and a potential four-point play Jalen green with his second three ball he's up to 12 and we have a timeout called by Houston that was a bone jarring screen got just enough a month to give green some room Fresno California's favorite sun right in shap Family Fitness to give one lucky fan the chance to win four lower level tickets with lounge access to see the Kings take on the Lakers a private key round on the Kings Court and epic Fitness prizes including a 12-month membership in and out kings.com win for your shot at this incredible Prize Package and a boisterous luciferous crowd on hand here tonight in Sacramento the Kings down by nine with under three minutes to go here in the opening half Jalen green going to the free throw line he's four of eight from the field two of five from deep and playing a very efficient floor game at the offensive end for eeme adoka and udoka has made no qualms about if Jalen isn't playing the right way about sitting him down and oh yeah that's why this team is on an upward surge right now accountability I talked about it earlier the difference in terms of Jalen green you know kind of free eeme Oka to now is just he's a much more disciplined offensive player sabonis inside that time didn't struggle to get a shot after turning it over over the previous two sequences El is back down to eight the danger of your dbos if you have Dillon Brooks on you and you're in the in the pain in the low block is is his ability to try and draw a charge cuz he's smaller and he's quick and so that I think that's where the travel came was the hesitation box got a hand up VanVleet with the air B outs a green shot clock down to four you don't want a foul here he doesn't realize that green launches wow somebody's been going to church every Sunday the lead is up to 11 sometimes playing in front of your your family is all the motivation that you need and he's had himself a really good first half that'll do it monk back to Fox steps into the three ball De'Aaron Fox and if you're De'Aaron Fox sometimes someone getting in your face is all the motivation you need there you have it yep told you he'd be in double figure scoring by the end of the half after that minor altercation Fox looking for a call on the illegal and he got it right there he had been having a constant conversation with Jonathan Sterling that's what they do I mean they're a very physical team and that's not just on the defensive end it's also on the offensive end but how about the hell Mary from Jalen green knocks it down De'Aaron fox answers back with a triple on the other side and there's a lot of action on those screens and De'Aaron finally getting the officials to Blow That Whistle call the violation oh boy sabonis wasn't expecting the pass pass on the chase action and they turn it over that's just their fourth turnover of the ball game and all of them coming here in this second quarter but a couple of those were travel and then an offensive foul that foul is going to go against sabonis his third personal foul and that's going to put Houston back at the free throw line with 126 to go here wonder if Mike Brown elects to keep him in the ball game or not don't want him getting that forth well meanwhile Sengun has been on the bench for what seems like a really long time and he's played 13 minutes in this game but he has zero fouls Kevin Huerter will come into the ball game for sabonis yeah you don't want to risk number four right now so Sacramento a downsize Katie basically Keegan Murray is playing at center right now and Kevin hder or I don't know is it De'Aaron that's the four I don't know take your pick I don't think it really matters it's small lineup out on the floor for this rocket spot and that five out offense that the Kings like to run bunch of interchangeable pieces here's fox out top against amen Thompson green switches onto him Fox spins and pulls Ken's got 12 hey they got on his last nerve and he's making them feel it now box up to 12 and he is smiling he is enjoying the healthy competition green good block by Monk got it from behind Thompson lost the handle it'll be Sacramento basketball 52 seconds to go both De'Aaron Fox and Malik monk did a great job contesting that last shot but let's take a look back at the nice turnaround jumper that foxy just knocked down on the offensive end and they're going to go right back to it got Brooks on the switch the high arching three but yeah count him up he's got three of them you call and it is so true we've seen it so many times you go ahead and you irritate him get under his skin and he comes back like fire oh the Aon fox trying to strap up Fred VanVleet oh he took his cornbread and told him about it then he asked him for his better I'll take that too there's about a 1 second difference between the shot and game clock they can run it down if they choose skip pass to the corner Murray on the drive back to DeRozan back to Murray the three got it what's his name a late rally to cap the end of the first half by Sacramento De'Aaron Fox catalyzed it with a couple of steals a three ball and a nice midi to add a little touch Aon Fox got hit and then he hit back by hurting Houston's feelings good defense at the other end Fox playing so good make you want to slap your mama sometimes the Rockets margin to just one point as we bring you The Lazy Boy broadcast wo Mark Jones court side along with ktie Christensen this game with a suddenly a playoff top type of vibe and when you look at the end part of that second quarter Katie the Kings found their offense through Darren Fox and Houston tried him just a little bit maybe not a good move yeah know they they legitimately pissed him off let's let's take a look at his bucket chart first to to start out with and you're going to see where he's done a lot of his damage but that is what instigated the whole thing the point the finger in the face and then De'Aaron rattles off a 10o second quarter he's got three rebounds three assists and three steals some key steals coming late in that second quarter that really got that offense ignited for Sacramento and that's the big one right there look at his Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket chart right here and he's six to 12 from the field you see the area where he is doing all of his his damage and he was just brilliant there late in that second quarter sure was our bucket chart brought to you by your hometown KFC underway here in the third quarter Murray out top looking inside to D roen has a mismatch on VanVleet foul bucket and one and that's what you kind of want to see because DeMar rosen had just three points in the first half one of five from the field and I like seeing that coming out at halftime Mike Brown draws up a play for Demar DeRozan just to see if they can't get him one quickly to maybe get him into a little bit of Rhythm I'm surprised not a lot of people know about slap y Mama seasoning you've never heard that uh of course I have oh yeah a lot of people I also fry my turkey so do we need to go down this well when I said De'Aaron make you want to slap your mama you know y I know all about it good De'Aaron with active hands defensively TI that out of bounds Sacramento with a two point lead it has been a uphill climb for most of the evening here jenon matched up against the bonus monk really into the ball handler VanVleet they Corral him on the Baseline one more green was on a heater early and he stays hot to start the third quarter my goodness he has really been all of the offense for this Houston Rockets team he's got 19 now the only one in double figur scor Bing signed a lucrative three-year contract 2 plus one in the off SE and sabonis expressing himself at the rim and did you see the narrow angle that Malik monk had to fit that ball through that was just an Exquisite play between Monk and Domantas sabonis great point ktie he has six assists already and that's going to be an offensive fou against Sengun look at this pass that is a pass had to be perfectly timed the cut was great the Cutters going along as you see in our SMUD clean power cam he had the Red Sea parted for him so he had a clean Lane to the rim here's monk working against Green DeRozan off the pin down a two to two and the jumper got him and one two for two to start the third quarter and going to the fre free throw line on both possessions all five of the kings first half free throw attempts came in that second quarter and it's started with the technical fouls and all the stuff that went down but we know that that is a big big piece of Demar D Roan's offensive p uh pile there is getting to the free throw line missed the foul shot three-point lead for the Kings VanVleet brings it across green off the PIN out to Brooks from deep and Dillon Brooks makes another three-pointer his second one of the night he's got eight points to go along with three rebounds not a heavy volume of of offensive looks for him tonight just five field goal attempts they're going at him defensively and it bowels to Rosen they ran that same cross screen action to get De'Aaron the ball on the Block Katie every play what do you make of what Mike Brown is doing right now with Demar three of the four plays that they have run have gone to Demar DeRozan and I mentioned it that he had a very inactive first half and so for Mike to really try and get him going early knows he's going to need him in this game anticipates it being close because of the way this Houston Rocket team defends mon High AR and three is W Sacramento back up by three his music by far my fav Fox fighting around the screen sabonis Coral the ball handler and they get the steal with active hands sabonis leading the break off the turnover monk pocket pass to sabonis one more the spray to Murray got it time out Rockets everything that the kings are doing offensively now is getting this Rockets defense on their heels and look at Domantas sabonis so proud of Keegan Murray knocking down his second triple in this game Malik is out there making buckets making passes Keegan Murray getting himself going offensively and the Kings on a little bit of a roll here in the third game and let's go back to the second quarter first you're going to see that plop by Dillon Brooks and then this happened and it's escalated from that moment on and Daren fox looks straight at Dillon Brooks and says that was a flop and Dillon Brooks gets a technical De'Aaron Fox and Jabari Smith Jr get into it Malik monck ends up getting a technical and this was all about four minutes left in the second quarter and from that moment on not only has there been a fire under De'Aaron foxes behind but the kings are playing much much better very aggressive on both ends by six here's BL ble Sengun at the elbow Stars down sabonis couple of jab steps and misses the midi De'Aaron with a rebound L with 15 points for boards monk against Green throws it off the screen man he is in a smooth Rhythm right now he was one of five in the first half of this game he is now four of eight just reached double figures and another moving screen on Sengun and that has so much to do with how De'Aaron Fox and Malik Monk and the perimeter players for Sacramento Kings are fighting over the screen action right now and it really baits those big guys into adjusting that hip a little bit putting out the requisite energy tonight at the defensive end of the floor try to get it to to rozen again monk goes instead to sabonis for the layup great decision making and discernment by Malik monk who now has eight assists in this game Sacramento surging ahead by 10 ble getting his second start tonight and we're seeing how their offense is adjusting with him spending more time alongside Darren Fox and Domantas sabonis he is playmaking more whistle and a contact inside Sengun fouled by disbelieving De'Aaron D Ro hey nice hard one though if you're going to foul if it's going to go that way you make it difficult make them feel you physically he came away with the basketball yeah he he's thinking he had a jump ball situation there but I we could not tell from our position on the floor court side kind of where dear's argument is on that play but Sengun kind of shooking up a little bit time now for our wing stop bringing the flavor and here are your NBA triple double leaders so far this season a familiar list LeBron with six at 40 years old pretty much turns 40 in a couple of weeks sa bonis with four Kate Cunningham part of a much improved piston team this year who up until tonight was a perfect 3 and0 in the Emirates NBA cup action well and if you look back to a season ago sabonis led the league in triple doubles and double doubles he had 26 triple doubles a year ago and it kind of goes to show like things have shifted and I think we'll continue to shift I just mentioned a moment ago that with Malik monk in the starting lineup we're seeing him handle the ball a little bit more playmaking wise than than doos and with the addition of Demar DeRozan less time with the ball in Dom's hand as well so you got to wonder if the triple double n numbers might come down a little bit the bonus with slick handle Murray made the last one that's two in a row let me hear that sweet song well that is his third triple so that is three in a row for him actually he's three of four from downtown missed his first this could be a Breakout game for Keegan returning to that 41% 3point percentage from his rookie season well this is a team he has been comfortable with in his career playing against and one of his four 30-point games came against this Rockets team inside sabonis with the dump hook good was looking for the foul call the lead is up to 12 biggest of the ball game for Sacramento what a third quarter they've had you look at the Rockets they led by 11 in the first half DeRozan got a piece of the ball out of bounds and keep in mind he already has W technical so the demonstrative reaction to the no call right there he could get in TR that was all ball nice hands there by Demar DeRozan VanVleet to Sengun Murray with nice help Brooks with the show and go lost it that's going to be an offensive foul against Dillon Brooks his fourth personal foul and udoka summons Thompson off of his bench to replace him and I think that the Kings got the memo when they saw De'Aaron Fox get in Dillon Brook's face and step up to him you saw Dillon have a really strong reaction he came out knocked down a couple shots too but they know that if they're all on the same page they can really get under Dillon Brook's skin and it can work against the Rockets Sacramento up by 12 the Rosen has really come alive here in this third quarter and he draws the foul on Jalen green that's going to be the penalty situation DeRozan will go to the free throw line and the Kings have come alive here with a Timeout on the court deamar DeRozan leading the way here in the second half so far we'll be back right after this break basketball on NBC Sports California is brought to you by m Macy's season to give presented by Macy's King's trying to build on their largest lead of the game theyve got a 12-point advantage over the visiting Houston Rockets right now in the third quarter has been good to Demar DeRozan right out of the gate three of the first four possessions were plays for Demar and he converted on all of them knocking down jumpers but also getting to the free throw line my favorite though is that he is playing at both ends of the floor here in the second half he's drawn a charge nice deflection on Dillon Brooks and that that charge he drew sent Dillon Brooks to the bench because of his foul trouble so yes his impact has been great monk misses the layup out of the timeout here Smith Jr Houston didn't have numbers Smith pulls anyway out of bounds it'll be Sacramento basketball kings up by 12 as we approach the Midway point of this third quarter here's fox DeRozan got to his spot man he's on a wave like a doag right now smooth and I feel like De'Aaron is calling this action right now cuz he turned down the high pick and roll action sent domos to set a pin down for De'Aaron and he is really featuring and highlighting him here offensively in the third quarter got to love it beating the hot hand green Sengun on the short roll great Up and Under move and one as Sengun will go to the free throw line for the three-point play attempt and I think it's something that it we need to point out Mike Brown talks a lot about how he doesn't call plays he gives them the freedom to call plays on the floor to recognize what is going on in the game who has the hot hand in this instance right now it's De'Aaron DeRozan and De'Aaron out there making decisions to continue feeding that that just is the selfless nature of this king's offense not to mention the fact that Amen Thompson is one of the top on ball defenders in the league if you ask coaches and ask about him crazy and DeRozan just made that look real easy just his second year in the league but listen Tamar DeRozan is is no uh rookie here he's seen a lot box off glass got it back missed the second one had a couple of good cracks at it Le leaders 11 for Sacramento Thompson Cross cour VanVleet with the catch and shoot three comes off really strong contest by Domantas sabonis but that leaves Sengun down on the offensive glass and they're not able to keep him off the boards that is an advantage that has been in strong in Houston's favor all night is rebounding the r Ro are going to try and post up VanVleet off the turnaround Demar DeRozan hotter than Fish Grease right right now he has really picked up the pace in the third quarter big time he's got nine points here and there's still 5 minutes to go in the third little Flash and post up by Sengun trying to draw the call didn't but scored the bucket anyway I think if there's one thing about his game that is a little bit indicative of sometimes you see foreign players a little bit more of the the trouble with physicality um the the atrics are are something he could work on here's the cross screen they run cross punch for DeRozan and he'll go right back to the free throw line getting the foul on Thompson and Thompson looking to the bench to emay udoka saying what am I supposed to do I've tried everything on Demar DeRozan but this was the previous possession and freshman bleet stuck on an island with Demar DeRozan and there is the foul and you can see why they call it because he wasn't able to fully follow through with that shooting motion Houston unable to adapt to that play that they're running for DeRozan who's really gotten loose here in the third Infinity folks gives fans the fastest connection to the Kings stream the biggest moments from the best seat in the house xinity bring on the good stuff and Sacramento able to get him you talk about the action they're getting him on that left Baseline low block and the right elbow and those are the areas where they're picking and choosing based on screen setting which way they want him to come off got that previous one over VanVleet his former teammate in Toronto with the Raptors Rosen has 16 to the game 13 of them coming here in the third Thompson raises up and draws the foul on sabonis and for Domantas that's going to be his fourth personal foul second team foul against Sacramento dmen Thompson will go to the free throw line for the Houston Rockets Thompson a 72% free throw shooter at all bench scores with nine points for Houston in the previous game as Keegan Murray comes back into the ball game and we've seen Keegan kind of open up a little bit offensively he's got 11 points and the welcome news about it is three of his four field goals have come from downtown Thompson missed the second one got it rebound but couldn't convert Kings off in running Isaac Jones running the lane Malik with a side step three it'll be sacrament of ball well the fans on the sideline are in sensed right right now they feel like that was touched by Houston hean Murray will trigger yeah and they were right looks like we're going to get a challenge here by E Oka they have challenged the call on the floor we're going to take a step aside folks and come back in just a minute me 8271 Sacramento surging ahead here in the third quarter this coach's challenge is presented by Sprite and the call on the floor was Sacramento basketball and that had e adoka calling a timeout and challenging the call on the floor definitely hard from that angle but all week is see was the fan reaction you could see how they started pointing their fingers a couple of them jumped up pretty positive that it had touched them and that's that's the best angle you got right there it's going to be a tough tough thing to determine not easy but the call on the floor is King's ball correct so there must be indisputable evidence exactly so I don't know that there is indisputable evidence still taking a look and I don't I mean even as they're showing it zoomed in on the Jumbotron I cannot tell if he actually did touch it or not so I think it will likely stay King's ball just for lack of sufficient evidence to overturn John goo there still at the monitor but in the big picture of this third quarter Sacramento has played its best basketball its best what 7 and 1/2 minutes so far and behind Demar DeRozan who has 13 points the quarter 13 out of his 16 LED Sacramento after review the call stands they remain Sacramento basketball the chall is unsuccessful shot clock will reset to 14 and I think a lot of that is just because it was really tough in terms of suff evidence to overturn so that worked out well for Sacramento Sacramento really has the ball popping right now 21 assists on 32 field goals the Rockets allow that many assists per game and Sacramento already has Reed that total of 21 and outscoring this Rockets team in the second half 28-6 4 minutes to go and Demar DeRozan who just missed that jumper has been absolutely Sensational here in the third quarter Murray couldn't get the offensive rebound it'll come back the other way Eason brings it across then bleed off the Adams screen second side action with green and there's going to be a timeout called by eeme udoka with the Houston Rockets down by 11 and 352 to go in the third quarter of the game we've teamed up with local brand bunny years to bring you 10 exclusive te's throughout the season season our second drop in the collection is tonight grab your Untamed tea for just $30 visit kings. team store.com grab yours tonight visit teamteam store.com and get yours tonight 340 to go in the third monk brings it across small lineup out on the floor you've got Isaac Jones at the center Huerter straight away three Murray with another offensive rebound that's become one of the stronger parts of his floor game right now great skip pass to the corner monk drives the close out back to Jones couple fakes on Adams Big Time move gets it to go Isaac Jones 10 minutes off the bench and he's got six points for Mike Brown Mike playing a very short rotation tonight yeah basically seven and a half player yeah I mean at this at this juncture Keon Ellis who's been playing big minutes has not touched the floor toones running the Flor punching it home he is shockingly athletic I mean and it's deceptive in so many ways I did not think that he was going to have the spring in his step running the floor like that catching that ball to be able to elevate and dunk I think it caught Steven Adams off guard as well Jalen green laces a deep three making a 12-point game two and half minutes to go in the third just have to hope that they can close out this quarter strong these last two minutes plus mon turned the corner inside tough catch for Jones heavy traffic it'll stay Sacramento basketball but look at the activity of Isaac Jones here and we've talked about it so much he just does a great job in limited short burst of minutes of coming in and making his presence felt he does not shy away from opportunities on the offensive end gets out rewarded for the rim run right there out runs Steven Adams and good kick ahead could be another great find by Hony McNair the team's general manager Fox finds himself open that's his first bucket of the second half he's up to 18 on a very efficient night s of 15 shooting and he hasn't looked for his shot because what he did is he got his running mate Demar DeRozan ready and primed for a fourth quarter run Jalen green draws the foul on Fox fox has been very vocal tonight and I love to see it Katie in his directing his teammates and directing traffic especially at the defensive end here he does it on offense and a nice drive and kick from Keegan Murray here Fox looking for his shot and there you have a nice bucket there by jayen Green he had 16 points in the first half but he has just started to kind of get a little action offensively here late in the the quarter that's going to be an offensive foul against Isaac Jones looked like he clipped VanVleet who's still down on the court I looked away from the action yeah that's a wondering if Mike Brown is going to try and challenge that or not and bleach slow to get up it looked like he did throw that hip out a little bit but then he tried to bring it back in recognizing but it was too late at that point and when you've got a defense like the rockets that really tries to fight over things it's so you have to be so concise with your screens or else you're going to get called for moving Thompson sprays it to the wing Eason missfires rebounded Huerter up to Murray on the bouns KGAN lacerates the lane but lost the handle Eason coming back steps through and draws the foul he'll go to the line for a couple of shots Tari Eason coming off a six-point night against OKC a couple of nights ago the foul will go against Jae Crowder that's going to be his pardon me Huerter they're calling his third and it's so loud in here mark that I didn't even hear the whistle on that me either I just saw that everyone stopped moving it is against Jae cow first answer is always the right one as Eason knocks down the free throw 111 to go here in the third quarter Jae crowder started the first two games appearing in a Sacramento uniform and came off the bench against San Antonio again coming off the bench here tonight and obviously he was signed last Wednesday I believe it was and that was with Demar D rozing this Demar DeRozan missing a couple more games box turn the corner wow what speed can't slow that man down don't let him get ahead of steam they Blitz green Sheppard Cross Court to Sengun one more to Thompson on the reverse partially blocked Eason with the fall just a hardworking team I mean multiple efforts you're going to have to box guys out sometimes their best play is the Miss shot exactly Fox splits the double team finds Huerter matched up against Shang gun had some food and ate heads up move by Kevin Huerter you got a big coming out at you you put it on the deck and you blow by him get all the way to the rim Huerter up to 10 on the night green raising up and draws the foul on crowder and green slow to get up took a shot from Jae Crowder De'Aaron Fox we talked about it earlier in third he really looked to get Demar to Rosen going but now he's looking to himself and Kevin Huerter immediately puts it on the deck when you see a big out nice little finger roll at The Rim but Jae Crowder is going to get called for the foul right there and it it really is just because he had that left arm down if he had gone up both arms vertical he might have gotten away with that one but took a while for Jalen green to get up off the floor Jae Crowder will rattle your feelings yeah some if he bowls you some of that is intentional right like accident on purpose yeah because listen Jalen green took it right in the face that was listen that was 100% sending a message Jalen green has been getting down hill on the king's defense and has scored the last several possessions and that was just a reminder next time you come down remember what just happened and maybe you're going to hesitate a little bit and Jalen green has a little bit of blood so they will tend to him with what we call infection control here in the NBA which postco took a whole another meaning yep Crowder with the foul on that last play and you know it's interesting to watch Sacramento raise their level of physicality in going up against one of the most physical teams in the NBA these Houston Rockets there's green getting tended to by the athletic training staff well like eeme udoka says you know Allah Jerry Sloan you know they can't call everything so sometimes when you're playing against another physical team there's a freedom in that for you because it all also allows you to get a little loose on the defensive end because if it's not part of your identity and you go out in another game you're not going to get the same whistle as when it is against a team that is known for the same type of physicality so green saw his Corner man got stitched up back of the free throw line having a good night 24 points for the young man from Fresno California area code 559 in the house Crowder goes back to the bench for Mike Brown it'll be bunk Fox Huerter Jones and Murray on the floor for Sacramento for these final 16 seconds Thompson a good on ball point of attack defender on Fox off the drag screen by Jones Fox lost the handle turns it over to Eason and they got a two-on one Sheppard with the reverse layup with 2.4 to go monk will launch it'll count got it Malik means king in Arabic and a kingly jumper from how about this heads up play first of all de Fox lost the ball they get a bucket but he comes up shot clock recognition finds Malik monk his running mate and he knocks down the triple back for the fourth quarter here at Golden One Center Sacramento with a 12-point lead as we begin Thompson against Huerter good defense by Huerter to get the stop partially blocked that shot Kevin has done a nice job off of Mike Brown's bench tonight as he Crowder Jones Fox and Murray start the fourth inside Jones with the hammer Isaac Jones making a big time impactful contribution here tonight it doesn't have to be broken to be beautiful right it can be broken to be beautiful I love that the kings are just hustling out there and it may not be perfect but it is about hustling and beating guys to the ball and doing the little things Kevin Huerter that was a broken play that was a pass that was the foot pass yeah absolutely it's a soccer pass or a footy pass I don't know what you're supposed to find got a whistle and one shun came up on the other side of the basket for the reverse know something to keep in mind Sengun is kind of had a quiet evening but he's getting himself a little bit more motivated here in the second half and that is a foul on Isaac Jones got the wrap around the waist there Sengun is the reigning Western Conference player of the week because he has dominated in fourth quarters and overtimes to to Really drive this team to some important victories Fox Reed Sheppard got some food and here's Thompson coming back the other way tenun the trailer drives it touches paint couldn't convert tipped up went back to Eason Eason underneath he missed the layup and Jones clears the fox nice grab by Jones there Crowder nice look inside Jones they have a lot of trust in Isaac Jones because this is a young man that has not played a lot until the injury bet Trey Lyles and they're going to him in some big time situations trusting him with contact down low which shun going right back at him at the other end bxs running it back quickly after a make Murray spins inside Jones draws the foul goes to the free throw line for a couple of shots Isaac Jones who just four short Five Short years ago was working on a loading dock before a Joo try out and then finally succeeded in Collegiate basketball he's out here doing some grown man stuff in the NBA right now and to me it's the trust turnovers tonight have been phenomenal for the Kings they've taken really good care of the ball but as I mentioned it's a big deal Isaac Jones was so deep on the bench he was not playing and then he started getting little burst of two minutes here three minutes there and fast forward to now where he's being featured heavy minutes and they're trusting him him in a lot of different situations offensiv offensively yeah Sacramento's bench is ranked 27th in points per game so any kind of punch they can get off the bench is going to be helpful lead 11 if that's going to change at all especially now Malik mon kind of in that starting unit at the moment Tari Eason misses there's Jones he has been ubiquitous tonight profoundly so at both ends of the floor Fox with a cross and Fire here's holiday into the front cour back out to Sengun spins on Jones out to the wing Eason pulls the three and knocks it home the lead is down to eight for Sacramento with a little over 9 and2 minutes to go courtesy of that e and bucket Kings trying to hold off a little over nine and a half minutes to play here at Golden a one Center against the Houston Rockets welcome you into the Lazy Boy broadcast boot Mark Jones alongside Katie Christenson some quality bump here tonight we're going to bring in Mike Biby Mike the non sabonis minutes were very productive for Sacramento Jones is out sabonis back in what does Sacramento do at the defensive band with Sengun now Sengun Jones had a great time he came in he came off the bench gave the energy they needed I think he got a little tired but now you bring back in your your go-to guys sabonis I don't think he's going to handle sabonis like that sabonis is more physical bigger body so I can't see him doing the same thing with Domantas well I think the important thing is to realize that they're going to shift their focus now Mike to really feature Sengun a little bit more going forward here in the fourth quarter offensively but I got to ask you about the Kings offense they've done a great job moving the ball how critical against a tough defense like Houston is it for them to really make sure they're getting multiple passes I mean they're doing a great job I think them their their own game came back and bit them you know they they kind of started a little tussle at the begin and kind of lit a fire under the Kings and they haven't looked back since I think this might be the hopefully this is the turning point for them throughout the rest of the season we can only hope that it is thanks a lot Michael hear from you in the postgame show with Kyle thank you rebound and a foul is going to go against the rockets and Tari Eason with 853 to go that's going to be his second foul first team foul in the fourth quarter as DeRozan comes into the ball game for Keegan Murray Murray an exits with 11 points on four of nine really having one of his better shooting nights efficiency wise here's Fox and Keegan's going to get a a few minutes rest and Kevin's going to be out there then he'll come back in and you'll close with the starting five featuring Malik monk who's starting tonight for the second time in his King's career holiday is digging helping out on sabonis monk hesitated on the three and misfired E clears they can get it down to six here the thing is is is that this Houston team Mark has a lot of confidence in close games they've won a couple overtime games here in the last week and the gings have to be very cognizant of not giving them a ton of confidence skip pass to the corner Smith out to VanVleet shot clock at five you don't want to foul here if you're Sacramento VanVleet couldn't turn the corner well defended but that's a guy folks with an NBA championship ring that is a tough tough shot but the important thing is that you made them play almost that entire shot clock fox out to DeRozan the midi comes up a little bit short sabonis with the offensive rebound finds Fox on the blow by Huerter with a clean open look and he threads that thing he is dialed in tonight he's played 22 minutes off the bench he's knocked down three triples he's up to 13 points and he's giving really productive minutes off the bench tonight for Mike Brown and his first came back after missing a couple with that ankle spring and he's battled at the defensive end of the floor too Kat yes he has and bleed around the screen by Sengun Sengun on the pick and roll missed it and here's Fox quickly up Court to monk the cross the drive the dump off one more DeRozan boy they overpass unselfish to a fault and Eason at the other end fouled by Huerter a and I thought that was solid defense by Kevin Huerter backpedaling trying to save a sure bucket in transition and yeah you're talking about a lot of lot of passes here Domantas could have shot it I thought that Demar could have as well but Kevin saves the basket right there really great job not giving up a hoop making him earn it at the free throw line that's a tough position to be put in defensively he's at the free throw line knocks down the first shooting 76% from the stripe and watch how Mike is dialing in his rotations right now and this is something I've been curious to watch with Malik monk in the starting lineup he just gave Keegan Murray about a minute of blow on the side and now he's coming in for Fox and fox is going to get about a minute and then he will come in most likely for Kevin Huerter and then you'll see about the last six minutes of this one is going to be that starting group Monk being guarded by V BL lead on the pick and pop sabonis left it short Eason with a rebound and ble with Pace into the front Court working against hurder and if you're the Kings right now you got to play offensively like you're not expecting a foul and bleet missing the Deep one and here's monk crosscourt to Huerter catch and shoot three boy the building would have exploded it's sa bonus with the offensive board and one Domantas dominant just an absolute beast on the boards Domantas sabonis a Miss from Kevin Huerter who just knocked down the previous three and he is in traffic right here just the extra effort knocks it away from Dillon Brooks and finishes through two Defenders for this rocket Squad and flexing on him right now going to have the opportunity to try and get a free throw and make it 23 points for him on the night meanwhile that's going to be the fourth personal foul against Jabari Smith Junior B us with the edge tonight in the Battle of The Bigs Sengun 12 free throw attempts in this game 21 for this rocket Squad that's a low number for them they are they are a volume free throw shooting team Mark see if they can hit the paint a little bit more maybe have the official blow their whistle Sengun knocks down the Deep three ball that's his first one of the night he's up to 22 on the evening the lead down to six shooting just under 26% from Deep on the season but e Oka gives him a ton of green light they post up DeRozan in that Baseline area and there's going to be a whistl and a foul against the Rockets that's their fourth foul Sacramento will shoot on the next one that is on Sengun and that's what he put up no number nine Dillon Brooks yeah absolutely that backside action there that's his fifth it is and he had to sit a long time when he picked up his fourth monk for three butter drilled it Malik monk he is had kind of a quiet night but he's four of eight from downtown he's got 14 but a double double with 10 assists he is been playmaking for others green raises up from deep and that's going to be a foul against Huerter who has an incredulous look etched across his countenance in disbelief he wants a challenge they're challenging it yeah they're going to challenge this Mike Brown calls timeout they're going to challenge the call on the court the foul was called against Kevin Huerter on that three-point shot by Jalen green here's another look at it a game summary we're going to start off with the three-point shooting of Sacramento tonight not something that they have been doing with great consistency here early in this season but they've got 14 triples here tonight shooting 50% and in the paint their normal dominance a plus 18 doing a great job of limiting the opportunities as well defensively for their opponent Domantas sabonis an absolute Beast down low tonight and then the assists this has been a huge difference maker for Sacramento this is 29 assists for a team that leads the league only allowing 21 assists for their opponents and oh yeah how about just 12 for the Rockets and the good news is that the challenge was successful and they jumped it up Brooks looking inside Sengun against sabonis tries to walk him down gas with a good contest got the stop Eason knocked it Loose missed the layup and here's monk busting out of the p double team this time on DeRozan sabonis back out to monk Fox is still on the bench with 445 to play DeRozan from the corner and rebounded by Eason Brooks on the Run doesn't have numbers steps through whistle contact and that's going to be a night for Dillon Brooks he's done and the defense by Keegan Murray backpedaling in transition drawn the player control foul from Dillon Brooks look at his anticipation right there I'm telling you he might he might just end up with the defensive player of the game Crown tonight he's done a great job let's go back a moment this coach's challenge was presented by sprayed we'll show that to you a moment ago you saw the significance of it where Sacramento was successful in the challenge DeRozan unsuccessful on that shot VanVleet behind the Sengun screen Eason lost it Sengun couldn't convert and tipped in the second one boy he's relentless on the glass Fox bounced pass to Murray pulls it back out now here's sabonis and that has been an area where Houston has absolutely dominated the Kings Tonight a 47 to 29 advantage in rebound Kings it doesn't matter about the boards because they're getting buckets Mark Jones that great dhoo get action with sabonis and monk right here and this is what truly has been a little reprieve for the Kings offensively in terms of the pressure of making Domantas sabonis who's struggled with turnovers recently kind of handled the ball a lot of the time Malik in this starting lineup really doing an excellent job he's got 11 assists in this one and for the first time in a while Katie the ball is really popping offensively 30 assists as you mentioned in a season where the ball hasn't moved quite the way that Coach Brown wanted it to we're seeing less dhos and more pick and rolls good hands my fox pushes it ahead to mon Kings with Pace sabonis inside and the lead is back up to 11 what seemed to be a broken play that they weren't going to get anything out of in an early offense end in a really nice bucket for sabon as they didn't even have to get into a set VanVleet on the Baseline pass to Smith way short here's D Ro and fox running the floor LS it up De'Aaron flying private and this is the type of basketball that the fans in this building truly appreciate when this team gets out and runs but their defense has been leading the way and like I said almost a broken play here but look at the hesitation and then the pass along the Baseline to Domantas sabonis ended up making it into a gym and then right here last possession defense leading to a dunk De'Aaron to De'Aaron in transition for the Throwdown Sacramento Kings with life tonight Reay Fox love the result of that recent sequence I'm a fan of the shirt I want to know where she got that they should have never mess with number five in the first half yeah I mean you said it it was about four minutes left in in the second quarter where Houston started doing Dillon things y yep and now quick word from Jack In The Box the best rated Burger in fast food with more beef than a big ma keep up Ronald welcome to jock in the Box Fox with 22 points 7 assists six rebounds and it all started with about four minutes to go in that second quarter when they said a little bit too much to him and he got that black Air Force energy going yeah and I mean really I mean they turned what has been a strength for Houston All Season here in the early going which is getting teams to kind of take the beta arguing with them here's Smith back out to Green nine on the shot clock Murray switched on to him boy he is a dictatorial type of score he can do it in a lot of different ways but he likes to get downhill or shoot the three sabonis working against Smith missed with the left comes right back to De'Aaron spins and passes Murray sabonis was fouled on that offensive board and he is puzzled as to how he didn't get that's the Smith on Fifth on Jabari Smith Jr one more look here there's just been a ton of contact down low I mean and this is the second part of the play where first Domantas felt he was fouled on his initial shot attempt but he finds himself back at the free throw line where he is 0 of two here tonight bonus KN down the first 83% and we may be looking at the collective surrender Flag by eoko with 235 to go his team down by 12 as a host of Subs come into the ball game Kevin Huerter comes into the game for Demar DeRozan had that big third quarter to help spark the Kings 13 of a 16 coming in that third period bonus missing the mark on the second we're going to have a foul against Sacramento that's just their third team foul that is something that they were able to control was the physicality of this game I mean the Kings got the Rockets into the penalty early in the third uh they've been in it here a while in the fourth get to the free throw line a little bit and then putting this defense on their heels and ble with a logo three comes off sa bonus with the board hey when you when you see your sub coming in for you you're going to get and Murray that's 13 B is kept this might mark this down in the calendar this might proved to be a little bit of a turning point for Murray at the offensive end his defense has still been pretty impregnable throughout the night and how about this every player that has touched the floor and taken a shot for the Kings t tonight are in double figures Jae Crowder is the only player that has played that has not taken a shot attempt he's played 12 minutes come out here for defense ohoka just got ran and we're going to have some extra business Happening Here Yoko is going after official John Goble I mean he's really hot Sengun is out too he's got rejected people are spending money for NBA Charities here tonight it is the season of giving Mark Jones The League office getting some new furniture with he contributions looks like we've had a couple of objections full on laugh in right now I don't know that I've ever seen that before he and De'Aaron really enjoying this this is the type of fire and spirit and passion that you love seeing Sacramento play with well I guess the big question because I haven't looked on the schedule is when's the next time these two teams play it's January 16th knocks down another one the lead is up to 13 and it feels like this one's pretty much done you hate to be precient sometimes but said at the top of the night during The Crossover with Kyle and Mike that there at some point tonight will be extra words extra uh activity some pushing some shoving some talking you're a Seer Mark Jones man it just if you watch Houston and this is what Sacramento might have needed and the crowd in deep appreciation they have been supporting this team who has struggled and underperformed quite frankly early in this season despite you know there's been a number of excuses if you will there's reasoning behind it there's been injuries there's been all kinds of things that they've been dealing with but the question is Mark is this going to be the game that can catapult them into the onto the trajectory that they know that they're capable of Obby Jones inside left it short under 90 seconds to play and part of the good news for Sacramento is that they're going to improve to five and seven at home you cannot afford to give away too many games at the crib yeah that's just the math and the way it works in the NBA let's take a look at what happened with eem adoka a moment ago he was pursuing a passionate conversation with John goldber well there was some words said because there wasn't a lot of of U theatrics until afterwards is Doug McDermott getting in on the action knocking down his first shot of the game mclin turns the corner to Alex Len under minute to go and it's still a 12-point lead for Sacramento the Kings will jump on the charter tomorrow afternoon and head down to the Bluff City Memphis at the Grindhouse and take on a ever improving Memphis Grizzlies team and don't going to take too many chances Aaron holiday knocked down another three his second consecutive one and it's it's a tough back to back on the road you're going to go to Memphis play in for the first time and then the third time against San Antonio the next night a team that you have yet to beat this season lost recently just the previous game to this against weian crew mclin got hung up and gave it away 10 seconds to go Jaeâ€™Sean Tate Adams with the offensive board glin with with the steel and that might be a clear foul that's going to be a take foul right y clear path take foul and they're finally playing the Sacramento Anthem light the beam it's been a minute they've been yearning for it it has not come as much as we had hoped but you got to be very excited about the effort the performance the attention to detail on both ends of the floor tonight and can we just say it again watching De'Aaron and fox get quite frankly infuriated and how it can ignite and Propel this team to do great things they got on his last nerve and he had the last laugh as a result with 22 points sabonis Leading The Way with 27 seven different players as you pointed out Katie in double figur scoring ing the Houston native De'Aaron Fox beating his hometown team dapping up fellow Kentucky grad Reed Sheppard hey that's the way basketball is supposed to be a little jaw jacking a little bit of talk popping your stuff and going home with the dub as Sacramento improves to 10 and 12 on the season the Rockets ball to 15 and seven Fox of the Kings get their first win in Emirates NBA cup action that'll do it from here folks for Katie Christensen and for our talented crew behind the camera you
