 at the Garden yep and it's going to be fun to see these two new additions play in this Celtics uniform porzingis and Jrue holiday two of the biggest Acquisitions in the off season Jayson Tatum defended by Quentin Grimes porzingis over Robinson knocks down a three yeah he's so gifted with that three-point shot watching him in warm-ups he's goes through a rigorous routine knocking down threes and he is perfecting that stroke now five for six in the preseason from the three-point line is Kristaps screen set by Sims for DiVincenzo looking for Robinson inside deflect it out off the hand of Jayson Tatum yeah and this Knick's starting lineup they're known for defense I mean these are five guys that have earned the trust of Tom tho on the defensive end of the floor they're going against some good offensive players so let's see if they can hold up seven on the shot clock Lu McBride into the paint and his shot rejected by Jrue holiday run three Derrick white yeah Celtics are always going to look to shoot that three ball they average 16 made threes in the regular season last year that was third in the NBA so they really exploit teams from the three-point line transition is a great opportunity to get open once here's St ceto from downtown yeah Donte in his New York Knick uniform starting to get comfortable Tom Tibido mentioned he's ahead of the curve on the defensive end of the floor catching up on offense getting used to his teammates Brown off the side of the rim Celtics with a couple of Threes And then Donte DiVincenzo answered here's McBride knocking down a three continuing to stroke it four for four last game was Duce McBride 16 big points four for four from that three-point line hits his first one here here's porzingis from behind the AR so the Knicks who fell behind six nothing with a couple of three-point field goals have tied the score just underway in Boston the bride steps behind the line fires over white and it's rebounded by Tatum good aggressive this aggressiveness by dece McBride looking to score now Tatum backing his way in on bribes the first two-point field goal of tonight's game the cide direct in traffic Celtics with a two-point lead Robinson up top def by Brown shot clock down to five Pride kicks it back out stenzo off the back of the rim from three two and a half in first quarter from TD Garden in Boston Grimes hit in the face Celtics turn it over there's Sims slams it home two onone with Robinson and Sims took it all the way and that was a business decision by Kristaps porzingis he did not want to get posterized by Jericho Sims who had that step and he almost hit his head on the rim boys he explosive Corner three from White in and out Hicks on an 8-2 run DiVincenzo gets turn it over quick transition by the Celtics white driving on Jericho Sims stayed right with him in the paint now Brown on Sims holiday on the fin no good and then it's tapped in by porzingis poring some good defensive pressure Wally by from Jericho Sims Time Out New York timeout taken by the Knicks with three and a half gone here in the first quarter trailing the Celtics by two yeah Quentin Grimes going against an First Team all NBA performer gets the steal on Jayson Tatum and then in the fast break here comes Jericho Sims watch watch out Kristaps Porzingis you want no part of that back in Boston Celtics leading the knck by two Knicks fans put yourself on the map to celebrate the return of Knick's basketball we are calling on all New Yorkers to help us score a basket on every Court in New York before opening night head to your nearest Court get a bucket film it upload it to our interactive map let's hoop W I'm sure you've scored hoops at most of those courts around the New York area I have a lot of Long Island courts and uh there you see out tonight RJ Barrett Jaylen Brunson Josh Hart Julius Randle and Emanuel quickley really the core of this New York Knicks roster so this is an opportunity for other guys to step up and so far they're competing well with the starters of the Celtics BR Grimes one of the regular starters knocks down of three yep running pick and roll too he got a nice screen got a little bit of a step and Quentin Grimes has a really quick release got it up nothing but net the Knick's third three-point field goal and now the first foul of the game it's DiVincenzo committing his first Divincenzo that's his first team first what do you like Wally about the acquisition of DiVincenzo well he's a winner start with that won an NCA championship and an NBA championship like you mentioned boy the threes are really falling right now for both teams Jaylen Brown knocks down that big time triple that's good to see for both teams in the preseason everyone has their legs and their three-pointers are all dialed in but Donte is just going to really solidify this back court I think back court depth is a huge Advantage for the Knicks if a guy goes down little knickknack injury oh there's Mitchell Robinson with a nice finish then um the Knicks are going to be fine to fill and plug those gaps DiVincenzo w a title with buet over back in 2018 and then three years later with the Milwaukee Bucks Celtics turn it over Knicks on the Run here's Grimes on the feed from DiVincenzo fires over porzingis and Nails a three no hesitation this is an opportunity for Quentin Grimes to take those shots with a little bit more aggressiveness and he's shooting himself into Rhythm foris no good from the high The Arc long rebound Grimes with it t defending Knicks four for seven from downtown to start this game DiVincenzo takes it inside on porzingis Robinson on the follow what a phenomenal Camp he's had and a phenomenal preseason you can see his upper body his chest his arms look stronger and that's going to help him hopefully avoid injury Jaylen Brown again from three just rain in triples the highest paid player in the NBA Kenny over $300 million Jaylen Brown signed a contract extension with the Celtics in the off season while he herc type numbers Here Comes holiday true holiday so the Celtics have tied it after the dicks went on a 70 run Yep this game is really back and forth du MC CDE a little careless with that behind the back pass but right now the Knicks compete level is high and that's a good sign rento bottled up double team to the floor tied up out of Celtics it'll be Celtics basketball there's the villain overa Brit that's why you win championships sell out for your team sell out for the game ultimate competition level Donte Divincenzo is going to be a crowd favorite just like Josh Hart immediately was when he came to the Knicks the garden faithful absolutely love these villain NOA guys they love playing at MSG they had a lot of success in college at the Garden playing in the Big East tournament uh and playing a lot of their games there so Donte is going to be a great addition he stepped out of bounds while battling for the basketball porzingis knocks down another three Celtics on an 80 run after the Knicks scored seven consecutive points Sam Houser and Al Horford have checked in for the Celtics the Knicks called timeout just past the Midway Point first quarter here in Boston traing the Celtics by three the Westbrook is is a big influence of why you know I play so hard and I wear the number zero um it's what I grew up watching um he always had a you know he had a saying still does it's called why not um and I kind of lived by that going up in you know into high school like why couldn't I get a free education then I got into college and why couldn't I make the NBA so um that was one and then the big the biggest influence on me has been Jrue holiday uh um growing up watching him um playing for the Sixers um Hometown team for me so for it to come full circle for me to play with him to win the championship with him um he's taught me a lot on and off the court yeah I'll tell you that's a good role model to uh to emulate Jrue holiday just the ultimate teammate plays hard a winner and just his point of attack defensive aggressiveness right here you can see it getting around that screen he's one of the best both on the court here McBride nice touch yeah to McBride starting to get confidence in his shot you know last year he's great Off the Bench you know defensively struggled a little bit shoo the basketball but he's a young player that can improve that three-point shot and that jumper off the steel Grimes feeds St shenzo does not get the roll and then Horford with the hustle knocks it out off Donte demenzo I'll tell you Al Horford the Ageless one he has done so many good things in his Celtics uniform coming off the bench here I think the Celtics were experimenting with a little bit more of an offensively potent lineup we'll see what they do in the regular season but now is always going to be there for defense Sims with the rejection it's ring set by porzingis on DiVincenzo here's holiday on the fade and a loose ball foul committed by DiVincenzo that's his second Jericho Sims and Mitchell Robinson in the starting lineup and out on the floor it I've said it before it's going to be tough to get baskets around the rim both these guys are elite shot blockers you saw there Jericho Sims great timing great athleticism with that block offord Celtics now lead by three four and a half remaining first quarter from TD Garden here's McBride from downtown in and out porzingis the rebound Knick still have their five starters on the floor getting set to make changes Horford from behind the ark everyone can shoot on this Celtics roster they really look to shoot that three-point shot and use that as a weapon I mentioned 16 made threes a game last season number two in the whole entire NBA they take them and make them at a high percentage Divincenzo knocks down to three this is a good sign for the Knicks DiVincenzo the first couple preseason games you know didn't really get an opportunity to be aggressive offensively tonight he's being aggressive Jaylen Brown takes it all the way taquan Jeff at Isaiah hartstein getting set to check in for the Knicks three and a half on the clock first quarter even chenzel looking underneath turns it over New York number Enzo will sit down with six points two personal fouls Mitchell Robins to the bench Four Points three rebounds for Mitch yeah Mitchell Robinson again doing his job offensive glass number one in the NBA on the offensive glass as far as offensive rebounds put back offensive rebound percentage all that good stuff Mitchell Robinson doing his thing on the offensive end porzingis on the feet from Tatum I tell you he is fit in nicely Celtics uniform feeding off Tatum and brown Jrue holiday finding him for open looks he looks good Grimes from three chased down by Sims 10 points for porzingis hick with eight on the shot clock they work it around into the far corner for Grimes out a fou is called f on the Celtics number Z Jayson T Jayson Tatum commit the first Celtics first foul and that's rare the Knicks are normally a team that gets to the free throw line quite a bit number two in the NBA at attacking the basket getting to that free throw line so right now without the normal Knick starters you can see that's a little bit of a deficit not having guys that can use their physical tools to get to contact and get to the free throw line LK white is checked back in for Boston along with Payton Pritchard who leads the Celtics and scoring during the pre-season strong move to the hoop by mcry yeah beast mode move by Pride you saw Payton Pritchard on him and he said I'm going to attack him he's got a little bit of size and strength over Payton bitchard got the easy two seven points for McBride and now Tatum knocks down a three Celtics 7even of 11 from downtown this is Boston's biggest lead rymes from three hit the floor and it's rebounded by tayton quick out with Pritchard driving on McBride Horford short Micks back the other way as we approach two minutes remaining of the first here's Grimes kicks it out Grimes cuts the Boston lead to Six White rebounded by Sims Ain Jeffries with that last bucket here's McBride up with the left hand and fouled by Pritchard foul on number 11 Payton that's his I don't know what Payton Pritchard is arguing about cuz there was body contact arm contact there was everything on that play and in the head had the head too but Payton Pritchards had a good preseason averaging 21.3 points per game that is number three in the NBA as far as preseason scoring boring he signed that nice little contract 4 years 30 million just about a couple weeks ago and he's really played well he's gotten that opportunity and these Boston Celtics are going to need him to play meaningful minutes um with how front loaded they are with their roster and their Acquisitions that they've got Evan Fournier has checked in for the Knicks he's been shooting the ball really well and there's a lot of Pride as a veteran there's two SM Pride knocking down the free throw and you know he's put in the work in the off season you know had a pretty good stint with Frank in the world championships in the feeble World Cup and um now he's come in ready to play knocking down shots for the Knicks here's Tatum Off the Mark rebounded by Fournier those McBride free throws the first free throw attempts of this game H Stein's pass picked off Horford beating Hauser driving on McBride and he was fouled hey yor R's first personal sending Sam Hauser to the free throw

leading by nine their biggest lead sh clock down to five 48 rolls a foul Jayson Tatum not happy these these Boston Celtics are attacking the Knicks on the defensive end of the floor their traps have been very aggressive and you cannot make passes like that cuz Celtics guys all have long arms they really cover ground very rangy and when they get steals they are looking to attack immediately and make the Knicks play make the Knicks pay for turning the ball over running into the three-point line run into the basket getting easy buckets right now the Knicks have to settle in cuz the Celtics have 38 points already in this first quarter they are really taking it to the Knicks on the offensive end of the floor 4 averaging 13 over the first two games Knicks keep it alive with the offensive rebound here's Daquan Jeff from three pulled down by Derrick white down to 30 seconds Tatum from behind the ark 3 second differential game clock shot clock Bost now nine of 15 from downtown 60% cornier drives past Hauser here's Sims little be Celtics basketball with four and 510 seconds remaining thans better get ready the Celtics are coming here's Pritchard time winding down and it out Celtic with nine threes in the first quarter Le the knck after one here in Boston by the score of 41 to 30 yeah this has been a high octane first quarter Kenny strap him up Knicks better figure out a way to defend that three-point line nine3 is way too many for the Celtics in my top five all time that guy all he did was win dominate his era win championships outstanding human being also uh we will definitely miss him rest in peace B Russell Isaiah Roby and Ryan Arcidiacono have checked in for the Knicks as we begin the second quarter along with Fournier hartenstein and Jeff Luke Kornet the ex Knick in the game for the first time tonight for the Celtics white from three dribble penetration off screen en roll in transition you name it the Celtics are just absolutely on fire from the three-point line and the Knicks have to figure out a way to defend that line a little bit better Celtics now 10 threes 10 of 17 Isaiah Ruby knocks down to three yeah Knicks are trying to hang in Knicks are actually shooting the three ball pretty well on their own end it's just the fact that the Celtics are absolutely lighting it up Roby in his fifth NBA season three years in Oklahoma City one season with San Antonio J Jayson Tatum with the 11th Boston three-point field goal and he's exploiting the Knick centers who aren't used to defending that three-point line for for the rebound of the hartenstein Miss three Knicks get back here's white driving Baseline and a blocking foul is the call as Arcidiacono hits the floor yeah Tom Tibido wondering about that call Ryan Arcidiacono abs absolutely took a shot to the face as Derrick white was ripping the ball through caught him right in the chin and Ryan Arch is like whoa how did that I thought he was kind of set and I thought you know that little swim move by DK white could have been an offensive foul but Ryan Arch took it right there see it right on the nose Celtics Down lead the Knicks 50 to 33 dicks of course play without Randle Barrett Brunson har quickly tonight Stein as you mentioned Celtics arrested most of their regular in the game at the Garden 114 107 Knicks Victory yep and the Celtics you know second string guy they played competitively they kept out a game pretty much most of the game competed pretty hard against the Knicks first unit you know they're trying to figure out guys to fill out their roster but now you can see how good the Celtics are when they have all their guys had a look at Joe muli the seconde head coach Celtics won 57 games a season ago reach game seven of the East final bigan Jeff from three in and out and Ryan Arcidiacono has been putting the game to kind of stabilize the Knicks offense too many turn overs in that first quarter here's Tatum nice move he has been putting the Knicks Big Man on skates pick and roll pulling up from the three-point line he's taking advantage of guys that can't keep up with his speed 13 points for Tatum Jeff keeps it alive here's hartenstein Celtics lead is 15 early second quarter here in Boston as Horford keeps it alive for the Celtics from three Tatum again and Jayson Tatum struggled a little bit in the first couple preseason games wasn't shooting the ball really at a high percentage like he's used to so it looks like to me he came into this game focused ready to get back on track cuz he has been absolutely lights out to start this one Kenny 16 points for Tatum he's four of five from behind the ark yeah he's First Team all NBA player pretty much ranked in the top five of the NBA he can score in any different way when he gets that three ball going he is so tough to stop he's on fire right now welcome back to Boston our Monica mcnut recently spoke with Julius Randle and she asked Julius about the surprise Jersey retirement at his high school in Plato Texas this past summer it was really cool uh my wife uh mom did a good job of of keeping it from me my son he almost gave it away Kaiden cuz he likes to talk a lot uh but yeah they did a good job of keeping it from me but it was it was cool um just because I can have my family there and uh I got to see everybody uh from old uh teammates uh high school friends to Old coaches mentors um teachers everything um that you know people that you know started the this journey with me and you know poured a lot into not just Julius Randle the basketball player but the person stay with us at halftime to hear more from Julius Randle his conversation with Monica mcnut the Jersey retirement at Prestonwood Christian Academy Plano Texas as a senior Julius average 32 points 22 rebounds per game we could see that he averaged 25 plus and 10 in the NBA so as a high school player I couldn't could only imagine how dominant Julius was and congratulations to Julius for that accomplishment I know you always enjoy returning to your high school reliving some of the Glory Days absolutely every time I walk in that Jersey's just retired right there as you walk in special times for me and my family you know uh sharing those moments high school was a lot of fun you know we had a good run we lost to Elton brand and the New York State semifinals of the state championship um but uh memories that I'll have forever with a lot of those guys I grew up with you know the feeling Julius and his number 30 now retired at Prestonwood Christian Academy great job by monik 15-point lead for the Celtics shot clock down to Three for8 Fires across Arcidiacono from downtown off the back of the rim there's Jaylen Brown spinning on Arcidiacono Sims over to help out holiday fouled by hartenstein new yor 55 that is his first team third Micks with hartenstein Fournier Roby Jeff and Arcidiacono on the floor here's porzingis wide open from three Kristaps Porzingis now with 13 his third three-point field goal I mean it's going to be tough to guard the Boston Celtics you're trying to contain Jaylen Brown who was an 25 Point per game score and then he dishes it off the KP as a 23o per game score Hartenstein looking for the foul down below they come at you quickly tum with the feet underneath look like brown wasn't ready for it here's white from three rebounded by Roby just under seven minutes remaining second quarter there's Fournier back out Hartenstein from three that's a good sign Isaiah hartenstein has been known to be able to knock down three-point shots but he kind of abandoned to taking them last year in the New York Knick uniform was really effective on the offensive glass but at times he can soften up the defense with that three seven points in 9 minutes for hartenstein in his second season as a Knick FAL by Isaiah Roby and here's Evan Fournier doing a good job he knows how to run the screen and roll and breaks down that defense gets into the paint Kristaps porzingis overh helps a little bit trying to get the block shot and Isaiah hartenstein possible for him to roll to the basket and get a maybe an easy two or a layup but if you can stretch the defense knock down that three off a pick and pop scenario that can really pose a lot of problems for the de Donte DiVincenzo checks back in DiVincenzo with Roby Hartenstein Fournier and Arcidiacono for the Knicks Arcidiacono driving on Pritchard back the other way come to Celtics here's Tatum backing his way in on for the former Celtic and a foul is called it's the fifth team foul Fournier the personal Fournier second so tton will head back to the free throw line last season becoming the first Celtic in their franchise history to average 30 points per game that is incredible Larry Bird Bird high was 29.9 oh back in the late 1980s yeah it's a totally different game though scores weren't as high scoring although the Celtics and Lakers they put up some points you know Showtime loved to run the ball up and down and so did those Boston Celtic teams they were scoring well into the 110s 120s but the new NBA the record books are absolutely getting shattered offensively because of the pace because of the change in rules you got to remember too when you get an offensive rebound the shock clock doesn't reset to 24 it only resets to 14 so that enables more possessions in a game as a result more scored right that was a big change a couple of years ago M Tatum last season led the NBA in total points made a Celtics debut six years ago tonight in Cleveland Roby Comm miss the personal made contact with brown New York on number 25 isah that's his second team these this these Celtic stars are just coming into their Prime really Jayson Tatum and his sixth year in the NBA Jaylen brown right around the same I mean these guys are coming into a point where this is where they're going to be playing their best basketball and their bodies look completely mature completely physically developed great strength there's my own teammate s pel always chattering in the locker room he one of the most clutch players of all time in the NBA outstanding point guard outstanding addition to this Celtics bench as far as on the coaching staff to stabilize the coach staff with some serious experience samel brings table line another Sam Hauser checks in for the Celtics mitell Robinson back on the floor pulls down the rebound pressure in the back court from the Celtics cornier from three fancy footwork by holiday here's Pritchard from downtown Shooters all over the place for the Celtics and Jrue holiday gets that loose ball such a smart player also Jrue holiday in 2020 is on the Olympic team won a gold metal so he has a quite a resume to so now with 14 threes as we approach 5 minutes remaining second quarter in Boston there it go Sims getting set to check back in for the kns there's Hauser quarter three from j a 12 Celtics run there's Roby underneath for Robinson good look Celtics have 70 points with 4 and A2 minutes left in the second quarter they are absolutely playing also they're they're pretty much regular season lineups they're trying to find a bench and trying to find chemistry with guys coming off the bench to play with some starters they're playing big minutes are all their starters and the on the other hand without five key players in Randle Barrett Brunson par and quickley tonight 45 J the Knicks now have thebride Grimes Robinson Sims on the floor here's mbde works his way inside and Robinson in perfect position slams it home always in perfect position he is cleaning the glass on the offensive end of the floor doing a great job he cleaning up all those misses Celtics scored 41 points in the first quarter now lead 70 to 47 sh clock is down to three Brown over Sims 24 second shot clock violation 24 second violation New York ball and another thing to keep an eye on Kenny is Quentin Grimes and Mitchell Robinson obviously you know in the starting lineup they're playing tonight it's a back-to-back scenario and the Knicks are going to want to you know give them meaningful minutes tomorrow to get ready because it's their final preseason game to get ready for the regular season the following week so let's keep an eye on their minutes do committed by demenzo that's his third that's his third personal team so what will Tom thibo and his staff be looking to see tomorrow night in that final preseason game well similar to what the Celtics are doing they're going to start their pree their their regular season I imagine starting lineup they want to get them meaningful minutes first eight minutes or so in that first quarter then they want to figure out the rotations when the bench comes in what's the unit that's going to be starting the second quarter that's a key unit that was normally RJ Barett starting with that unit so I think they're going to play to win that game and they're going to play to get guys up minutes up around 30 uh to prepare them for the regular season Hauser hitting both free throws Celtics now lead 7247 Hicks break through the pressure Brown hits the floor contact from Sims here's Grimes and now a foul is called it's on Hauser that's his first personal first got a technical foul might be on Jaylen Brown a technical foul has been called on the Celtics number seven J Brown DiVincenzo hits the free throw Jericho Sims playing point guard got the chicken Wing a little bit too high on that one Jaylen Brown didn't like it Sams dising off for Robinson and he gets the roll Mitchell Robinson now with 10 points five rebounds in great hands showing that was a tough pass you know by uh Jericho Sims but Mitchell Robinson showing good hands getting those putbacks easy to Richard with a corner three Richard Richard scored 21 in the game at MSG has nine points and 9 minutes here tonight he's been playing really well in the preseason when he's got in minutes the guy can flat out shoot from anywhere over half court divento knocks down at three third from behind the arc for Donte DiVincenzo tonight he joins Robinson in double figures with 10 here's Brown around demenzo and then good defense from McBride forcing the turnover here's Grimes over Pritchard KN down to three and the Celtics call timeouts yeah Joe Missoula not happy with the turnover by Jaylen Brown and Quentin Grime makes Quentin Grimes Mak some pay Celtics kicking it in gear held an open practice on Sunday at the Garden Tom tho is miked up several former dicks FR hand many he took part in a celebrity game as well it's more electure just to see everybody here in the stands and especially all the kids you know for all the kids I mean to come out on on their weekend and support us man it's great great environment great atmosphere many time you know my name's called everybody goes crazy so I love it you are automatic I play for I play for some great coaches in my day but if coach Fat Joe says I got a green light guess what we got the green light baby we it's going up you always get that same feeling when you walk through that tunnel I haven't walked through that tunnel in years so it feels good man there's a big proud out here this is New York New York Fan Nation baby shout out to the Knick fans stay loyal stay patient so we can bring that title to New York City one day what a great day for Knicks fans of all ages really cool too some old names old faces I used to play against good to see them in the garden and the Celebrity Game Jayson Tatum another bucket on the offensive end of the floor he's looking looking really good right now in mid-season form just too big too strong overpowers Donte Divincenzo at six Ines on Donte Donte DiVincenzo right there under the basket now Donte DiVincenzo is a good rebounder he's going to battle down low he's going to fight but Jayson Tatum right now has found his stroke he's playing his best basketball of the preseason coming into that big time match up to start the season with the New York Knicks Tatum now with 23 points porzingis and Sims in a collision it will be Knicks basketball yeah Boston's working on their press right now they're really giving the Knicks fits Point cards can't really figure out a way to break that press and one thing about when a team presses you especially in the NBA you're going to have numbers and you're going to have opportunities to get easy looks at the basket and the Knicks have to try to attack that pressure SOA calls timeout with a minute 32 on the clock here in quarter number two you heard from Julius Randle earlier spoke with Monica about the surprise Jersey retirement coming up at the half much more of that sit down Monica mcnut and Julius Randle yeah it's going to be very interesting you know Julius Randle had an off season where he was rehabbing his ankle spending a lot of time with his wonderful wife and wonderful family and he's ready to go you know he's recharged he's had two out of his three monster year two out of his four years have been monster years with the New York Knicks and it's a big year for Julius Randle Big Year you know he's kind of the Wy veteran in that locker room at 28 years old so it's going to be a fun listen to hear what he's been up to and hear what he plans to bring this season Celtics challenged that last play initially ruled that it deflected out off porzingis be Boston and Bost Celtics challenge was successful yeah you can see Jericho Sims was a last one to touch it it looks like por looked like porzingis tipped it which he might have but once you super slow-mo it Jericho Sims right there was the last hand that it touched I like this new rule too Kenny when you get that first challenge correct you keep your timeout you get another challenge now when you make the Second Challenge then you lose your timeout but that means you just have to preserve your timeouts and hey that might lead to a little bit more flow in the game there's not as many timeouts when the coaches try to stop runs Celtics lead by 22 the Steel by McBride there's Grimes driving and he was fouled by holiday holid yeah Dre holiday careless you know Miles is playing those pass passing lanes and this is a good job by the Knicks attacking and you know Jrue holiday it's it's amazing how he's been on so many different teams obviously the great years with the Pelicans then he moved over to the Milwaukee Bucks where he won a championship but doesn't matter where he plays with what team he plays with different type of personnel around him he is just one of the top blue guy type players in the NBA fits so many different roles he guards all five positions he can guard centers if you need him to guard centers he really makes a coach's job easy with his abilities out there on the floor began his career in Philadelphia that's right he was a first round pick by the Sixers way back in 2009 now at his 15th NBA season and he looks great I mean he looks as explosive quick fast as ever final minute second quarter D clock down to seven Grimes on the return from Robinson Robinson B for it pulls it down blocked from behind by porzingis demenzo back here's Brown Robinson at the other end now to the final half minute the bride from three confidence is oozing from dece McBride right now from that three-point line this is a really good sign if he can keep his confidence to shoot the basketball it's not easy playing spot minutes defense is going to be there but you got to knock down those open threes when you get them when exra hit 11 threes Celtics with 16 White's pass underneath broken up by Donte DiVincenzo 10 seconds remaining in the quarter down to five DiVincenzo fires from three in and out pingis the rebound first half nine made two-point field goals so they are really exploiting the Knicks from that three-point line taking advantage the analytics both teams going with their starting five from the first quarter as Robinson hits the floor number n Derrick white fou committed by Derrick white that's his first firstam foul first quarter we went over 9 minutes without a foul on either side yeah it was it was some fluid basketball in that first quarter everyone was knocking down threes seemed like teams were running right to that three-point line but uh let's see if this game slows down a little bit because that first first half was a really fast-paced game here's withc bride teams combined for 27 three-point field goals in the first half Celtics 16 of 29 55% Knicks were 11 of 25 44% from behind the ark and how about Duce mcpride with 14 points getting the opportunity to start showing that he can run the pick and roll and run the point guard position for the Knicks he's really taking advantage of this opportunity in his minutes 14 points couple of steals three assists 9 seconds on the 24 here's Brown double team shot clock at two for zis rebounded by Sims jco Sims with five rebounds made the start tonight for the Knicks feeds Robinson and he was hit from behind by Derrick white that's the second time Jericho Sims has found Mitchell Robinson down low the two big guys doing a good job of sharing the ball Jericho Sims does a good job drawing defense and getting Kristaps porzingis up in the air Mitchell Robinson is bummed he didn't get a chance to finish that but Mitch knows that's The Scouting Report make him earn him from the free throw line he's been working on his Arc that's the key let's keep an eye on his Arc he's got good form he's got to get that thing up and over the rim like that his first trip to the line tonight has 11 points seven rebounds how many free throws would you shoot after practice on a typical day um not too many uh you know I I at times I used to think less is more you know you don't have to over overwork your your stroke just I was a percentage guy if I shot 10 I had to make nine or else I would shoot another 10 um you know that was just my challenging myself to make my shots efficient and practice efficiently did you usually make nine of the first 10 most of the time but you know you have some off there's Grimes from three Quentin Grimes has found a stroke that's a really good sign and you know he's one of the starters that made the trip he's gotten meaningful minutes and he's produced in those meaningful minutes he's uh had a good game right now with 12 points he's got the three assist to go along with those 12 points and the Knicks have scored the first seven points here in the third they've pulled to within 11 holiday kicks it back out from three Brown short so a good start to this third quarter by the Knicks McBride from three by the way Wally you were an 86% career free throw shooter so I guess you made 8.6 out of every 10 at least in games here's holiday and the foul holiday what a move Jrue holiday hasn't really been that aggressive looking for his offense and that's kind of how he plays the game he's a true point guard he got looks to set up his teammates for the first two and a half three quarters but but if he needs to score in that fourth quarter he's one of the most productive guys to finish games and that was a nice little craft crafty move right there here's McBride in and out so the Knicks cut the lead to 11 it's now 14 Robinson with the steal McBride no good off the back of the rim from three Tatum directing traffic screen set by porzingis Tatum unable to connect Celtics keep it alive shot clock at 10 there's Brown out to porzingis Off the Mark another offensive rebound but a foul was called it's on T Tatum's third personal foul Al haford replaces Kristaps spz game replacing W zing and you can see the Knicks and the coaching staff has made some adjustments at halftime to get out to that three-point line uh you know that the shots have been a little bit more contested the Celtics aren't in as comfortable and in as much of the Rhythm as they were to start the game Celtics just one of six here in the third quarter timeout taken by the Knicks early third quarter in Boston some thrilling season openers the last couple years against the Celtics last year's game was a really exciting one and it's important for the Knicks to get off to a good start cuz they have a tough schedule to start the season then they hit the road after that first game against the Celtics ball committed by Derrick white if you join us late Knicks without Julius Randle RJ Barrett Jaylen Brunson Josh Hart and Emanuel quickly tonight Celtics going with all of their regulars Maks out a 73 run to begin the third quarter sh clck down to five McBride pulls it back out McBride from three rebounded by holiday here's Brown taking it all the way Robinson with the rebound and he was fouled Morford commits the personal 42 alord that's his first team liit Celtics in the penalty so Mitchell Robinson will head back to the line hit both of his prior attempts he's been working at this really diligently in the off season he knows it's important for him to get these percentages up because he gets to the free throw line a ton you know with all those offensive rebounds it's got good form normally it's straight the key is just getting that lift under the ball and giving it an opportunity to go in Robinson misses both knocked out of bounds by Sims he hit two earlier in the quarter misses these two attempts Celtics lead by 148 and half remaining in the third thanks for joining us tonight on MSG here's Brown around Sims knocks it down 12 points for Jaylen Brown Celtic's lead is back up to 16 demenzo draws a foul Brown whistled for the block fou on number seven J BR that is his first team liit so Donte DiVincenzo to the free throw line DiVincenzo with starting lineup tonight now has 11 started 36 games last season for Golden State after a year in Sacramento prior Four Seasons in Milwaukee stenzo knocks down both free throws Celtics lead up to 14 at 39% from the three-point line too with golden state so you you got a lot of open looks playing with Brothers but he can shoot he's a really good catch and shoot guy and he can also handle strong move to the hoop by Jaylen Brown really strong move Mitchell Robinson off the switch tried to take away that three because he had been burned by a couple threes in the first half and Jaylen got the step and finish big time scen set by Sims for DiVincenzo kept Alive by Grimes shot clock at four as Grimes fires and hits from three this is a great sign for the Knicks to get grimes's confidence you know he can really shoot the basketball and he can make them in bunches and he is lighting it up tonight 16 points for Quentin Grimes tonight leenz with the rebound of the Tatum Miss divento from behind the ark just under seven to play third quarter Celtics lead now 13 here's hav straightway three Horford battling for it DiVincenzo strips it away and then off the fingertips of grindes Tatum blocked by Sims Celtics have missed all five of their three-point attempts here in the third quarter talked about the Knicks halftime adjustments defensively D clock winding down now it's three MC right to a right open Grimes Grimes Nails it and the Knicks have pulled to within 10 19 points for Grimes Grimes can absolutely shoot and that quick release comes in handy uh when the shot clock has come counting down like that that was big he's hit six three-point field goals holiday answers at the other end mix call timeout they pulled it within 10 it's now a 13 Point Boston Celtics lead yeah Tom 1510 here in the third quarter w a look at Grimes numbers over the final nine games of the 2022 23 season those are some big time numbers he really finished the stretch shooting the basketball at a really high level you know he's a young player he continues to get better and it's a Donte DiVincenzo knocks down that technical free throw and it's a tough role being a guy that's not that doesn't always have the ball in your hands you know he's a guy that's feeding off all the other teammates you know he's waiting in the corner at times for double teams to come he does get a lot of open looks but the fact that you know he come came up with a 47% and then a 39% season that's really sharp shooting from the outside and he's been showing it tonight DiVincenzo on the reverse and a foul is called pford commits to personal and the Knicks have done a good job since the first quarter when they had six turnovers they only have three turnovers since and you know that's a big point of emphasis for Tom tibo's teams he does not like to turn the ball over because that leads to easy transition opportunities and he can't set his vaunted defense on the other end of the floor when teams are scrambling when his team is scrambling so uh you know the guards have done a good job and taking care of the ball since that first quarter when it was a little bit healthy sceleton three consecutive free throws by Devon Cento the first after the technical foul assess to Celtics head coach Joe moua and now it outs down two more pulling the Knicks back to within 10 the defense here by Sims ja clock down to three Tatum from downtown now that's a bail out three that was great defense by the Knicks but that possession is why the Boston Celtics didn't win the NBA championship and didn't get out of the East too stagnant on the offensive end of the floor The Pride offensive rebound DiVincenzo from three Celtics lead by 13 just under five to play third quarter here's Brown from behind the ark ienzo with the rebound pass picked off by Tatum then the Knicks taken right back Grimes wide open Quentin Grimes with his seventh three-point field goal tonight now has 22 points and these are not even hitting the rim we got a flamethrower here at the TD Garden here Kenny this is fun to watch Quentin Grimes absolutely in the zone lighting it up from outside and his teammates are doing a great job of finding him for good looks Grimes High during the regular season last year with seven threes in a game now the Steel by McBride McBride driving on Tatum up with the left hand and he BS it in the Knicks have pulled to within eight they've trailed by as many as 27 Joe moula wants to talk things over Joe manoula needs to talk things over Duce McBride goes high off the glass with the left hand look at the double team too much dribbling by these Boston Celtics not enough ball movement too much one-on-one and then Duce goes high with the finger roll George gerin style over Jayson Tatum outstanding defense Jericho Sims using his strength using his length to get that deflection and then on the fast break Duce McBride taking advantage of his opportunity to get meaningful minutes and absolutely putting on a show for the New York Knick fans and also the coaching staff Knicks have outscored the Celtics 2313 here in the third quarter du McBride 16 points four assists so far tonight yeah and it was a little shaky in that first quarter just figuring out you know how to get guys in the right spots running the team but ever since he has looked very comfortable getting that opportunity to get that second wave of minutes he has been ready to play he's been outstanding on the defensive end of the floor and his offense has really complimented his great defense Knick host Washington tomorrow final preseason game Knick and Celtics a week from tomorrow tuned to MSG for pre and post game and then will play back-to- back games against Atlanta and New Orleans over the first weekend of the regular season that's a good call the game is on ESPN at but MSG will be having a pre and post game I'll be there with Bill pedo Allen Han and Company we'll be having some fun and

half Celtics with only two threes in the second half they hit 16 over the first two quarters Tatum crosscourt Brown as Hartenstein goes flying by and brown knocks it down time of New York Mi call time they cut the Boston lead to eight it's now a 13-point game back in Boston late third quarter Micks Trail by as many as 27 cut the Celtics lead to eight moments ago taquon Jeff on the floor for the

shot clock VI ation Knick did not agree they thought it did did hit the rim I think officials getting together let's see whist basketball 23 seconds on the shot they reset the shot clock it will be Celtics basketball I think that's the right call cuz the rebound was in the Celtic's hands so it will be Celtics possession B libido chatting with Ry aosta so the Celtics with a 15-point lead down to a minute 15 on the clock here in the third porzingis gets the r he's really good in pick and roll really good he can pop to the three-point line he can roll that's a tough shot for a seven-footer to stop on a dime and hit that little floater in the paint but foring a feathery touch to knock down that shot 90 Celtics run hartenstein puts an end to that streak points for Isaiah H defended by Grimes out to 40 seconds Horford up to set the screen Horford driving blocked by Sims that's his third rejection it's fun to watch Jericho Sims defend the rim Al Horford is a is a big dude got the step and if Jericho Sims didn't have a 40 plus vertical he wouldn't have been able to reach that ball to block it here we go we got another timeout 31 seconds to go in the third quarter timeout taken by the

was crazy cuz I got traded to Seattle but then I got traded back to Cleveland mid through A3 Midway Through The Following season and I ended up guarding Ray Allen in the second round of the playoffs we took the Celtics to 7 seven games lost by four in Boston Garden in game seven and then the Celtics went on to beat Detroit and then La in the finals to win that Championship in 2008 but uh that was a great series LeBron tall Pierce that game seven that's one that uh will go down in the record books is one of the greatest game sevens of all time how strange was it to face so many recent former teammates during that playoff series yeah it was crazy but uh you know Kevin Garnett was a recent teammate there's dayquon Jeff knocking down that three Kevin Garnett a recent teammate obviously Paul

little bit it's a 12-point game here Clinton Grimes leading the Knicks with 22 points Knicks are plus six tonight with Grimes on the floor they've outscored the Celtics by six during his 26 minutes he's been outstanding and Quentin Grimes is showing you know why he has secured that two guard spot for the Knicks you know as a starter and you know defensively he's been asked to guard Jayson Tatum he's given up about four or five inches to Jayson Tatum but he has battled him tooth and nail all night long they will jump it up there's Quentin Grimes I'll tell you he is Type of Guy Tom tiido loves you know never going to really rock the boat in the locker room he's just always going to come in and do his job and he's uh you know he's a late first round draft pick and he has really turned out to

nice little put back there but I'll tell you Kristaps porzingis he doesn't look as as bulky to me it looks like he's lost a little bit of weight he's very lean right now looks very athletic and quick on his feet good ball Movement by the Celtics the three from Horford Celtics lead is back up to 15 here's an experiment by the Celtics playing for Porzingis and Al Horford together they're going to

step behind the ark chase down by Haren Stein seven on the shot clock screen set by hartstein for mride now the return hartstein backs it in nice move K mcpride recognizing that hartenstein got a mismatch on the switch and Isaiah hartenstein doesn't really get those type of opportunities too often but on that play he looked very comfortable and confident catching the ball using his strength great footwork here's the switch and dece McBride throws it up there the double team comes hartenstein splits that double team and you know uses his strength to get that ball up and in the Pride's fifth to ass tonight just committed his third personal foul two minutes in fourth quarter 13-point Boston lead porzingis from three such a pretty stroke such a good looking jump shot a lot of people said why is he standing around the three-point line he's 7' three going inside post up but he has perfected that pick andp game and he does a good job it's tough on big men too who are trained to go back and help as much as possible and protect the rim we talked about Jericho Sims with three block so you know he's trying to protect that Rim but when you're guarding Kristaps SPS Inus you can't leave him for a second cuz he's going to hurt you from Deep here's Pritchard from downtown hord tried to keep it alive it will be Knick Ryan Archie Dio checks back in replacing de McBride sits down

face Charlotte on the road on Thursday before these teams get together a week from tomorrow and the regular season opener Roy committed the foul and the Knicks have a week off after tomorrow's game to prepare for that game that's a long time they're going to have a lot of practice time and you I got to be honest Kenny like only four preseason games that's not a lot to prepare for the season it's a lot of practice time and as a player I'd rather play against opponents than just playing against my teammates all the time and this training camp you know with the new set of rules in the collective baring agreement less preseason games you're doing a lot of practicing against your guys not as much playing games in front of the fans wi has often talked about back in his day Knicks would play around 15 preseason games they would go barnstorming play in neutral SS around the United States y promoting the game too we used to do that up in Minnesota we used to play games in North Dakota uh Montana we used to play our preseason games just to kind of accumulate other fan bases Luke Kornet highlights abound for Luke Kornet flying from the rafters of TD Garden Kornet started 18 games for the Knicks back in the 201819 season Arcidiacono pulls it back out Fournier is fouled by ret with 12 seconds on the clock foul is on number 12 Brissett that's his first team 48 of the line what are some of the positives from a Knick standpoint they'll take out of this game a lot of positives uh Mitchell Robinson continuing to play great basketball and Quentin Grimes getting his shot right you know he struggled a little bit in the first in the preseason so far but having an explosion like this really gives you confidence and just the overall compete level against a really good Celtics team who played a great first half but Knick didn't quit
