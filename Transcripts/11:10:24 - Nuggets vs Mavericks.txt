 with a big D it's a November encounter Arena where it is Military Appreciation Night we're set to honor the troops shoot some hoops with the Denver Nuggets and the Dallas Mavericks Nikola Jokic and his buddy Luka Doncic two of the leading MVP candidates they are in the ring tonight together hi everybody Welcome Chris Marlo Scott Hastings Vic Lombardi will be along shortly well so far so good on the home stand nuggets have won four in a row and if they beat Dallas tonight wouldn't that be the cherry on top it it would be a cherry Mike Rell my old coach always had a goal of winning four out of every five games at home you've done that now it's time to be a little selfish you see what they've done in this home stand I mean their scoring Chris has been off the charts these last four games can they keep it up against Dallas who got better as the season went on defensively if you're talking about Headliners we got them tonight Nikola Jokic of course the three-time MVP and Luka Doncic who would like to be MVP he's been very very close these guys stuffed the stat bucks yeah and listen he's two of the biggest stars in the league by far and only the rebound and assist Jokic leads it he he's done everything he's already had five triple doubles out of the nine games two other games he had 40 points whatever you've asked him to do he's been able to do and he's just been spectacular while doing it LCA Don's really the same type of thing he can flop a foul we know that but this guy can knock it on all three levels he can hit the threes he get the basket you want him to be a facilitator he could be a facilitator and people forget that he's stronger as strong as you you don't realize well after missing three games in concussion protocol Jamal Murray returned with a bank a smashing success 28 points and he was a plus 28 for the team it was as well as I remember Jamal playing maybe in the last year or so you know I he looked like his legs were under him he looked like he spent his time in concussion protocol watching what the team was doing the team's playing faster right now Jamal came back after missing three games said hey you want to play fast I can play fast too and when they do that Murray and Jokic are hard to stop all right just about set ready to go should be a great one the Denver Nuggets and the Dallas Mavericks but first time now to go over to Kyle speller the PA man here at ball arena for as healthiest lives possible and by iata proud local sponsor of the Denver Nuggets download the free app using Code nuggets to start earning cash back on groceries and more today Watson meanwhile for the Dallas Mavericks Luka Doncic with Kyrie Irving might be the best back hord in the league in terms of scoring Naji Marshall Daniel Gafford and Klay Thompson up front all right time to welcome in the third member of our broadcast team it's Vic Lombardi hey Vic fellas how about the job by Christian Braun so far this season first time in his career he's had back-to-back 20po games his numbers across the board have doubled from last year I asked him after the game the other night are you surprising yourself at all with all this offensive production he said no way you play alongside Nikola Jokic you have to score well speaking of that Vic he's tied with Jokic for the team lead in plus minus he is a plus 85 wow so we're just about set ready to go there is head coach Michael Malone he is chasing a legend he's got 430 career wins coaching wins with the Denver Nuggets chasing Doug Mo needs two to tie and three to pass and the great Jason kid a Hall of Famer as a player he had a pretty good coaching career so far guided the Mavs to the Western Conference Finals a year ago 2011 he led the Mavs to an upset win over the Miami Heat very soft spoken I went to his press conference tonight Welly you can barely hear him real quiet but very analytical you one of the things I'm looking for I just realized this walking out Dallas basically playing kind of a three guard offense but Klay Thompson's kind of I I would assume fit in some of that small forward how about him and Porter going at each other tonight two of the great in the NBA Daniel Gafford will jump against nicoa Jokic and we are underway Jokic controls the tap the Nuggets will have the ball to start the fourth quarter officials tonight James Williams TR MX and Brett nansel nuggets five and three overalls Katie mentioned one four in a row and that drops one four in a row and six of their last seven and Jamal Murray right to the glass to start well he's looking for Jokic see he's got his eyes over there eyes over there you see the reach in late cord never really kind of commits to stop him and so he's got that little baby floater so in Jamal's 400th career start he's now made a,1 career threes went over a th000 the other night his free throw is good in the break on top three to nothing meanwhile Dallas missing three key rotation players Dante exom PJ Washington Derek Wiley their backup center all out with various maladies now Doncic turns the corner draws the foul and he'll head to the free throw line very Adept at that well if he feels a reg in and that's what Christian did he's just going to throw it up the basket not a lot of contact but you saw your hand in there one going to be part of the play so hey get some free throws anyway led the league in scoring a year ago the only map to ever do that his free throw is good time now for a live odds update brought to you by FanDuel nugget started as a two-point favorite that's where they are minus 134 on the money line and the total points 233 you think that's about right well if Denver can get 133 and Dallas that'd be perfect nuggets 6 and0 as Scott hings would tell you when they score 120 or more now Y is guarded by Gafford he's a pretty good defensive player Murray turns the corner he's guarded by Naji Marshall Porter's first shot is on the way and good Irving too too short to stop Michael when he cats in in Rhythm like that b in his last five games shooting almost 49% from three-point L had 21 against Miami the other night now the Nuggets double Gap in deep Kyrie Irving who's off to a great start now donon skipping in the corner to Thompson here he comes and Scoops the reverse layup spent 13 Seasons with a Golden State Warriors then coming over to Dallas in a 16 trade now Jokic has it snap it over to Watson Watson trying to save Braun tries to save and does 10 on the shot clock Murray Murray around does who's not a a fabulous defensive player as gaffer gets the Miss and the rebound they'll try to hide Doncic Klay Thompson one of the great three-point Shooters in history now Doncic with the pump fake working against  Peyton Watson that shot is Off the Mark and give it to Christian Braun 63 nuggets Porter three to L jumper B Michael Porter junior playing with great uh confidence averaging 21 points per game in the four game home stand 83 Denver early Kyrie and Kyrie short gafford's got it Corner three Klay Thompson that's no good long rebound Porter's got it snap it up to CB going to ride it home on Doncic and Doncic blocks the shot Watson open here on the near side nobody sees him and Porter instead drives to the bucket and will shoot two did a little it wasn't as slow down your speed like Jokic will do but he still slowed down enough to allow Gafford kind of catch up and run up his back Michael Porter Jr to the line where he shoots 75% fourth time in the last five games with 20 or more points the other game he had 19 against Toronto know slumping out of the gate or slow start if you like last six games he's been humming one more for Michael Porter Jr. sixth year now out of Missouri makes one of two and the Nuggets lead 93 here in the first quarter glad you're with us on altitude a marquee matchup in the NBA tonight Denver and Dallas two Western Conference contenders Thompson fumbles it away Porters got it got numbers snap it to Braun and Braun drops it home not just stayed on his back and Christian cut right in front of him Christian with his first Braunie points of the night he's averaging almost 16 a game Topson underneath the Gafford and that's what Gafford can do for it he doesn't take a shot outside of six Ines yeah he he's got a small range but he's effective in that range 11 to five now nuggets by six hand off bers got another good look that around and out Jokic had the rebound contact ball flies out Kyrie he's got it Kyrie steps back and knocks it in remember the last time the Nuggets played the Mavericks was in Dallas and Kyrie threw in that crazy leftand 15-footer for the win nuggets trying to get free here hand off Murray Murray in Traer put it up in N they're getting physical with him mly ooh that was nearly out of bounds 13-7 now think it's a six-point lead Doncic boobing and weaking takes a long three he's an erratic three-point shooter if you're wondering at 34% streaky waiting for Jokic Jokic playing the facilitator early Braun another strong drive now Jokic in the lane out to pyton Watson he sets he fires he gets the triple his three-point shooting improved from the start of the Season well when he hit that big one late in the game and since then he's been a lot better last couple of games aggregate 26 points on 11 of 20 shooting now Klay Thompson we'll get that he does get that little veteran bump got M Murray off Klay Thompson one of the all-time greats signed a three-year $50 million deal with Dallas Murray's in the lane put it up no tip it it's backand no coming up empty now Kyrie puts on a burst and he missed that but the tip is good give that to Doncic close to being on the cylinder steel Luka is averaging almost 29 per game as the nuggets come up empty and the pass to Gafford he's way Yas looks winded early here 1613 nuggets led by nine at one point at 16-7 nugget won two out of three from Dallas a year ago deviant was that Kyrie Irving game as Kyrie knocks it out of bounds and now a break coming 638 to go first quarter the Denver Nuggets leading by three aren the Nuggets leading here in the first quarter 1613 time out for the whole story presented by Advent H reminding us to keep the spirit going and you look at the Nuggets starters 116 points the other night that's the most in the NBA this year what a night they had Scott field goal percentage three-point percentage and 17 of 19 free throws yeah and the bench actually came back that second half and played better in the second half but you look what they're doing on the season that's that's pretty good and if they continue at that pace that would be a new NBA record for points scored by starters Olivier Max Prosper has come in for the Dallas Mavericks Jokic shoots a three and Nails it Jokic three-point shooting this year has been outstanding at 53% three three consecutive triple doubles the first this year with 30 points in that last game wide open underneath as Powell and Powell is foul so Powell is the backup center now that Derek Lively is out and he will head to the free throw line not a great offensive player but pretty active yeah he and he's been a starter for a number of years for Dallas knows his team kind of turning into a lifer for the Dallas Mavericks there is Lively on the bench as we mentioned Dallas suffering some injuries early Mavs Record 5 and four they are one and one on the road couple of nights from now they go back to Golden State Scott Klay Thompson returns home and that should be a wild Affair up north one more for Powell a pretty good free throw shooter 70% now the nuggets with a ni 18 to 14 lead into Jokic against the undersized Powell pal veteran though knows how to play you because you played against him a bunch corter trying to Corral the basketball going to take a long three and Nails it he had no respect for the de the defender but he just gathered himself and Rose to make that jumper a porter quarter is underway fans nine points for him PJ now Doncic trying to draw the foul instead bangs one in there I wouldn't jump on Luca's three-point shot would you at 34% no and I'm not sure you try not to do it on his two-point shot either cuz he's going to put his chest in you watch Porter shoot this street Chris he's Bobble bobble Bobble watch he just sits I mean he set and gathered nice gather sunk the knees and everything solid gather a sturdy gather see saying take a picture of that one well Porter already with nine three of four couple of Threes Porter going to try it again bam Michael Porter Jr continues his run now 11 here in the first quarter 24-6 Denver Kyrie Irvin had it knocked away pass in side trying to save playay Thompson guarded by Murray five on the clock Thompson shoots over Murray Braun there to try to help no Porter's got it Porter doing a little bit of everything now Jokic will facilitate under to Watson score well he just waited that and got it over the top of the defense fifth assist for Nikola leic here early and the nuggets have their biggest lead of the evening so far 10 points now Kyrie lets it Go and hits Kyrie is a great three-point shooter and a great two-point shooter eight time Allstar he had 29 a couple of nights ago in the lost to Phoenix a heartbreaker the loss by one Porter feeling his oats scrambles into the key and he's going to be fouled by Prosper I'm almost feeling that ir's gotten better as he gotten older shooting three but watch the traffic look at the hands up pals like in that no man's land he didn't really roll to defend anybody Klay was late to get over and how Jer just kind of passed him open should have been a foul on Thompson at the end of that no call a reporter at the line for a couple here of course Friday night the Nuggets LED wired to wire by as many as 26 in a win over Miami as we got some subs coming in Thompson goes out Peyton Watson replaced by Julian Strawther and good numbers for Michael Porter Jr drops it in thought he missed it I think uh they blew the whistle accidentally for violation and then wasn't going to call it and then changed his mind Jason kid up questioning what happened so Julian Strawther who's been playing well he hasn't been shooting well but over overall playing pretty well Spencer Dinwiddie has come on and Dinwiddie is a score former Colorado buff his third season with Dallas after being with the Lakers Christian Braun give it to Jokic Jokic underneath to strawber backhand layups of beauty what a pass well the Nuggets score 30 points already here in the period 342 to go and lead by nine Miss shot Braun has it Russell Westbrook will be in when the ball is dead Strawther around the screen back to Jokic Jokic one-on-one against Powell they're shading Jokic still oneon-one and they pulled the chair on him and he travel that pain pretty good play by pal who knows all the tricks yeah we told you letting him get more physical Jokic and the coach thinking he got bumped a couple of times early and then pal who's played as many games against Jokic as anybody in the Western Conference finally just know listen I can't stop him he just pulled that chair out saw Jamal Murray get replaced by Russell Westbrook Russell Westbook coming off a 10 assist game against Miami six points 10 assist last nugget sub to do that was faku compasso back in 2022 now Kyrie he'll make this in his sleep and he does so you got to have some help on that screen that's a double High screen get a switch and then another quick screen and then boom wide open Westbrook against Dinwiddie West in on Dinwiddie Christian Braun for three that's Off the Mark Powell with the rebound Kyrie Irving so far seven first quarter points loose ball stripped Westbrook's got it Nuggets playing fast down goes genw and Jokic lays it in so there's the play you're talking about a player falls down it's not automatically a foul I I'm watching it right here I mean he didn't even let Jokic hit him right he's like fall before Jokic even turned the post up now Nikola Jokic she explaining the subtleties of officiating then what he hits the deck and Jokic an easy two nugget oh I'm the F brother I heard I heard I'm just making sure everybody know still working hand day oh it's cold in here boy a talkative sword isn't he and Musical and musical sounded like a Brazilian song there oh as Doncic comes up short Christian Braun is on the Run give it to Jokic Jokic A 5.6 assists three rebounds so far Westbrook back to Jokic through the wickets down he goes and someone's going to pick up a foul here Yer diving for that loose ball BR nansel says you can't do it underneath someone's legs so the foul on Jokic his first the third team foul Jaden Hardy has come on for the Dallas Mavericks as we look at Jason kid one of the great players of all time still a nine-point nuggets lead nuggets double and a strong drive to the hoop by Jaden Hardy been filling in for Dante exom who's injured now Jokic guarded by Gafford remember no Lively tonight Jokic the Hub he's doubled oh great pass Westbrook inside missed it Jokic got it on the follow Westbrook the strong Drive Doncic nuggets are Dublin now singled up scler getting his first look at Doncic this season inside of Gafford and Gafford drops it in there pton just kind of let him get too low on that post he saw him and he and he switched out quick enough def a strong guy though M's wide open and around and out got a great look there Doncic length of the Court Strawther there deflecting the steel now Jokic over to Braun dump it into Jokic bad pass now Doncic could to try to roll the foul no dump it in and that'll be no wow there was a Miss of gigantic proportions some crazy basketball scy yeah you could see him looking for Jokic the first Westbrook turnover Jokic gets a foul on just a little behind him don't need to make that pass go yeah let him roll another step there but you see the other guys remember Watson Strawther even Christian Braun havn't played a lot of minutes with Nikola Jokic until right now so it's going to be interesting find okay when at timing where do they want him if I'm on your right side I need to throw it to that left hand absolutely nowhere to throw that ball for the post up Christian Braun is shooting 81% from the free throw line there's been some talk some chatter on X on social that maybe Christian Braun could be considered for most improved player at least through nine games the only Denver Nugget that has ever worn the most improved player was Mahmud Abdul rou back in the day only one nugget now Peyton Watson will guard Doncic moving screen seemed like it Doncic let go wild threee and nobody there to box out that's Russ's guy that's Nai Marshall cruising in he spent his last four seasons with the Pelicans signed a nice deal and Jokic pass deflected Russell goes and gets it westbr going to cast off into Jokic perfect pass yoka shot blocked Watson around the corner put it up short Jokic trying to save and he's out of bounds so Zeke Nnaji is going to get the call Jokic going to get a brief 7.8 rest Watson already with Five Points so Zeke Nnaji comes on scoreless Friday versus Miami and STW out of the game Murr back in Marshall on the dribble gr Marshall has it stripped and it's going to stay with Dallas Denver has a foul to give got to be careful not to give it in the shooting motion though six-point lead for the Nuggets who have only won one two of the nine first quarters they have played this season Doncic A Gifted passer into the corner three on the way that's way short and Murray secures the rebound and that's the end of the first quarter Michael Porter Jr leading the way for the Denver Nuggets with 13 Kyrie had seven to lead the maps you're watching altitude Sports your home for Nuggets basketball UN in creating a healthier tomorrow by King Supers fresh for everyone and by bet 36 5 whatever the moment it's never ordinary at bet 365 we honor the military tonight the troops Denver Nuggets after one quarter of play leading 35 to 29 I'm Chris Marlo with Scott Hastings and Vic Lombardi high scoring first quarter let's bring in vic as we see uh Luka go to the foul line here everybody in that team huddle talking about run let's run guys make us stop and run you'll notice the nuggets are scoring a lot of late cuz their pace of play is up in fact it was a problem last year not this year ninth in the NBA in Pace they're getting out and running well they were 26th last season Vic and that's a huge Improvement of course you have to figure the number one reason is Russell Westbrook and you got Christian Braun who's who's starting playing a lot of minutes he drives the basket Watson gets the baset and Jokic and let's be honest after those first two games of the season their Pace was again wasn't like 28 or 29 so they they have opted starting on that that road trip where they went two two and one and probably could have gone three and0 all right folks we're set for the non Nico Jokic minutes Michael Porter Jr at an outstanding first quarter is back in see how Zeke Nnaji can play with his minutes need in to play B Westbrook three ball in and out and now he sh down of the play by Powell Watson is guarding Doncic he'll take a long three that's good Luka streaky in his seventh Year from Slovenia five time firstam all League player now Westbrook trying to get downhill and threw it away got it back snap it over to Watson and Watson no tip by Westbrook staying with it he's playing with a lot of energy this group have had moments of kind of like who should shoot who should score stolen Westbrook oh he lost the ball off his shoe Hardy dump it under nobody guarding Powell oh what a mess there yeah Zeke went out and double team Doncic on the wing they' already had Strawther or the one Westbrook with na trying to play the two-man game Porter off the screen qu steps back and Porter hits again playing with ultimate confidence this group he has to be just almost perfect 21 against Miami in the win the other night so 3936 nuggets up by three nuggets stay with the double Powell on the weak side and it's blocked nuggets got it I think that was Julian Strawther from my vanish point and the ball thrown away Bo some careless turnovers just easy points too want to play quick you got to know there's got to be somebody in the middle of the paint throwing in there or an easy layup what John Wooden used to say Scout be quick but don't hurry into N and Naji is fouled got P sh when he goes up and dunks it that might be a three-point play maybe so Zeke Nnaji will head to the free throw line Zeke in his fifth year still only 23 years old Scott in the five games that he's played this season the nuggets are four and one and the free throw is no good nuggets as you may know lead the NBA in free throws attempted and free throws made percentage there 77% which is middle of the p Nai misses them both the nuggets come up empty that he still have a one-point lead Luka passs it under the Powell and he is fou Luka you could say Luka has as good a vision as Nico Jokic does when he passes the basketball he sees everything he does he he's gotten away with a couple getting hung up in the air and he just finds Klay Thompson who's always over that left corner so Powell see at the free throw line Al time to straw there what he's saying is when that ball's in the air over there you got to get in front of pal he was late to get there and end up getting a foul they gave him two shots Strawther there's 28th foul this season that leads the Denver Nuggets in most fouls committed we're tied at 39 now doing okay since he came in he's got six points seven points and Dallas has its first lead of the game second team trying to hang on until the starters come back in strugle yes those are his shots right there that that's a designed play from Strawther Julian Strawther a big score at Gonzaga when he was a Youngster now three-pointer on the way short now he trying to secure the re rebound can Westbrook On The Run Westbrook against Klay Thompson left it short Thompson's got it back and Doncic is cherry picking scores it pton went right over the top of it and head coach Michael Malone wants timeout just squandered opportunities by the Denver Nuggets to lengthen their lead Scott and just leaving too many points on the table now Luka avoiding  Peyton and we're tied at 42 13-7 run we are tied at 42 at the moment why we have a second let's give you our beautiful cut of the game presented by Walker MERS manufactured right here in Colorado and Jokic with the dish and straw with a nice cut he was looking one-handed Look Away Strawther knowing Hey listen you're playing that short corner yeah on offense and Jokic in the game Watch The your defensive guy he turns his head get to the basket but he's playing without Aaron Gordon for the second consecutive game think of the third consecutive straw round It Out rebounded by Klay Thompson same play they ran a while ago he had the shot both of them just wide open for Julian option with four points here early Doncic picked up by Westbrook Thompson guarded by Murray shakes off Murray miss it and on the weak side o nuggets are going to get a huge break here yeah I thought that was out on Julian he want to get get the ball and try to get it in Mavs are five and four the nuggets are six and three Westbrook scor it once again the speed and athleticism of Westbrook he just is astounding took Prosper right to the basket didn't he West is 17 year he's 35 years old Dallas scoring again to tie it up at 44 Murray guarded by Don Murray over d off the heel and Thompson comes up with a rebound to Gafford puts it to Gafford just runs from Ren to Ren I mean that that's his path he he wears that wood fors across the NBA how he runs dallis with a lead once again Strawther loose flter no good he quicked it because he saw Gafford in there got to slow his game down just a little bit you saw Dallas already with 32 points in the paint pass underneath good one another score boy Don's passing has been outstanding here his fifth assist he's got 12 points Jokic and Braun ready to come back in this second unit stint to clber yeah hand off Murray Murray's open didn't realize it realizes it misses the shot it's cold here in the second quarter yach Braun standing by and LCA missed one Murray with a strong rebound give it to Westbrook Westbrook Blow by no over to Watson for three Nails it Peyton Watson who three-point shooting is on the upswing and it's one-point game 3 eight for Watson sets some screens the three is no good good rebound on the weak Side by STR on the dribble dri by his man lay it up and in let's see if they count it they do you know the other night they wouldn't have counted that Scott for some reason well he never put the ball on the floor after the whistle and I thought that was the rec re see he's already in his move never put the ball back down and Luka complaining vociferously well I'm going tell it Julie still a young guy but a smart move because and you said a while ago Luc is not the greatest Defender got great hands you got to go that up shoulder and exactly what Julian did got the foul finish Friday night the Nuggets missed just two free throws 17 of 19 tonight they've already missed four well the Nuggets is struggling a little bit at the free throw line to say the least but have a onepoint lead five and a half to go until halftime Jokic back in into Gafford Murray is there see that's too small of a guy to stop to stop that guy seven-footer in in the paint you have to meat him sooner or you just need a bigger guy both bounce under the straw they're back to y got a wide open three and he's been shooting that mud has nicoa Jokic continues to shoot threes at a high Pace two for two tonight 10 points now five rebounds six assists for Jokic on triple double watch always Corner three is on the way that's no good Jokic tapping tapping Prosper with it they strip it but a foul Porter saying you've got got to challenge that he's going to come over and tell Michael Malone I didn't touch him they're looking they're looking they've already used their time out they're going to challenge it well if you're a player Scott Hastings if you're a player and you want to challenge what Michael Porter Jr just did that's the way to do it yeah go to the coach plead your case and then the coach has to trust the Green Lantern is blinking a challenge by the Denver you want me to get him he not going he not going yo watch out watch out P Watch Out P again again again he makes a long pass so now the low manange you got to be in early that pass isn't even there take it away early all right well we're back we are told that the challenge was successful for the Denver Nuggets so they will have one challenge remaining and Murray is fouled he had a shot was worried about Gafford a little bit that challenge Michael got all ball Prosser gets it look that that's ball he raised his other arm up at the end of it but good defense by Michael Klay Thompson was pushed they didn't see it Braun's got it going to Euro he does and he kicks it away but Christian Braun has really become Adept at finishing y obviously with the dunks but with the layups also a 5450 nuggets lead Braun has five points four rebounds in his 13 minutes just over four minutes to go Kyrie Irving again just a little slow coming around that screen for Christian Jokic not all the way out in the face of Kyrie he's got nine Christian Braun Jump ball was a pretty good defensive play by Naji Marshall we're here I'd like to see Jokic get right here to the middle of the ri the rim at the end of it and that way if it would to jump maybe Chris can find him right in front of that Rim see Jokic there see him lean in whisper something I was open yeah no he said I I'll get to the front of the rim next time one of the two Christian Braun will jump against Kyrie Kyrie's got some hops so does Braun Braun bigger and Christian had it but out of Bounce he's slung that thing wow gaffer's got 12 Doncic has 12 for the Mavs Powell with seven Porter with 15 Jokic 10 six and five for close first half to gord it was too high Jokic has it Watson out there Watson coming in and he scores it terrific play by the Denver Nuggets getting out on the break they out scored fast break WI 90 at one time in this quarter tried to come back a little bit nine fast break points for the Nuggets Doncic shrugs off a tackler Dinwiddie seven to shoot Dinwiddie yo-yoing against Murray Murray pretty good defense so far and they throw it out of bounds let's go back to that Jokic assist scottt pretty good stuff well you got to have great passing but you got to have great hands and you got to be able to finish with a guy on your back and that's exactly what happened nuggets on a 124 scoring run and that's going to be a hole this time I think on Marshall it is watch got to have a good pass there it is got to have good hands out in front and then finish under tra in traffic you got to have all three of those that's what happened on that fast break nuggets inbound you mentioned it's a 124 run Porter shoot over Marshall slows it down missed it easiest shot he's missed tonight and one of the only ones he's missed tonight D carries that basketball sure does pass into the corner out to Kyrie Kyrie wow Kyrie scores easily they're getting away with that big push off into the basket NBA allows it but sometimes it looks excessive Murray trying to turn the corner pass it into Jokic boy they're having all kinds of trouble getting the ball to ni Jokic tonight he's mad he's think he's being grabbed now Corner jumper on the way no good and Christian Braun goes and gets it now guys have to be better at rebounding the basketball Murray's in deep puts up a wild shot that's no good he got grabbed too too much a lot of talk l efficience under the Marshall and he lays it in the Nuggets defense which Michael Malone very concerned about the Nuggets defense he's not concerned about the offense they're scoring plenty but the defense has been leaking now Jokic against Gafford Jokic going to go to work he's into the lane bangs into Gafford and they're allowing a little contact as Scott Hastings suggested and gford on his wall they let Gafford get a little body into that turn of the middle and then they let Jokic get away with a little bit of a a bump at the end of it with the Pass that might have been a charge on Jokic so Jokic's got 12 now Kyrie Kyrie got a lot of juice a pretty good defense right there Bing's got 13 now Jokic Porter wide open for three short and Dey standing by Braun is up way tight on Kyrie now they double and Braun with the reach I thought maybe at the start of the season this might be the big challenge for for Christian Braun he can guard bigger guards hard guys like that but what about a little quicker guys yeah got the arm in there you got to go the official did he sweep it did he sweep it but that hand's in there and that just gives you the opportunity second foul on Braun and Kyrie an expert for free throw shooter in the last five seasons straight he shot over 90% in each of them knocks in the first if you're injured no attorney's more qualified to know and to speak about your injuries and the Doctor Who is also a lawyer Dr Joseph Ramos Ramos law.com Dallas Mavericks hanging around doing more than that they have assumed the lead and one more coming for Kyrie Irving they're having a discussion right now whether that was two shots or three Denver point out they thought it was only two the league office is checking that now to see if they can find where that foot was first free throw good see the league office is supposed to be looking at it and the officials James Williams Trey mad they're get they're giving them three was a foot on the line see that foot on the line right there NBA should have all the angles it's not conclusive that Kyrie who hasn't missed a free throw since Hector was a pup knocks in another one a free throw story tonight NS made Seven of Nine the Nuggets five of 10 and you're down by two one more for Kyrie Irving eight time Allstar 29 in the Ws to Phoenix on Friday night a lot of people thinking that that duo wouldn't work subconscious it starting to pay dividends got to the NBA finals last year didn't Murray around the screen Wai for Jokic to cut Jokic has it INE his G more of that please well once you see that switch we've said this on the broadcast a lot you see a switch with a guard you got to find Jokic right away 145 and seven for Jokic 24 seconds remaining in the half once again first B halftime coming up nuggets delayed down the middle Don eyes in the back or the side of his head coach is upset there was a mix up between pton and Michael about how they were going to double not double final six seconds Murray going to take the shot he's got Gafford all away Way short blocks and that is the end of the first half get switch where does the ball go up and down first half 6360 Dallas leads it as we go to the break stick around for the First Bank halftime report ktie wiy and Chris Dey on hand for that Toyota Tacoma it's available now at your Front Range Toyota store nuggets out scored 34 4 to 25 in that second quarter have work to do here in the third but right now it's time to check in with Vic Lombardi and Andrew mson presented by Health one coach you're obviously trying to double Luka and it's causing Mayhem inside they're getting some easy buckets how do you alter those rotations a little bit yeah I mean that's the Fine Line obviously we we're aggressive with Luka so we just got to make sure our rotations are little cleaner and then when we're closing out know who we're closing out to we don't want to get everybody off the three-point line we got to contain a a little bit better Z are you having a little difficulty getting the ball Jokic the right spot uh yeah I think so I think it's just you know taking our time U you know they'll throw different defenses at you but as long as we take our time let him get set and then you know we got to make a good postentry pass which is sometimes a lost start these days go give him Coach mson thank you very much all right thanks fellas Dallas had 42 points in the paint that was the most by a nuggets opponent this season in any half of basketball Dallas did not shoot the three well Scott how do you take advantage of those two numbers well they were they only shot 10 shots in the paint they made seven of them I that's a problem they only got 16 shots so you did some good things but it's like that trying to get as biged as s trying to get the ball in the joke you're not able to do it look shorty going to get it back he tips it over to Watson can Watson help yes he does well Peyton Watson who three-point shooting has improved dramatically I'm telling you since that game he hit kind of that game sealer 13 points for Watson now Klay Thompson wide open around and out now Jokic on the Run Jokic 148 and seven Murray pulls the trigger that's good the Nugget from three-point land have been pretty good having a nine for 17 well there you go see it it it happens so quick and then how fast can you recognize it from the weak side two three Z row Jokic's going to get his own rebound and an assist over to pton Watson who has been three for three I believe from the three-point line tonight and then Murray just kind of pulling up feeling it did not shoot it well in that first half his first make from the three-point line tonight Michael Malone chatting with his fellas Daniel Gafford by the way made all seven shots in that first half I believe all seven were dunks I say the degree of difficulty might have been 1.8 high percentage shots Gafford from Arkansas played a couple of years there but but it's smart he's a big strong kid sets a good screen and all you got to do if you're worried about Kyrie Luka Klay Thompson and all these outside suers just rolled in the rim there you go of course the nuggets without AG yes Aaron Gordon sitting still with the calf issue expected to be out for a while try to keep you posted on that c injures tricky now hand off Murray Murray's got a lane Murray shoves it up and in nice work try to do a little bit more of that we get guys moving off the screen get that offense when you get into half court to move now Kyrie Irving is wide open for three and that's where you pay attention to the roll guys and you got shooter in the far corner what's your suggestion doctor guard them both well either trap the guy right away don't give him an easy pass if that's what you want to do is if it's Luka qu delays under the ground and Braun in the right spot at the right time good play the Nugget back on top 70- 69 Porters got 17 now after a 15-point first half excuse me Christian Braun who had the make he had the seven-point make they'll look at it he got arm after he got ball It's just tough for old school guys to say it's not a foul it's going to be two on Murray yeah I think he gets ball he got ball first and I don't know what the rule is on that it it to me it's a foul cuz he got his arm but he did get the ball first maybe it's how much of the ball did you get but I don't know if you want to challenge that you only have one challenge remaining now Gafford is at the line knocks it in one more for Gafford back in March of 2024 earlier last season made 33 consecutive field goals second most since wils so he's taking a Scott Hastings to you the high percentage shots do do what you do right know what you do do what you do and maybe you foul him a little bit more he hasn't been precise at the free throw line four nugget starters are in double figures Gafford pulls down the rebound Muka give it to Kyrie Kyrie being guarded by Braun most of the night he weaves way in easily the D by a couple Christian Braun they'll give him the three and he'll make him pay so Christian Braun is shooting 50% from three so far early season now gets back on top that that man man just too tough but you can't you can't let a good ball handler choose what side of a screen he wants to go on you've got to keep him on one side of the other back and forth we go round clears y guarded by Doncic his good buddy now Gafford comes wide open is Braun on the weak side so Gafford snuck over guarding Christian Braun and Jokic with eyes in the back of his Serbian head spotted him there it was so Christian Braun now with 12 point so he's had double figures in every single game this season 8 and 1 half to go here in the third nuggets by one before we go to break let's head back up to Chris Dempsey for the interner Mountain Health Sports break Demps 74 lead time out to see who is making a real difference presented by Chipotle well Christian Braun has been a pleasant surprise this season look at the Improvement the shooting the points the three-point percentage is huge getting into the paint doing a little bit of everything and playing good defense too yeah no he he's been special di maybe going through the Zone coming out of there see if Dallas recognizes looks like a one two2 Chris Marlo Scott Hastings Vick Marty got to stop this Dallas attack inside Nai Marshall the Nuggets trying to surround surround down to be here comes Kyrie and Kyrie lays it in Kyrie's hurting the Nuggets well and Gafford just sealed Porter and he couldn't do anything and he might get the shot blocked if he stays on the same side of the rim as the drive he went under the basket Kyrie is as crafty as any guard in the lead absolutely trying to get the back screen and we got Gafford shoving through remember the Mavs are thin at the big man position without Derek Lively who played really well last season all rookie team so two fouls on Gafford two team fouls now Powell will come on and Gafford sits so Jason kid making the sub there talked about Gafford in the pregame presser today really likes the effort the big man gives nuggets uh down by one here Jokic had a roll Murray backing up Murray around the screen Murray takes a two-pointer short Murray there's four for 11 shooting so far tonight Don for three that's no good and sliding in there as Marshall well the Nuggets failed to block out and they're down by three a marshall kind of a all kind of a guy acquired from New Orleans Christian Braun on the L to Jokic that's the place to go it's an easy pick and roll and and if jer's man just slides over it it shouldn't even really be a hesitation Watson guarding Kyrie think it's out of the zone now and Don forces one up and in boy when these two guys are hitting they're tough to stop yeah he get that deep he's so strong you don't realize how strong he really is 67 230 quarter hot early but they slowed him down a little bit going to hand off to Murray hasn't been shooting well yet back to Jokic he's been shoot great and he missed that one got it back up no but he's foul and he may have got his own rebound which I think puts him a triple double 52nd time in his career Chris he's gotten a triple double in the third quarter or sooner Jokic playing a little Slappy ball there and he'll head to the free throw line Jokic a triple double me he's chasing Magic Johnson who has 138 on the alltime list Nikola now at 136 look at the guys that are here tonight Doncic kid Jokic and Westbrook all time that is quite a list as uh we play on here at ball Arena the nuggets and the Dallas Mavericks going back and forth watch out another offensive rebound Kyrie and Kyrie is just he didn't miss those short ones does he he didn't miss the short ones or the long ones Kyrie Irving folks 27 trying to get Michael he thought Michael was the rolling that time CHR Braun in the way puts it up no Y water pull no Braun pop it out Murray Dallas get physical diver's got to find that and get it physically defensively also seven a and Y is fouled by Powell Powell stuck his nose in got hit in the snoot there we mentioned AO Chris at 51 triple doubles before the end of the third quarter in his career the what 36 now do you realize magic and Michael combined only have 49 triple doubles so six triple doubles now this season for Jokic of course he's got the two 40o games as you mentioned Scott he's got the two Sor there's his line the night is young folks going for another monster triple double as Hardy comes on hey fans sign up for bet 365 deposit $10 place a bet for $5 to get your $150 in bonus bets 2 months of streaming on altitude plus but over the moment it's never ordinary at bet 3 365 Jokic drops in two away the last night on my Al altitude plus out there you go have it go get it nuggets are down by one trying to stop Kyrie Irving and difficult na Marshall for that's no good rebound available and Watson's got it pton Watson they played a little point guard as a youngster so he's got fairly decent ball handling skills now trying to set up Porter he got Don on Jokic trying to get there and I don't know how that is not a foul Don was burrowing into the hip of Jokic that's a bit of a ridiculous no call well maybe it's better than it is a no call now Kyrie 8382 nuggets Doncic they're chasing him here he comes putter just reached in grabbed his arm don't miss the ones on Luka the smaller guy arms inside now he's just he's trying to get out of the way but not very many times you not see a guy get C with the foul he's got a hip and he watch Michael he SLA the arm yeah I think that's such a low percentage play for the wing guy that's guarding the thre man outside to just take a slap at him and hope J.R Smith when he was with the Denver I guess he used to drive me crazy when you do that he'd let the three-point shooter wide open reach in whack a foul or he get sucked in and the three-point sh make it through what you want to do almost because you got two bodies flying with Luke anyway yeah you want to hard fake at him almost like a jab Step at him get back hope you can bait him into a pass to the corner I think LC was in his mind he was going to shoot that shot no matter what I think so huh 83 all 5 minutes to go in the third good news Kyrie has gone out for a rest Spencer Dinwiddie has come off Porter straight away fre that's no good Porter had a great first quarter into the start of the second quarter now ders launches a three nugget got there late tip no Porter up high for the rebound he's sixth yage on the run out to Murray Murray in the lane they Flo no good nuggets come up empty but they're going to get the ball back y it's right under the basket and he'll shoot two Michael started that first quarter when he was on fire four of five he's gone since that time just one of five somebody gets a technicle too going to call the foul on Powell his third thir Murray haven't listed who the technical was on yet probably pal also might have been indeed it is on pal so pal getting his money worth and free throws short the nights now nine of 15 at the line this might be a game you do not want to be shooting poorly from the free throw line someone on X said Marlo don't talk about free throw shooting till after okay they missed one they missed one it was after missed another one how's that Jokic shooting up made one made one that's great basketball commentary oh well be a little snarky right now feel a little snarky Powell goes out Gafford is back in I can be snarky I can really do snarky ask my wife Michael Malone in a battle here looking for win number 431 in his coaching career Jaden Hardy has come in wear number one for the G league night he's explosive player 73 games a year ago Jer just told Christian Braun what the play was 8583 crowd kind of quiet at the moment waiting for some explosion to happen for the Denver Nuggets now it's cut off the Baseline that's great defense and Jokic the rebound Jokic leading the NBA in rebounding and assist he's fourth and scoring they get Murray going here it'll be all over y around the corner wide open is stronger nails it bam bam 80 883 temp got a little more physical that last defensive series Strawther guarding Doncic Hardy for three in and out no another rebound to Jokic big man is on his horse so to speak Braun oh and he'll shoot two notice the last two Jokic rebounds Chris he is looking for that long Outlet pass to Christian Braun and and that's the reason why right there he knows Christian gets it in the lane or out in in the break he's going to get out there and get to the rim nearly go look at J he knows had a chance right there to go in for a three-point play Christian knocks one in and timeout taken by Jason kid and the Dallas Mavericks so three 23 to go third quarter Christian Braun and the Nuggets making a push and they lead by Nuggets basketball an altitude Sports brought to you by star lemon lime soda the official soft drink of the Denver Nuggets star hits different by Dan Capas law the official law partner of the Denver Nuggets visit danapis law.com and by Advent Health reminding us to never underestimate the human Spirit on Military Appreciation night hugs all around for our military personnel I'm Chris Marlo with Scott Hastings Vick Lombardi Russell Westbrook has checked in for the Nuggets we're on a bit of a run now they've opened up a six-point lead 8983 kind of coing siding with Kyrie Irving going out of the game for Dallas Denver now that thre minute Mark starting to put some more bench guys in Christian free throw good and Kyrie on the bench watching having a good game 27 points 11 of 13 makes Zone one two2 variety I remember back in the day when Jerry tanian was famous for playing the one 122 at Long Beach State before he went to UNLV and kind of discovered and utilized the amoeba defense we were talking about the other night Scott kind of a uh matchup Zone yeah looked like a Zone looked like a man had principles to vote and and the interesting thing with this one two2 you've got or you had Russell Westbrook Christian Braun and pyton Watson all playing the high positions all three of them aren't afraid to switch out and and guard Luka L tonight 157 and six he's on triple double watch knocked Away by Westbrook well done Westy in the passing Lane so now the the Nuggets can extend their lead with a hoop here under three minutes to go in the third two of the top contenders in the Western Conference Jokic on a slow roll sets up Watson spinner yes Hayton Watson four for four from three-point range and he's got 16 that equals his career high down the middle to Luka and Luka scores and that the Russman a little asleep up high he mad at himself for that one make it 93 to 86 are the numbers for Luka Jokic dump it off Watson oh no he missed that couldn't figure out whether to lay it in the nest like Birdman used to do or dunk it just finish it now Dinwiddie Dinwiddie going to take a three and he knocks it in Spencer Dinwiddie see and that's just it's funny how basketball Cycles like that right you miss a sure thing team comes back and hits a tough three Westbrook for three around and out does the rebound Luka over everybody and the rebound bounces out Al great play weak side in the Nuggets can't come up with the rebound and Luka puts it to bed and the weak side guy stood and just watched the basketball you kind of got three guards and and bton kind of a flex guy not known rebounders but all four need to five straight points for the match after the notes led by seven and Jokic fouled by Gafford Jokic with 24 14 and 13 1 third foul uh handed a note here Jokic averages in his six triple doubles this season so far 25 points 142 rebounds and 14 assists well he may get that tonight no doubt about it Kyrie Irving checks back in with 108 to go time now for the player with a Fearless approach brought to you by New Balance pyton Watson getting some minutes gaining some confidence and putting up numbers Jokic couple of more free throws and there's the 26 average right there on the 14 assist average 15 rebounds more or those to come back in the zone surprised Dallas isn't putting anybody in the middle they just used D to come in there now Corner three didn't we that's no good long rebound Westbrook's got it Westbrook Off to the Races Westbrook give it to ster lay it up no but he's foul and that is the kind of pace that the Nuggets want to play at particularly when they're playing a good defensive team like Dallas I believe Dallas is sixth in defensive rating well anytime that you play a good defensive team if you get a motion you take away that their strength and I'm going to tell you also especially if Jokic get the rebound or it's a long rebound you kick out you you just got we'll get it a b a minute of resting Jokic while he's on the floor Strawther free throw good nuggets bench holding its own against the Dallas bench there's the pace last year uh a pedestrian 26th this season they're at seventh they moved up there Strather makes a couple he made two there we go 9791 now can the Nuggets get a stop they drop back in the one two two now they put Klay Thompson in the middle I think that's a good spot for him Thompson lets it Fly that's good it's a little space but not horrible by pton just a quick shot by Klay 25 109 career threes for Klay Thompson prior to tonight's game sixth on the all time list now Jokic going to shoot a three no going after gaffer wheel into the key oh tried it got deflected yeah good play by Dallas 9 seconds remaining nuggets by three want the screen and roll Watson and Westbrook with a foul I like way Doncic out out M kind of playing with the key is down once Doncic throws in you do not want him to be able to come in and get the ball back nuggets had the foul to give 2.7 remaining trying to get the hands up playay Thompson around the corner and he missed it and that is the end of the third quarter nuggets Trail by three at the half they lead by three as we head to the fourth quarter that was our refreshing re wi presented by Ball Corporation all in for the Nuggets aluminum all in sellout crowd 19,000 strong always one of our favorite nights in the NBA military appreciation night so great to see all the fellas and women in uniform I'm Chris Marlo with Scott Hastings and Vic Lombardi the nuggets out scoring the Mavs by six in that third quarter Char got C with this play about four times this year it's a dribble handoff before he hands off he's got a jump stop instead he just tosses the ball up keeps moving Defender falls down it's a moving screen D Kyrie both in by everybody's up no short with Tap Out Nai Marshall in Murray I guess throwing out the elbow is not not considered a foul anymore Scott we've seen that numerous times tonight not tonight anyway I mean the contact is fine live with but the forearm gets out 9796 as the Nuggets answer back Murray nice three boy the Nuggets can get Murray ramped up he's got 13 five of 13 two of 43s nuggets have made 13 of 24 from Beyond The Arc now Kyrie right back at you Kyrie Irving on that 2016 Cavaliers team with LeBron that upset the Warriors now Westbrook is in the lane no good no offensive rebounders Nikola Jokic out of the game at the moment Kyrie long distance and Michael Malone well I tell you what that was almost Malone hot but that that was near the the circle steeman 10200 Dallas Kyrie Irving is on a heater and the Nuggets find themselves down by two early fourth quarter at ball Arena speaking of Peters some Toyota talk down on the farm Grand Rin goal Jaylen picket how about that corner pocket three for the win three-pointer at the buzzer he had 33 points 12 assists as the goal 37 I ripped him off with four points 372 and six for jayen Picket come on Vic get it right come on goodness what a day congratulations to Jaylen hasn't played much this season getting some seasoning down in the g-league now the Nuggets without Jokic in the game trying to stay even Murray had Nai didn't give it to him having trouble getting away from the Defenders Russell Westbrook in the lane give to Z two three NOP and the rebound to Kyrie Irving so at the top Doncic and Kyrie in there together against the Nuggets reserves challenge for Naji and Luka stepped out of bounds well you got a 69ine guy on you and he's trying to step back to give him a little space to shoot that three didn't realize that Zeke had pushed him that close close to the boundary Porter only with Murray the two starters in Straw's in the lane slipped hard uhoh let's hope he's okay Kyrie nope the bodies are now flying other had a lane and I I don't know just just looked like he skitted here came down awkwardly kind of a weird look on it I tell you that Jaden Hardy has come on for Dallas he wears number one this group just made one field goal since they've been in that was Murray's three Westbrook one of five starting this quarter for this bench group Porter yet to get a shot well it seems to me when Porter's in there that you should try to tailor it with the second team if they're having trouble scoring is that well you got to have motion and you got to have you got to maybe a set play or two but you got to have guys move I think Michael kind of sits there when he's got Russ and and Jamal dribbling the ball he kind of just gets Strawther think he's going to get it second foul on Porter didn't wi he blocked by Porter there you go that's active fabulous defensive play now st's got it ahead to Michael they're playing him pretty tight good screen by Naji Westbrook banging his way in under to Naji puts it away what he's got to do with authority to tie it up at 102y to finish now long range Kyrie again he's on a heater right now three straight threes for Kyrie in this quarter 36 for Kyrie in the game Kyrie Gard Murray Murray around the screen and Murray pass deflected bring Jokic a little early and now nicoa Jokic comes back in and as we say can he restore order well and as he gets up Gafford gets up as well big body to go against big body Kyrie Irving is season high was 35 he's got 36 now career high 60 back in the day now Murray three to shoot Murray turn uncorks one got it that's more like it and the nuggets back to within one that's a you can say it bunny hop in the batch in the P patch 105 104 the turnover there Dallas's first turnover this quarter Dallas the start of a three-game road trip we mentioned Wednesday night they're going to be up at Golden it's going to be Klay Thompson night I to be special boat captain heads boat captain hats that's exactly right I've never seen him wear one of those but here it's entertaining now Murray Jokic is on the perimeter Murray goes oneon-one by Gafford in the lane sets up STW for three in and out Ross is there Porter with the pump fake under oh no Westbrook misses the buunny that's a big Miss nice setup there nuggets could not convert 105 104 Dallas Hardy for three that's no good battle on the weak side Jokic has it he's racing it up over

line is unbelievable 15 of 18 six of six from the three 39 points for Kyrie four threes in this quarter I believe wow now b gets it Jokic Jokic slow rolls it into the key and gets the members bounc 28 15 and 14 for Jokic he's made nine of 15 shots that's not chop liver as my old man used to say we're tied at 108 Luka over the top short Gafford bats it Westbrook's got it can the Nuggets get the lead back here Westbrook on the dribble Drive score broy getting downhill he was mad missing that layup he stay away than now and Westbrook not sure what he's telling staler there he's saying the guy's out

wire here folks just over 5 minutes remaining Watson on Doncic oh official didn't see it but donon stopped playing and grabbed his head he got hit but the official didn't see it Porter got it excuse

Gafford in trouble Gafford underneath Gafford missed it y has it he wants a runner nobody's looking now the Nuggets will set with the two-man game Murray back to Jokic Jokic for three good and a time out this is how you run a pig and roll look how deep Gafford is as open as as NOA will have on a three I mean you have three on the ball at the Block and no one around NOA who just drops that three down well the Serbian fans in the crowd tonight they love their guy they call that troa over in Serbia and we like to say hi to all our Serbian fans they actually get to watch an earlier game I think

7 nothing run in a minute 25 Scott and they are trying to put on the rist let's go over to Vic you mentioned Serbian fans in attendance here's some Serbian fans right here wearing the authentic hats they live in Denver but they're from Serbia it seems like Denver is getting more and more popular with serbians these days fellas I want to correct something I said vic it's 408 a.m. in the morning our fans over there 113 108 nuggets trying to secure win against a really good Dallas team and this will be Nikola going around the corner if you're going to cut off Kyrie you better be out there lateral yeah you got to be square and lateral second foul on Jokic but the fourth team felll now Doncic will inbound he's got 199 and8 and the nuggas get a stop this time down they're looking for Kyrie Kyrie guarded by Murray Kye three into the lane bounces it out Doncic will take the long three got it and right there on him d a good job Murray defending Kye but Doncic gave him you forgot about him for a second nugget wasting a little time there Murray's going to the hoop Jokic great pump fake in the lane and the pass was deflected Doncic is alone Peyton Watson coming from behind can't get there and Dallas ties it up not the time you wanted it right out of the timeout 50 run back to match this game 11 tie of this game Doncic with his 24th Point Murray for three leg it Murray getting a little tired yis with a steal got Christian Braun going to write it in TI Jokic Jokic put it up and in the Jokic Wheeling magic 115 113 both teams huffing and puffing now Gafford dump it under to Marshall and Porter commits the foul you don't there's no way you're going to get that you can't come in that late to give a three-point play up and a timeout called well I'm not sure if you couldn't challenge that Scott might be able to you got time out he laid it in and it's only going to be one shot 308 to go we're tied at 115 time now to take a look at NOA jokic's three-point percentage presented by Advent health first nine Seasons 35% that's about average in the NBA but this season and not bad for a seven-footer 53% and of course Jokic always seems to come back with something a little different although you know he had the Olympics he was he was burdened by that Serbia getting the bronze medal nearly beat the United States in the semifinals so the crowd here at ball Arena hanging around 115 115 nuggets have out scored the Mavs by two here in the period Jokic family there's Nea and straha STR on the left the big fella nea I said it was nail biting time and Nea doing just that course Natalia and Augie wife and daughter Jokic has been spectacular once again 336 and 15 now and Watson Malone tell and Watson go over there D Gafford he want to surround a big guy who's going to take the shooter it's Braun you want to pinch the big guy the two top guys one of those two talk and they get to shoot him so the Nuggets down by one one here Jokic with it Jokic against Gafford and a foul Dallas is in a good foul situation here just Gafford he picks up his fifth but just the is that the is that correct just the first team fou Denver already given Dallas the bonus yeah but gafford's one foul away from saying bye-bye Jokic gets the feed Jokic backing in and Naji Marshall pass it out Murray for to shoot Murray's got a cork one Murray p f throws it up no good he might got fouled and J gets it we're challenge that right away the the foul was called on Luka Doncic but before the play that's no foul nope ball did hit the rim you might get a jump out of it if you're lucky you get a jump or who was in close proximity to the ball this is the key here who has the ball when it comes down where's got lean in challenging the ruing on the floor of a defensive foul that play is under further review I think they're going to win this Murray might want to lean in just a little he didn't get a clean pass over there but somebody ran into him and when they ran into him kind of just took the smoothness out of the play Hey reminder Denver Nuggets basketball and altitude Sports brought to you by star lemon lime soda the official soft drink of the Denver Nuggets star it's different and by Advent Health reminding us to never underestimate the human spirit so it didn't appear that Doncic created contact but as Scott pointed out the ball does eventually hit the rim and which team is closest to it when it comes down oh it'll be Dallas ball cuz Gafford had it so they're taking a look here pretty acrobatic play by Doncic to avoid the foul there yeah that's what I say Murray after review as the defender flies by on the close out he makes illegal contact with the shooter's right elbow the challenge by Dallas is unsuccessful they lose their timeout they lose their challenge it'll be three shots for Jamal Murray we will reset the game clock to 2 minutes and 44 seconds at the time of the foul that is a huge wowser this happened to Dallas the other night in Phoenix when Gafford fouled Yousef nurkic nerkish missed the first free free throw but able to make the second and get a one-point win for the Phoenix Suns did you see the elbowed contact uh it looked like it may have brushed a little bit of Jersey and Luka wasn't a whole lot a huge call there and Murray at the free throw line just one of two tonight you see a season percentage and I think from Murray the second game back from concussion protocol I think good that little review cuz that's almost like having a timeout that gets you an extra minute good for Jokic also yeah absolutely playing a lot of minutes 116 116 second one no good Burke Simpson reminds you that when the game is on the line called 303 790 2525 bur Simpson good lawyers changing lives Murray just one of three there 240 to go we're tied at 116 hug is going to need a little help to secure this win tonight now Kyrie ready to go one-on-one over the top of Watson he is shooting lights out tonight a fabulous game by Kyrie Irving 41 he's made 16 of 19 shots looking at all the Miss free throws ERS had tonight a close game now Jokic with it backing in on GFF gff's got 5,000 quter back to Jokic Jokic in the lane turning twisting and he puts it in 35 now for Jokic 118 118 you want to see a close game on Al dude you got it 152 to go and the Nuggets get a stop they want a double team Kyrie I think
