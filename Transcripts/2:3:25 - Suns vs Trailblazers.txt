 rather than just one or two star players and the ball was popping let's take a look at the for keys to the game DeAndre Ayton had a tremendous game maybe his best overall game against the sun since he's been a Blazer and the Blazers got him involved early on a play like this where he's rolling to the bucket and catching a lob and although this one was in the second half of the game the other night expect the Blazers to try to continue to utilize DA's Powers throughout the game early and then late Devon Booker he's 23 points away from history becoming the son's alltime leading score he had 37 points in the game the other night and he did it efficiently and quickly with a huge third quarter so he will be a key for the Blazers all game long Booker is 23 points away from surpassing the late great Walter Davis of Hall of Famer for the alltime Suns scoring list ahead of Alvin Adams and right behind sweet D Walder Davis when we come back guy with a tremendous touch we all know him as ant Anfernee Simons breaking bread sitting down with Brooke in the interview next for Portland crowd rising to their feet and they beat the Chicago Bulls this a great way to start a road trip Shaedon Sharpe to pass erased by Williams keeps it in play to Avdija he BL out of the boock all the way to the rim to lean up and in power in a right hand slam the Blazers a nice here really happy with the way his ball Club has played over the last couple of ball games just taking care of business so much physicality on both ends that time has the advantage and he PS him in the right hand they've been the best defense in the NBA over the last three games what they've done to Miami to Orlando these teams they can't score against this Blazers lineup up top rock W down the I just think in this league it's all about the spirit of the team you know when your spirit is good and you're playing for your brother next to you on the left and right of you this just incredible what you can do the Blazers and the Hornets a team that's on a roll having won their last three two of them on this road trip rebound gets away from Green R by Avdija here he comes behind the back up the floor into the lane Galloping to the glass and F rolled it up and in four in a row sweep the road trip back to back back Deni Avdija was the star tonight 30 points nine rebounds and a couple of assist and the fifth straight win against an Eastern Conference opponent the Blazers 2 and0 against Orlando this year boy they did it working the like fashion 11990 da congratulations on this dominating one you have won six of your last seven how would you explain this roll you're on is buying in and there's so much fun pick here he comes check the rear view pick Camara race to the rack drive for the glass blocked by eight W by eight winners of seven of their last eight ball games 127 108 final tonight all of a job all right together together together hey man together 3 1 2 3 yes the guy is playing at a very high level s and one over the last eight Anthony how would you describe the brand of basketball you guys are playing right now uh we just uh playing together um you know we all connected on both ends of the floor and uh it's been it's been showing we all been connected playing hard playing for each other and uh it's been coming out good for us in in the win colum you guys have been doing a very good job of getting into the paint has that been a point of emphasis yeah that's been the point emphasis all year um you know just attacking the paint making the defense rotate and you know kicking out for threes and um you know the next action as well so uh you know it's finally starting to come together we starting to get some good chemistry going and um you know finally got everybody healthy and uh you know out there playing you got a win over Phoenix two nights ago how do you do it again tonight uh just uh know kind of with the same aggression um know just any other game we know they're going to come out you know be ultra aggressive today try to you know punch Us in the mouth early um we got to withstand that you obviously they got great players over there and uh we just got to withstand the runs they did I think we did that good last game um you know in the third quarter you know book came out and played well in the third quarter um but we still that and was able to still you know keep the lead so I think today it's going to be in the first quarter instead of the third quarter so um you know we got to be prepared for that thanks s good luck appreciate it it's Portland and Phoenix round two Kevin and Lamar with the lineups and tip it's the Blazers and Suns next Blazers getting set to take on the Phoenix Suns Suns number eight in the west at 25 and 23 the Blazers 20 and 29 12 and 13 here at home you know what they're 4 and a half games out of the final play in spot currently occupied by the Sacramento Kings who roll in here later on this week that's how the fortunes have changed for the Blazers and they've done it with great great defense that we will enumerate a little bit later on in the broadcast take a look at the starting lineup tonight the jumbo package you've got a lot of length and aggression out there starting on the defensive end with tman Camara one of the best Deni Avdija brings that intensity Anfernee Simons the three-point threat Jerami Grant defense in threes and DeAndre Ayton getting double doubles and in the case of Saturday night leading scorer with 24 Four Points Tyus Jones sure handling point guard Kevin Durant you know all about him and Devin Booker 23-point shy breaking the late great Walder Davis's scoring Mark for the all-time leading score in Suns history with Ryan Dunn the promising rookie and Nick Richards the newcomer the seven-footer coming over from Charlotte just a couple of weeks ago Mike buen Holzer in his first season as the Suns head coach extensive career experience a number of years as the lead assistant for Greg Papa in San Antonio and then on his own of course winning a championship in Milwaukee chony bips done an outstanding job with this young basketball team this ball Club right now 12.3 Point differential number one in the NBA over the last eight games that's amazing five of those wins by double figures the scoring a but it's it's about the defense where the Blazers over the last seven games ranked number one in the league and their assignment tonight is of course the great Kevin Durant who in the league and scoring 11 time all NBA still a formidable threat at the age of 36 our officials tonight are Tyler Ford mosa dagger and Shay Flores and we are underway in Portland with the Blazers winning the tip and Anfernee Simons Simons looking to his left up comes obia to get it 10 to shoot an wants some movement Aon will oblig comes out to screen High SS drags Jones down to the far left side jumper off rebound eight swings it outside to Grant he tees up a triple and he got it and there's Jerami Grant shooting 38% from three 20 points in the first match up between these two here at Mota off the offensive rebound defense is around the paint the kick out is available Devin Booker covered by Jamani Camara make 23 hard to get tonight I get a feel little Booker had 15 in quick fashion in the third thir quarter of Saturday night's game on its way to 37 for the contest he can do that Jones Opera off to Dunn tipped Away by granta recovered by dun into the lane flings it up did it catch iron yeah Richards fielded it laid it up and in for twoand dunk Suns on the board some of the Blazers stop playing thought that may be a d they hit iron Discerning eyes all right my eyes deceive me out of the corner stepping up maybe biased knocking it down was Camara with the three and the Blazers lead at 6-2 on the overplays he's got the pick dashing to the rack great start for the Blazers hitting threes and now aggressive on the defensive end yeah the score before I thought it was really unselfish from Manon Simons he had a three-point shot available to him he's the main guy to Blazers want to take an open three but he turned it down to give it to that man right there there to Monty who made the three got the block shot and then he scored in between all that up come the Blazers on this forced possession backing down as Avdija drop steps SP on the Baseline double pump reverse lay it up at Deni Avdija it's a big part of his game that he really looked forward to shown at the NBA level I asked him before the season started Kev what is something that you used to do that maybe we haven't seen a whole lot of as Kevin Durant knocks down to three and then he said his post game he's very confident in it and would expect to have more opportuni is doing that as time goes on Grant sees three dumps it over here to eight ball fakes and then sticks a 15-footer nice Laser's up seven here's a pass it gets away to Booker out of back court and the Blazers already have hurried up the Suns good defense from Deni these Blazers they will pressure you up High they'll Chase and they have defensive anchors each night to man the paint Aon fakes a handoff and actually went downhill with the dribble Drive he'll see him do that a lot could not finish Suns the other way here's a quick pop offered up by Jones it's off long rebound grabbed by the Blazers Deni Avdija up the floor threads his way through and laid it up at in don't they just look a step or two faster than Phoenix oh yeah it looks like the Blazers are the team that lost the other night with the way that they've come out urgent in their approach much more aggressive than the Phoenix Suns here early and Deni Avdija he'll keep the pressure on you as will his teammates Blazers lead it 145 by 2014 Westside Metro's in the house tonight having a ball eating bananas cuz it's all about health and performance and the win on Saturday the Blazers had seven players in double figures balance scoring seems to be leading to wins earlier I asked chy bips how important that has been well I just think it's so dangerous you know when everybody's live like that and everybody's able to be confident and make shots and we pass the ball to the open guy and whoever that open guy is he's confident enough to make a play I just think you you you put any defense at a disadvantage um because usually you're setting up to stop one or two guys and live with the rest or when everybody's Al like that and everybody is able to impact the game you just become very dangerous and guys you know I've been talking with the players and of course the coaching staff over this street and somewhat to what chony said though it really has been coming down to communication the guys talking to each other and that really has been number one in leading to the success that they've been seening yeah thank you Brooke and and plays like that right there the hustle play where tman Camara after the turnover he hustled right down to center of the Court got himself in a position where he could get into a passing Lane and he comes away with with it and then on the previous possession to that Lamar for the Suns a following Jumper by Kevin Durant was affected by the high hands of Jerami Grant who actually blocked one of those fadea away Durant jumpers on Saturday night Avdija comes right back and man is he peppering the sun's here early with nine points yeah and that defensive possession from JG I thought was as good of a defensive possession as you could play on Kevin Durant short of actually blocking the shot he forced Durant to have to change the shot attempt and that just does not happen often Booker into the lane swings over to Jones he's forced into a tough shot Camara was there tamman into front court on the push checked by Ryan dun Ayton comes into the picture from the elbow and knocks it down he has been on a tear himself over the last three ball games 24- n against Phoenix 22 and eight boards against Orlando 21- 14 against Milwaukee Blazers on top here by 14 on a 162 run Booker outside a triple got it he used that screen popped to the top veered off to the side to the open area his first field goal of the night he needs 20 to break Walder Davis's Sun scoring Mark here's Simons with a side adjustment for a triple it's off and Durant with the rebound curling off the screen is Booker picked up on a switch by 814 to shoot Kevin Durant will get it back Booker looks at the clock he sees Aon he dribbles into the lane shredding Defenders and laid it in with the left hand smart of Booker cuz Anfernee Simons was two Booker's right and he went away from that help and drove to the left Avdija backing down isolated on the wing crosscourt whip it comes to Simons trying to work his way by dun faces up puts it between the wickets side steps taunts him with the three attempt instead he'll take it inside and knocks it down on the face he knew where he wanted to go and he knew how he was going to get there with that dribble packet that is Elite lasers up 11 Jones with six minutes gone by here in the quarter Booker a burst of speed he's so strong and then the elevation and that fade got a lot of air under that one he had to work really hard to get that which he's willing to do he's first at a screen to get tman off of him then Deni was denying him out to 40 ft and he eventually got a switch and Anfernee on him so the Blazers will accept that type of sequence rather than an easier score they made him work for it eight on a dribble hand off gets to Simons puts Jones on his hip fadeaway jumpers off Durant a quick Outlet pass sling in as Jones trying to draw Defenders inside Kevin Durant trailing and he splashes in threes two2 from three-point range d BR comes in fifth in the league in scoring just under 27 a game while shooting 40% from three at the far Edge Jerami Grant he wanted to switch against Jones so that he can back him down spacing just was not good enough to allow for that to happen a nice one-on-one play over Richards but dumping up the hook it rattles in and out Durant with a quick burst and Grant trying to beat him to the spot can't foul call on Grant and he calls a foul on the floor and they change it foul on the floor so no shots coming to Kevin Durant Blazers use that dead ball opportunity to send in Sharpe and Scoot Henderson and Simons and Grant will head to the bench scon today is scoot Henderson's 21st birthday I'll wish him a happy birthday yes an interesting young man to get to know coming off of just an outstanding game of 13.9 assists zero turnovers in the win against Phoenix he's been a lot of outstanding look at it looking at his last month of games basically one of the attributes of Booker particularly on the offensive end is his strength and ability to get to the spot he wants to get to to op op yeah FAL in the lineup now Brad deal the long time veteran 13 years out of Florida he defends on Sharpe often comes to scoop for a quick pullup pop Suns check in with the number 10 offense in the league at 115 Grayson Allen of three into the hands of Deni Avdija Deni on the push Richard Retreat off to Sharpe for three got it Shaedon Sharpe Lamar yep with another three and how many games now 30 straight games made at least one wow coming in over the last three Sharpe nine of 18 from three-point range that thing is dial Booker off the screen into a triple yes sir Devin Booker locked in 12 points here in the first quarter well he's that kind of scorer tumman pushed him out to nearly the half court line as he denied the pass good take from Deni turning down the action there was clutter to Deni's left so he chose right T's going to look again to push Devin Booker away from the bucket but Booker has shown that ability and willingness to catch it from that far and still make something happen F will work it inside scoot Henderson discards Grayson Allen says I'm a strong young man but I'm not sure I'm that strong him that far Mason Plumlee along with Royce O'Neale will check in to get Richards and Booker for the Suns Plumley the former blazer for a year and a half ironically traded to Denver for Yusuf Nurkic who is on the bench for the Suns has not played in the last 13 ball games he's dressed tonight and available heal comes off the screen from Plumlee get it back sling in off the dribble and Ayton affected that one with odia helping up the floor scooping over here to scoop bring it back outside scoot taking his time on the screen on the roll it's eaten straightens up and scores mid-range assassin and the steel gives it back to the Blazers go ahead and knock that down Deni Deni get it out battling for the rebound Durant comes out of it with the handle in the front Court where the Blazers await the Suns miscommunication O'Neale looking for Allen curling Allen wasn't even looking at the ball goes right by him and out of bounds turnover and that gives the Suns an opportunity to call a timeout they're going to Stew on their fifth turnover of the night they'll talk about it as Ayton is off to a good start so are the Blazers leading here by eight and heag it has been so solid and makes another pass Rim High to eight here SC outside cat it got it has so solid happy birthday to scoot Henderson tonight's h is on that guy the habet is six as in scoot that's how many games that scoot Henderson has played in his career with at least 10 assists and three three-pointers in that game that is fourth all time in the NBA all time history so when we look at this on film what I want you to see is he's taking advantage of the space that Bradley Beal here is giving him 9.8 ft in Defender distance between scoot Henderson and the defender they're going under this screen and Scoot has taken advantage of that with that open space he's knocking down the three-pointer you know a lot of defenses are are daring scoot Henderson to shoot that shot he's shooting 39.5% on downtown from downtown three-pointers over the last eight games scoot Henderson doing a great job not just Distributing The Rock but also hitting down those open shots big reason why he's fourth all time in 10 assist games and three three-pointer games uh before turning 21 Luca Donis lamelo and try Young that's good company guys oh that's good stuff thank you Tom Suns come the other way with a quick strike after denying kinging at The Rim Donovan kinging in for his first shift of the night Sharpe raises for another three and the rebound to be 154 left first quarter Blazer shooting 60% four of seven from three Suns at 56% and they are four of six from three-point range till Beal gets in the act and he sends in a triple on and I think now the Blazers have the attention of the Phoenix Suns yeah Inside Out play for the Suns anytime Durant has it in or around the paint eyes are going to go that direction just like when scoot has it in the paint you're going to look at him if you help he's going to look throw the lob like the time before and this time he's able to keep it himself keeps Grayson Allen on his siDevin Plumlee and that's some strength right there oh yeah he's got it yeah Grayson Allen a strong lad and so is Mason who met him with pop scoot plays through all that contact for three points and the Blazers up here by six beel is checked by Simons 14 to shoot Grayson Allen picked up in a switch by Grant and that leaves scoot trying to handle Kevin Durant bouncing off to Allen in the corner Royce O'Neale for a triple it's a good job rotating out of that double team Simons up the floor quick move on Durant he'll respond scoop it outside to scoot jaff steps recoils a three is off and Plumley Soares in for the board early look Grant double that leaves Plumley at The Rim he'll hook a Miss but FS it up and in it's a tough double team is kind of going up the lane a little bit and those are always hard to cover for rather than double teams that come from Top down or directly side to side lasers can play two for one here scoot lost it on the way up Allen fans it it's loose fumble gobbles it up sends it ahead to Durant Kevin Durant up the floor there's beel on the L for the jam good F lasers have led by as many as 14 here in the first quarter the Suns come back within two differential of about 3 seconds between the clocks Simons wants to use most of that linoln will come up and Screen he'll roll get it deep lay it up no follow no but a foul this is going to agitate the Suns bench Mike bu neler Donovan Donovan Clingan sh will get two Clingan shooting 73% from the strike 52% from the field and this is 37th game of his rookie year averaging 16 minutes per he is averaging Five Points 6 and A2 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per contest coach phip scanning seeing if he wants to put tumman Camara back in the game coaches assistant coaches always so good at staying on top of things letting him know the scenarios being a head coach there's so many different things you're responsible for that you need the those assistants to be on top of the game as well Donovan missed them both but he gets back down the floor to plug the Gap Beal with a step back professional scorer that was well defended but like you said he is a pro at that1 31 all suns come from 14 back to tide at the end of one here hey fans it's time for tonight's Red Hot Drop from Rip City Clothing tonight only you get 50% off this jacket visit rip city.com c/ Red Hot Drop to check out tonight's exclusive offer those jackets are holding on for their dear lives on Blaze and Doug

getting those two characters into a into a jacket Beal starts things off here in the second the jumper that's off he cap that first quarter comeback by the Suns to tie to 31 after trailing by 14 to the Blazers clinging a high screen trying to Spring Simons and does Booker hanging on for the ride inside on the roll clinging with the catch and a quick tap off the glass up in a yeah once that sun perimeter Defender lost his positioning Mason Plumlee had to step up on aony and there was no backline held behind Mason because he was the backline bad pass intended for Allen gets away Blazers gobble it up but then a crosscourt pass is knocked down by Royce O'Neale the Suns get it right back Booker operating on the Block turns pump fakes three Blazers into the air over to Plumlee on the roll they quickly come over to double him rotate out of it and be a three that's good ball movement that's good trust from Booker make that pass down to Mason who then made a good pass once Deni rotated over the suns are playing together Simons again off the screen kicking it on top here to Avdija Deni Avdija with a triple 14 on the night two of three from three-point range playing together has been a theme for the places s they're coming off the last game with seven guys and double digit scoring 11 assists for Portland on 15 field goals made anony that last time he drove Booker's kind of going to get tripped up a little bit and then Mason Plumlee sees that so then we let it roll he steps up and DC gets the Easy Pass hooker having difficulty getting off the shot and graze the iron he followed it up they rotate out and Grayson out sticks a triple Phoenix seven of 10 three-point range here in the early going number 10 rated offense with number 27 defense the Suns Ross O'Neale's always been a steady Defender he intercepts a pass leading to a be three in transition back tap by O'Neale into the hands of Grayson Allen here's O'Neale checked by Avdija out to Allen pump fake on a drive to the Baseline well defended by Sharpe one to shoot will Booker get it off in time they will not he'll give it up and another turnover to the Suns their seventh of the night it's a good game so far Kev because as you said earlier the Blazers have the sun's full attention this isn't the second of a back to back they've had their rest they're locked in they have their three main Stars playing in this game they got their newly acquired Nick Richards and the Blazers just beat them if the Blazers can beat them again it's it's hard sometimes to measure what's been the best win out of this streak this one to me would be right up there with any other one that's a good point to beat a team like this twice when when they are are loaded and ready for you Allen trying to make a move impeded and a foul obvious first foul team second Suns taking a lead after trailing by 14 in the first quarter of play tied one time in the first quarter here's Booker into the Lane High sweeping hook that's way off and too strong did not hit the rim no reset for to shoot and Grayson Allen will long range and he guides that one up and in Chanty seen enough he calls time suns on top by four hitting the three tonight that has been their theme they're now eight of 12 1.6 Walker to inbound remix with a chance to win the game walker re for the win yes indeed bang bang bang take the L out of lover this

crosscourt to Booker sprays it to Allen his three is off Sharpe is up after the rebound jabbed Away by O'Neale but grabbed by Avdija Dy on the push over to Sharpe into the lane double pump and a foul

three-point range the Blazer shooting 58% from the field these clubs right now got it tied on 7 and a half to go go second gr Jones coming off of Richard streen redirects bouncing to Richards on the road he is sty six to shoot got to put it on the deck and go to work backing in turns on a reverse hangs on the back iron well defended and Aon is there for the rebound Deni Avdija turbo up the floor scoot to eight and he is fouled by Richards more Pace from the blazes resulting in Phoenix not being able to set up their defense the way they like and then getting a defensive foul da to the line the rip city wrapup is your ultimate postgame podcast with Portland Trail Blazers Tyree Smith Danny mang and Joe Simons give you hot takes and Insider insights after the Blazers post game show every night Nate borkin along with Chanty bips saw Roy Rogers a moment ago along the sideline they're in constant motion over there to relay information coaching staff done a real nice job I tell you what yes all of them staying patient staying with it embracing the grind that's what it's all about just embracing the grind the NBA schedule is a grind yes it is things tilting the Blazers away they went seven to the last eight three in a row Grayson Allen with it up top Loops it in the corner cor down goes a sun Durant in the meantime splashes one so because the Blazers were outnumbered on the backline scoot Henderson was in perfect position guarding two by himself and then Deni also on the left side he's guarding two ties Jones and then the shooter in the corner but then he got stuck behind that screen might have been some movement involved oh but that is the challenge over there defensively Richards they say was tamper with the ball as it was in the cylinder the bucket won't count basket interference right there wow that was close really close M score tied at 40 639 to go in the half scoot out of the corner bothered by the close out from Jones centering pass here to Booker Stripped Away tman got a hand in there right behind foul on tman Camara that's the first on tman lasers at the limit Grant will come in with Simons for Portland and Sharpe and obia will depart Rob Williams the third is available for the Blazers tonight has not played in the has three ball games Kevin Durant mid block outside it comes to Booker takes his time gathers himself the three and at Short Grayson Allen the rebound gon Allen wide open S his feet back iron rebound scoot Henderson scoa up the floor downhill hangs ball affected by Richards and then eight there to keep an eye on that ball and swats it in lasers up two Booker zigzag dribble trying to go left cut off nearly lost the dribble got it back powers in Loops it up top to Richards catches lands Works in on a jump hook that is off in the rebound to Ayton that was more good team attention to Devin Booker they're really crowding his path yeah toone raising for three right now Scoot and tumani they'll be the guys that likely will get some of those shots blers just really need one of them to knock some of them down to change the way Phoenix has to defend M on Saturday night 18 that ball got stuck on the hip so that's a car look at tumani chasing Booker All Around Da knows although Devin Booker isn't his primary responsibility he is when there's a screen involved so he gets up there press pressures guys are in the Gap help tumani was setting up to take a charge da gets back after the pass is thrown to then guard Nick Richards that that's what it looks like when coaches talk about multiple efforts and being locked in on the game plan scoot drops it to eight rebound to Kevin Durant and he may have dropped it picked it up here's Booker with it he is Jarred by Camara plays off the contact gets it back contact made by Camara evidently as Booker drops to the floor the foul on tman number two look at right the Blazers were so close to another turnover when Kevin Durant had the ball had he put the ball back on the floor then it would have been illegal action he's okay to drop it and pick it up when it's loose it eventually gets over to Booker and that's a a difficult foul because not only is it against the Blazers most ferocious defender in tumani and they have a few yeah uh but also now Booker who is having no problem scoring getting a chance to score at the line hitting the first and the second on the way is up and in there's a new way to learn about your community that's authentic and relevant Wesley Ogle weekdays on kunp from 7 until a.m. for Ark PDX don't miss the conversation you can be a part of it Booker hitting all three free throws Devin Booker 15 points now now eight shy of breaking Walder Davis's Club record and becoming the sun's alltime leading score tman and Anfernee Simons six to shoot and off the eight in screen intended for Grant knocked down Simons gets it free ball for back court he's going to fling it up there just trying to hit some iron airball grabbed by Mason plumy you don't count ant out from that that shot no he's got a chance well look it it it almost hit the rim or it did hit the rim it was right on some something hit the rim either the rebound from Mason and the referees don't call that a goal tending because they they have to feel like it has a chance to score so yeah we could tell that one wasn't going to go in but he was far off Booker back at the line here's 44 at 16 points he's the League's number eight leading scorer at 25.9 Durant comes in at 26.9 he's number five in the leag blers defense over the last seven games rated number one defensive rating at 106.6 101.6 Avdija will lift off for three Booker drop steps on obia heavy contact they crowd him he's got to get rid of it toal missed the three rebound Aon and again that is community defense bodies yes wow and physical bodies eight put some lumber on on to try to Spring Anfernee Simons instead of kicking back to tumani Camara 28 faces up rebound to Mason Plum something Anfernee Simons did really well in the match up a couple nights ago between these two squads as Kevin Durant extends over Jerami good contest from Jerami is Anthony won that pick and roll matchup C that involved the Sun Center and sometimes he's gone away from it in tonight's game and they've switched to guard to guard as Deni gets fouled here but there's going to be a moment in this game and we know an can do it in a flurry where he is going to be tasked with dominating that matchup and it doesn't mean he has to score every time but he's got to manipulate that matchup because he's the main one that can do it and create something a shot for himself get deep in the paint a shot for a teammate some type of confusion that stresses out the sun's defense being Grant up top this time to set a SC and then Durant his long arms off to Grant defended by Beal instead Eon gets caught out there having to put the ball on the floor which is not his Forte and a turnover if it's not Mason Plumlee or Nick Richards involved Phoenix will gladly switch it eighth turnover on the Blazers and a Timeout on the deck with the Suns leading 4542 and 308 remaining in the second period tonight's Chipotle Difference Maker is Deni Avdija he is a Difference Maker every night really he does so many different things and he does them all at a pretty high level the team doesn't always need it to be at the highest of levels because other guys contribute but when it is up there you see these type of special numbers like we're seeing in this first half with more on obia Tom Ham steps in hello Tom hey KY can trains like freight trains have turbo like turbocharge freight trains cuz that's Deni Avdija in the month of January if you look at the 46 players that had at least 10 drives per game Deni Avdija was second in field goal percentage 64% with uh with drives field goal percentage the only guy with a higher field goal percentage on his driv is Tyrese halberton so that's what we're talking here Deni Avdija second best Drive field goal percentage in the entire NBA guys thank you Tom and that's what we call in the business of segue Tom har a Indiana Pacers in town tomorrow featuring Tyrese Halbert Indiana number four right now in the East here's Simons a three is up and off in the rebound to Plumlee Pacers playing tonight in Utah so it'll be a second of a back toback for them as well tomorrow evening here in Portland Royce O'Neale and Devin Booker bason Plumlee pushing off on Grant to try to Spring Booker off it comes to Royce O'Neale who's a career 38 perer from three down it goes and the Suns leaded by six primarily because they're hitting threes Grant the other way trying to answer in kind can't and the Suns will wheel it out of back court Sun's nine of 17 shooting from three-point range Blazers five of 15 be's been active on the offensive end bouncing over here to Booker Kevin Durant wants it he's checked by Simons he'll get it eight comes over to help and then cutting into the void comes Plumlee a good passer he finds Beal for three Plumlee the rebound Suns on an 80 run have a lead of six hooker with 17 tonight drives it in deep they rotate it again to the hot hand that's Kevin Durant realizing that O'Neale is locked on green right now yeah Devin Booker he's catching the ball so far from the basket that it's it's actually working to the sun's Advantage turbo and one can't see me look now that is a good response for the Blazers wait we're waiting for the music there we go what what's the hold upb if I had a button I I'd hit the button oh you don't have a button I don't have the button this whole time I thought it was you no man there's some things I can't control okay I know you think I'm you know the controller over here I'm not I'm not the all right but on the Suns side Devin Booker catches so far from the bucket then once he splits a gap or beats his man the help from the Blazers is flying from all over the floor good pass oh that was terrific I got to tell you yeah this is that perimeter attack that Devin Booker said when they first acquired Bradley Beal he sees a hard time for teams trying to figure out how to guard against them and it's that kind of play that they envisioned yeah they've put some stuff together since the BL just took a 14-point lead in the first quarter and the onepoint went on a 16-2 run that's when the Suns woke up he leaded here by six 50 seconds left second period Kevin Durant goes to work checked by Grant he has been terrific on Kevin Durant he is double off comes to Plumlee immediately Aon is there guys matching up man for man Anfernee steps up here's a lob intended for Plumlee intercepted by eight give it to Turbo up the floor into the lane over to tman out of the here he comes redirects and lays it up and in he caught the lob in traffic fourpoint Suns lead 24 seconds left second period that last defensive possession for the Blazers was on point every element of it they're going to try to look to duplicate that here Camara stays with Booker up top O'Neale brush screens makes the extra pass to Durant he avoids the oncoming Grant got off the shot in time and hit at a mid-range from the Baseline six-point Suns lead up the floor Deni behind the back right into a Defender Beals got a crack at it one half in the books Suns 55 and the Blazers 49 Deni Avdija leading the Blazers with 12 tonight DeAndre with a dozen there's that defensive possession C that was perfect that ended with the ball in Deni's hands in the middle up to to flying in concentration using that right hand to get it off the glass Devin Booker leading the Suns with 17 halfway through and the Suns lead it 5549 here in Rip City tonight where Brook Olen dam is standing by with Michael Holton to break it all down for you in mere moments here from Portland and Suns on top of the Blazers halfway through bar herd Kevin Calabro Courtside here in Portland see that smile yeah well he's a handsome play that is Brook Olden dams Sun Theo time for the Metro by T-Mobile halime stats Devin Booker 17 points the Suns 10 of 20 from three-point range the Blazers 49% five of 15 from three paint points of 2012 Advantage for the Blazers 2610 bench Advantage for the Suns 11 turnovers 84 the Blazers on the Metro by T-Mobile halftime stats you know the other number that really leaps out is a 135 Second Chance Advantage for the Phoenix Suns it's something the Blazers do extraordinarily well they've done a great job to keep the Blazers off the offensive blast they have the Blazers chasing them around the Blazers are pushing them out far to catch the basketball a lot of times but then as a result and then Devin Booker Bradley Beal driving from 30 plus feet out yanking the help def defense across the court and then when the shot goes up the Blazers are trying to fly around to figure out who to box out so it it has to be dealt with more so on the perimeter than the interior Suns with an 1814 rebound Advantage halfway through or 257 Advantage you should say holding the Blazers in just three offensive rebounds here's Jones at the point off it comes to Kevin Durant covered by Camara Durant on the mid post turns gathers momentum follow away jumper that's way short grab grab by Deni Avdija chops his steps up the floor meets Grant and the wing for a three got it Jerami Grant that's a way to open up this third quarter yes and all coming about because Avdija pushed it into front Court his third assist leads a team with 17 points bounce pass inside eight and right with Nick Richards stride for stride blocks the shot snuffs it and Richards momentum carried the ball out of bounds it'll be Blazer ball Big Time play from da he has to stop the ball handler first and then get back to his man Da sets a hard screen up top for Simons over to Grant going to milk that hot hand off the iron it comes into the outstretched arms of rets K Kevin Durant get separation for three bounding off into the hands of Avdija Durant 10 points tonight two of three from three-point range he's had eight attempts in 20 minutes Ayton will fling uh-uh DeAndre five of 11 12.7 rebounds for him tonight Booker sees a double team coming unloads outside Grant tried to snake a pass inside to Richards that's broken up by Avdija and then Grant took over to beat him out on the floor stumbling after Richards last Touch by the big man Blazer ball Suns Trail the Blazers in the first quarter by 14 and then came back and even it up at 31 at the end of the first quarter Simon sand still often comes to eat he'll raay for three just did make it to the iron Booker will take it Booker 17 tonight six shy breaking Walter Davis's alltime scoring Mark with the sun dun was moving on a screen he commits a foul and another turnover on the Suns normally there should be a spot on offense where you can rest and that normally comes when you don't have the ball in your hand so for Dunn the rookie for Phoenix that's one of those positions you're just setting a screen and getting out of the way yeah that's just kind of routine but tumani doesn't even let you do that incorrectly instead he draws a foul against Avdija with a blow by can't finish eight cleans it up outside to Simons an raises and knocks down his first three of the night Simons five points tonight we tied nonetheless at 55 that speaks to that offense in the distribution lar when your leading scor is five points and you're in a tie ball game yep they just want to set it up for him so that when they need him two potentially close it's right there for the take seven Blazer scores and double figures on Saturday night Durant pork screws into the air he's got a dozen for the night the continues to yo-yo back and forth between these clubs sence elevating done with a rebound down the 28th pick in this year's draft coming out of Virginia that's not a situation he wants to find himself in having to dribble the ball up the floor against tumani play by eight to scramble yep get a hold of that loose ball Jones checked by Simons Booker getting to his spot immediately curls into the lane pump fakes two Defenders into the air and it was Ayton that clipped him so Booker to the line Booker a four-time allar but not this year Des might having a great year eighth in the league and scoring two time all NBA delicious full

broker inching closer to that record 19 points for Booker Walder Davis out of North Carolina Hall of Famer now deceased former Blazer Grant comes the other way and a big jol from Simons that was really good defense from Devin Booker he knew what Deni wanted to do and that's going to be one of the parts of Deni's game that he will have to adjust on depending on who that Defender is Booker that time beat him to the spot Booker is strong enough Defender to take that blow where once the impact happens Den he lost the ball he wasn't able to Corral it and get to his normal side step or just blow by and Deni has taken I I think a perfect approach to that type of thing C where he has said he realizes he's got so much to add to his game he's getting a chance to do things in his career at a high and consistent level that he hasn't gotten a chance to do in the past so he knows it's not all going to come overnight over one season he wants to add little by little Brick by Brick and get to the place where he believes he can be as a player so this is the worst you're likely going to ever see Deni Avdija and that's a pretty good worst it's a rebound that comes right back into his lap up the floor he'll negotiate the top of the arc Tani will take it good cut without the ball Avdija tries to go up but changes his spine to Simons and then they rotate it to Grant and he sticks a three Anfernee Simons did this early in the game he did it again there passed up a potential shot for himself that no one would have got mad at him for taking to give his teammate a look Booker Fade Away Splash Booker with 21 on the night those kind of shots from Booker and Kevin Durant is the reason why the Suns rank last in the league at percentage of overall field goal attempts go get that da overall field goal attempts at The Rim C they live in the mid-range they shoot the second most the second highest percentage of shots from the mid-range at 37.2% and the majority of those are short mid-range they can they can go from three2 Booker has the three and he has the alltime scoring Mark in the history of the Phoenix Suns Booker with 24 tonight Booker in his 10th year out of Kentucky he has seen the lean years and the good years here with the Phoenix Suns Ania comes right back and a triple Blazers with it for 712 to go here in the third quarter and if you had Booker hitting a three out of the corner for the title you probably won that little side parlay here's Booker outside he'll trigger no rebound gathered in by eight Deni Avdija will bring it ahead Avdija hesitates got in deep double pump fake Lay It Up foul dun got it Timeout on the floor Avdija to go to the strike with the Blazers trailing by four 6 and 1 half left in the third quarter congratulations to Devin Booker Phoenix head's alltime leading score 15,6 68 that's quite a list right there yeah 639 left third quarter Sun's on top 6561 here at moda in Portland Oregon USA where're it's now time for the McDonald's MCD delivery replay Anfernee Simons has been primarily a distributor in this game seven assists that leads this game for both teams but the times when he has looked to score he's had to move around quite a bit and no matter how far he's had to travel he's been willing to accept that challenge and he has a shot toward the situation SC well the announcement going out here at Moda about Devin Booker's Good Fortune to being the number one leading scorer in Phoenix Sun's history 10 years working at his craft passing Walder Davis the late great Walder Davis 11 years in the league Walter Davis Hall of Famer two-time all NBA now deceased played for the Blazers for a very short period of time at the end of his career was actually part of the dzen Petrovic deal that sent dzen in a pre team deal to the Nets there he is greeting some of his family in town for the record 37 points on Saturday a 15-point third quarter for Booker satday Adia getting to the line Deni with his second and third free throws tonight I the uh over the last seven games third League free throws attempted three free throws made action here is Kevin Durant coming off the screen Plumlee on the roll barrels into the lane there's not much you can do with that big alligator in that position Sun's on top by four 613 remaining third quarter up top scoot Grant comes off the screen sees traffic hooks it to scooter he'll guide a three up and in it's a really big deal because the way they' regarded him in the first staff they were more so clogging off the paint uh taking away the gaps and forcing them to try to make some shots Booker knifes between Defenders and they attempt to squeeze him and a foul this shot is going to be here for Scoot and he has not been shy about taking it over the last month and it has looked really good leaving his hands foul on a that is the third on Deni ons to the consternation of the crowd here at M tonight good crowd on hand on a Monday the Pacers coming in town tomorrow

Camara will match up on Booker field trying to get in the action Plumlee there to set a screen as well look out scoot they jump the ball feed to Plumlee excellent passer he spots Beal at the rim for the lay yeah that's where shayen has two responsibilities Beal at the rim and then Allen at the three-point line you rather take away to layup first but but also as shade knocks that down with the two you don't want to make it so wide open for Grayson Allen who's one of the top 10 three-point percentage Shooters in the league tough position to be in Sharpe his third attempt of the night on his way to Seven Points Beal watching him is scoop hooker goes to work he draws Ayton on him and immediately goes right at the big man who's vulnerable back penal it's felt like his mindset is he's not going

it come to him he hasn't passed up on any opportunity to attack that's that fine balance that the great scores like him can find an 89 percenter he averages seven attempts a ball game Cashes in on

court where it's himself scoring getting somebody involved and here he is in the open floor he had numbers he had his teammates to his left Anfernee was in that corner area for three and because of those numbers the defense Shades a little bit over there to the point where they can't cut him off directly and he made the right decision got himself to the line and that was after this the crossover

play here at home to Toumani Camara who is that man right there Camara four of five from three 14 points Blazers with a lot of momentum shooting 48% from three for the ball game they won seven of the last Kev I thought this stopp and score from the Blazers led by Deni was impressive we're going to ID Deni he's over here in this area what he's going to do is he's going to point down to tumani in a second to tell tumani to get the corner cuz Deni's going to get the roll we let the play roll and watch Deni go down to help on the roll to the bucket tell tumani you got Corner they sandwich Mason Plumlee get the stop and then they're off and run into a score and before we can even get out of it Donovan Clingan in real time is dunking the ball adding more points to the board so just like that

when he has at least 12 field goal attempts well they're 11 and n Blazer 119 when DeAndre Ayton has at least 12 field goal attempts tonight he has 17 field goal attempts 14 points 12 rebounds and the Blazers are 12 and five when he gets to the free throw line he's got two free throws tonight thank you Tom after the timeout scoot Henderson 13 points on that triple to give the Blazers a lead of four O'Neale closely guarded by scoot over to Grayson Allen on the post up just did get it off in time to pull the Suns to within two Phoenix comes into tonight's play 2523 number eight in the West 10 and

no weak side rebound Grant had position on Beal and a foul on Bradley beal with Anfernee and Deni preparing to check in fourth foul on the Suns in a tie ball game lasers looking for some advantages wherever they can find him yeah that guy right there Anfernee Simons he can create them either out of a screen or just one-onone scoot gets Allen involved in a screen Allen from behind reaches in he puts the Blazers to the line with the reach Allen or Kevin Durant Kevin Durant but Bo I tell you what Allen was taking some some swipes at scoot who steps up to the strike scoot three of three from the line Blazers 13 of 16 tonight from the line he gets it done at the charity strike Anderson 13 points nine assists zero turnover Saturday night against Phoenix he had 23 and seven assists against Orlando the game before that was three of five from three he's strung together some great games mhm 10 and six assists against Milwaukee with just one turnover 96 94 count Blazers a lead of two Blazers not the three offensive players who are going to be the decision makers for the Suns it's just a matter of what method isolation dribble hand hand off ISO has always been an easy answer for Kevin Durant that's what they go to there against the smaller anry SS and this is just the second team foul I believe first team foul for the Blazers oo what an advantage here down the stretch 9694 count Booker one-on-one on Simons trying to force Booker there to help obious steps up recovers on Beal made some contact and they send be to the line in real time I thought that was good defense by both guys Anfernee played really good position defense and that's why no big cre no big Advantage was created on the handoff to B and so because of that coach bips he's going to issue the coach's talents cuz Deni yeah this really seems like marginal contact on this and Deni has the right to be in the restricted area because that's a play that originates in a lower defensive box so this isn't a matter of the foul standing because he standed in that restricted Circle they'll take a look at the Blazer challenge Portland up by two we'll return in a moment kicking off the sixth year of Brooke Hearts your heart continuing to raise funds for the American Heart Association of Oregon and Southwest Washington and 20 members reps of the AHA earlier we got a chance to kind of hang out I was able

lead Booker kick it outside in motion as Beal missed the three rebound Camara well just for the audience rejoining the Blazers lost that coach's Challenge and uh the official felt that tumani slid into the area so again it wasn't a matter of the restricted area cuz he had the ability to stand down there or Deni was the one who slid in Tani's making a three maybe I just felt like tumani was going to make a three had tumani at the top of mine but they said Deni did not get to that spot in time fourth foul on Avdija on that play Camara now comes back down with the triple and he's got a career high in terms of making that three which looks better and better Tani five of seven from three Booker comes back with a long ball no rebound gets away and into the hands of f Kevin Durant up top pump fake a drive finishing with a two-hand jam 9998 Blazers with a lead of one we're under four minutes remaining in this one Tani took a risk defensively going for the steal against Kevin Durant that's not where the Blazers got burned anytime you can get the ball out of Durant's hands and maybe Come Away with a steal that goes the length of the floor you do it scoot had his back Phoenix just stuck with it and got a big bucket Simons a step back three scoop triying to disengage from Allen to race over there and grab the loose ball can't quite get there in time suns will take up with a chance to take the lead six lead changes seven ties in this one Blazers have led by as many as 14 Sun's largest lead has been nine it'll be Bei to bring it out of back court check by Avdija now Simons will switch on to him coming to screen is Durant drawing eight and up top Kevin Durant works the dribble into a pull up got it Kevin Durant is a pullup magician inside the ark both he and Booker yeah another reason the Suns feel so good putting the ball in their hands and going to the mid-range is Phoenix's third best in the league at opponent's blocks per game and here they are blocking the shot yeah Kevin Durant at The Rim there on eight Suns with a one-point lead drop step to the Baseline Booker backing down on Avdija tough cover Avdija at 69 Works him outside Durant slapped Away by scoop recovers into a pass to Allen guns it outside to O'Neale for three uh-uh Ayton tough rebound unloads to Deni speeds down the floor chopping his steps turbo accelerates and he's fouled he got fou a couple times on that one he was determined Fon Booker is his fifth watch him go here comes turbo yeah you can see when he accelerated C it's when he saw that Booker was not close enough to cut off his straight line pathway and as soon as he realized that he just turned it up at another level Avdija of 56 free throws attempted since January the 21st that's seven games ago and that is third only to Shay gildas Alexander with 64 and jannis too with 59 so he's getting the recognition from the officials when he drives the ball the way he does he was red hot in January averaging 18 points eight rebounds and four assists he's got a chance to give the BL lasers a lead here and he does Deni Avdija getting work done again tonight with 24 points seven boards five assists Blazers up one 229 remaining be operating coming off a screen from Durant Kevin Durant will pop out drawing Simons on him again at the top they feel like he can shoot over the top going to go left had some difficulty with the dribble but boy did he get himself right in the air as the Suns take a lead back Durant with 21 tonight so that's that number c the third fewest blocks happen against them the only teams that are better is Milwaukee and the Lakers and then Boston is fourth and what do each of those teams have they got some Superstar players who it is tough to time those guys up and block their shot this is Simons avoiding O'Neale this time but it rattles off into the hands of Durant Booker will bring it up with 141 remaining Suns a lead of one the Blazers do not have the challenge they do have a foul to give Booker into the corner here to Kevin Durant unwind on the three hit the top of the glass side of the glass and it's recovered by the Blazers Simons up the floor you will see that in a rear instance up top it's DeAndre Aon from Simons a pinpoint pass to give the Blazers a lead at 103 102 118 remaining Beal at the point Durant edges his way outside the screen Grant switches out Simons on Durant eight to shoot katd puts a dribble down Fall Away jumper and a foul he will shoot twoo it's hard to block here it is Will Frieza really quick the A's Defender right here Royce O'Neale will let it roll he's staring at the ball cuz he knows Anfernee Simons is dangerous with the ball in his hands in these late game scenarios and then once that happens that's DA's prompt to just get out of

giving the Suns a lead of one lasers next home game tomorrow against the Pacers at seven get your verified Ticket Master tickets at trailblazers.com Pacers on a roll winning tonight against Utah Indiana fourth in the East it's Simons up top working with 11 to shoot 47 seconds to play Blazers down one he's got Kevin Durant on him he steps back a deep two got him he buries a deep two to give the Blazers the lead 105 104 42 seconds remaining in the contest and a Timeout on the deck there was no doubt Simons was taking that shot yeah we talked about it earlier in the game all he needs is is his teammates to give him a chance at the end of the game to then potentially shut the door so the Blazers as a whole they have battled hard Anfernee's been more of a distributor to this point but it gets to a place in the game where they feel like they got a call on their best three-point off the bounce perimeter threat and although Anfernee doesn't get three right there he gets a big two now the conversation shifts to defensively what the Blazers want to accomplish they got to be prepared for a quick Strike Phoenix likely wants to go two for one here two offensive possessions to the Blazers one offensive possession to end this game and so the Blazers have to be communicating early and often let's take a look at a MOA Health assist of the night here tonight then he gets that ball in the middle and he sees tumman he throws it up for him tumman elevates even with some defense right there to finish to play motah Health assist of the game for more information about the motah health assist program visit tra blazers.com Blazers two timeouts remaining both clubs over the limit Suns with one timeout remaining Blazers do not have their challenge 42 seconds remaining Grayson Allen to bring it in bounds Durant will make a move for it initially along the edge he's got eight on him he'll tee up a triple back iron rebound found Avdija that's their two for one that's their quick shot 30 seconds remaining as Avdija clears midt Blazers holding a lead of one they spread the floor three on the left side and tamman in the corner on the right and the Blazers let it work to 21 and 710 seconds remaining 10 on the shot clock and call timeout so this Lamar gives him a chance to take a breather here and set it up with a good healthy portion 10 on the shot clock and be able to use back court as well bringing it in and front Court obia 24 tonight Camara 17 8 and 16 scoot 15 and Simons 11 they had seven in double figures on Saturday night and tonight was another case of excellent distribution now it's about a win Blazers have won three straight seven to the last eight what do you run here one option they'll have they could put Anfernee in the back court and run him into the play late inbounding it to Jerami Grant if they don't want to go that direction since they have enough time it's not an end of game scenario then it's a throw it in Anfernee come off with some type of screen with a roller da being the roller down the paint those are a couple options the latter being one that I can see them running but they got guys on the floor going back to people contributing their scores they got several guys that they can go to in this situation here goes the hand off Sim take it back off to Grant a quick shot it's blocked by damit he got it back three to shoot up he stops for the duck brilliant play by Jerami Grant to give the Blazers a lead of three the sun's on the advance trailing by three Blazers can foul they can foul before the shot goes up here's Booker hook pass to O'Neale over to Allen into the L kick it outside it goes to O'Neale open shooter for the tie got it 1 and 71 seconds remaining and the Blazers use their last timeout they missed two opportunities there the best shot was when Allen drove it into the lane it looked like well first of all they can foul before a shot goes up but beyond that care when this drive happens they should not be leaving the perimeter a two does not beat them in this situation it doesn't hurt him a three-point shots the only shot that can hurt them so you do not want to help off of your man in that scenario the Blazers going to have to draw something up again with right under two seconds they ran a staggered screen on the opposite side for Jerami and when the shot got blocked the defender flew out of the play Kevin Durant continued on behind Jerami now watch tumani down low he's going to carve out space for Jerami to just walk right in there and go up with the dunk so it was a great play offensively by the Blazers to get this done but a blunder defensively that could have kept the advantage on their side and Booker on the advance in front Court flared out he had a chance to foul him there Y and I really thought they were going to get Allen when he drove it into the lane there were three Defenders there around him but they cycle it outside and to his credit Royce O'Neale's had a nice night four of seven shooting from three-point range for a guy whose career averages at 38% all right one and 7 10 seconds for the Blazers yeah keev on this one against a lot of perimeter options anthon's always the first one but watching he slips to the rim and da he's got Royce O'Neale on him the Blazers could run something where they clear out the space and throw it up to him Camara inbounds here Simons he'll turn it's blocked so the Phoenix Suns earn themselves an opportunity at overtime scored tied at 107 here in Portland and another block administered by the Phoenix Suns defense well Bradley Beal didn't get hit no screen for him to really have to navigate so he got a free run up there to block that I thought you see da down there with Royce O'Neale right I thought that's something they might look at where they just clear it out for him and then he has basically two seconds second and a half to catch turn and score we'll step aside and prepare for overtime in Portland time leading score moving just ahead of the late great Walder Davis the Hall of Famer first overtime game of the year for the Blazers looking at the foul situation Simons with five and Avdija with four and for the Suns Devin Booker at the limit of five fouls as well laser send out Avdija and Eon along with Camara Grant and Sim out onto the floor if the Blazers win this tip they will have a possibility to run their La play for da oh they don't get it no they don't in fact Booker is able to grab the loose Rock and sail right to the rim give the Suns the early lead here in overtime Booker 30 tonight at 37 Saturday night Avdija the mental recalibration after you feel like you just let an opportunity slip is always the first thing so the Blazers got to be locked in mentally here gr of three follow tip two hand Jam DeAndre good action somebody running out to the shooter somebody running out to the blockout Blazers had the Suns chasing Durant high screen he'll roll out get it from Beal into the lane on Simons who got to play soft with five fouls tough shot Falling Away Durant giving the Suns to lead a two four minutes remaining in overtime Avdija turns he's got a three in his sights back iron rebound Ayton is after it and it apparently went off of Booker but he wants a challenge he is he basically called the timeout that he did not touch the ball yeah Booker signaled for the timeout he wasn't even waiting for for his coach that's how certain he feels about this so saying was Blazer basketball off of Booker they will contend that and challenge the call now was there a foul proximate to the play Yeah from that angle I'm guessing that Booker with the confidence he showed his hand is on top of DA's so da hits it right there and then Booker like with the camera angle we can't see it the way that he can feel it I don't know what I'm seeing is it go off all right take a look at this one yeah I don't think he I don't think he touched it going off the da that gave you the probably the best look of the three we saw to review the ball last touched Ayton's left hand therefore the challenge is successful it's Phoenix basketball with 24 on the shot clock Phoenix retains their timeout and they have the ability for a second challenge later in the game and remember the Blazers do not have that ability to challenge 111 109 Suns a lead of two 349 remaining in overtime in the Suns to bring it in bouns this tonight when the sun's big three have clicked Booker 32 Durant with 25 and Beal coming off the bench with 21 B will bring it up the floor with a lead of two at 345 to go here in the overtime Royce O'Neale giving to Booker challenged by Camara High hands a three is and into the hands of Grant Simons Motors into front court on a grand screen Durant steps out on him JG has a step advantage and he curls in there with a scoop shot and a little spin on it and rolls in to tie the game at 111 he got there fast dur a screen on the edge Allen floats to the corner Kevin Durant again met by Simons remember playing with five fouls Durant double teed over to O'Neale swings in the corner an open look for Booker no Beal seals off JG for the board and finds the r wide open for three in and out rebound hauled in by Ayton yeah eight and 18 and 16 double double tonight another one Avdija with it Grant looking skip skip forced it into eight turns tough shot Fade Away up and in that's tremendous patience from daf because he was being fronted for a second and Jerami he showed patience as well cuz the skip pass was open but they were intent on getting it down to da8 Durant the other way into the lane bothered by uh by eight and a foul called on da Durant heads to the line a chance to tie it oh Jerami gets to this bucket quick finishes with the layup in here Jerami he's looking at the skip but he saw Royce O'Neale readjust and slide behind da so once that happened now it's a direct post pass down low and the patience from both of those two allow that window to open up Durant looking to put us into a tie situation again with 210 remaining and time the Suns 19 of 22 at the strike Durant an 83 percenter up there hits them both score tied at 113 210 remaining in the OT 14 lead changes 14 ties my oh my Simons checked again by Durant off and CBS to grant grant hard left hand dribble tied up as he goes into the air and a foul as O'Neale reached in fi's going to be called for the slack and in any event Grant has a chance to break this time both teams right now working out of isolation a lot the difference is the Blazers shots are a little bit harder to come by because defensively the Suns aren't sending to it any body right now if Anfernee Simons is involved in the ball screen they're just switching it guard to guard or guard to Wing on the Blazer side they're throwing it to Kevin Durant against Anfernee Simon sometimes and really Kevin Durant against mostly anybody they're going to feel the need to provide some help so that's going to be the challenge this last 150 the fact that the Blazers shots in theory should be harder to generate and he still got to find a way Jerami Grant did right there getting himself to the line and remember that match up Durant on Simons uh is against a guy with five fouls anony Simons grab miss the second free throw eight and priz the rebound away Blazers lead by one and they'll get it back 145 remaining in overtime Simons threading it through the wickets Gathering momentum into the laner running right hander he's fouled on the way to the right yes yes yes good drive another play C oneon-one you got to get your own nobody to help you so you have to call on the skill set that you have worked so hard to develop a couple bounces between the leg a hesitation and then acceleration money time Simons an 89 percenter at the stripe one of the best in the league knocks it down lasers up two and Pops in the second and the Blazers drop back defensively Camara Will Shadow Booker is pinned on a screen Simon steps up on Booker dribble hand off to Durant into the lane ball knocked down by Camara nearly grabbed by Ayton it gets away and out of bounds Suns will take it with 11 on the shot clock tamari with a big time deflection there Suns reconstitute on the inbounds watch this back screen with Booker and Kevin Durant here's book working his way out of the paint up top double team off to O'Neale back to Booker as fresh dribbles in he comes Slants it over to Durant a three at the Buzzard no not only that it Cascades over and out and the Blazers will take it with 113 remaining here Durant two of nine from three-point range tonight Portland lead of three with possession with the pigeon the ball getting stuck up there like that Kevin Durant's last two attempts Phoenix will take that all game long any time of the game practice shots for 104 remaining in overtime Deni working with 12 to shoot they flatten it out now they bring Simons up top Avdija off that screen breaks into the paint jump pass intercepted back down and intercepted Here Comes Brooks up the floor Beal is down at back court they are waiting for him to get himself going Booker comes the other way now Beal joins him 12 to shoot Booker Camara tied up with Allen and a foul on to Mani Camara first in the last minutes so it's a first in the last two the Blazers did have that one to give and Camara just trying to discard Allen and a timeout lasers up three 38 and 610 seconds remaining 14 to shoot for the Suns and they have had some really really good looks let's goad to Tom harro with some clutch notes yeah keeping on Anfernee Simons here as we head to the home stretch here no surprise he hit that big three-pointer with about 42 seconds left in regulation has the two clutch free throws there a second ago Anfernee Simons is fourth in the NBA in clutch scoring per minute that is points per minute in clutch situations he is 1.11 points per minute that's more than a point per minute the only three guys that are more efficient per minute in the clutch situation which is last five minutes game within five Tyrese Maxi Shay gild Alexander and Jaylen Brunson Anfernee Simons is fourth shading Sharpe is 11 and they are only two pairs in the NBA two pairs of teammates one on Cleveland and one on Portland how about that it's good stuff thank you Tom so what are the odds and Anfernee Simons going to see the ball in his hands a few times Suns will bring it in bounds 14 to shoot 38 and 610 seconds remaining Blazers two timeouts remaining same thing I said in regulation C two for one Phoenix wants to get this shot up as quickly as possible Durant checked by Avdija in he comes double team to fi sneaks along the in line to lay it in and the Blazers call time Portland with possession leading by one calling time time out 32 and 610 seconds remaining in the overtime Blazers had a three-point lead in regulation when Royce O'Neale busted a triple after the Blazers with an opportunity to foul did not and here we are in overtime so with a timeout remaining both sides Lamar both teams going to the free throw line what do you what do you see here Blazers they should add without the challenge and the Suns do have one remaining Blazers can take their time on this situation they don't have to go two for one it's not a tie game they're not losing uh their advantage is the the score and time right now so they can utilize clock and Anfernee Simons will will likely have a say in this but what that say is remains to be seen because like we saw at the end of regulation they drew a play up where Anfernee and da were on one side on the left side and they ran a a stagger on the opposite side for Jerami so that goes back to them coming off of a game with seven guys in double digit scoring the way they've been winning by committee they feel really comfortable kind of putting the ball in the hands of several guys mainly Anfernee Jerami Deni off of some movement but more times than not Anfernee Simons will have an imprint in whatever happens on this play and now with the big in the game c as Mason Plumlee in that's a big to Target in a screen roll game that just won't switch and feel comfortable in doing that so let's see if the Blazers can go Expos that 14 seconds to shoot Simons across midcourt he is covered by Bei a quick move with the left hand stop pop well Off the Mark did not hit the rim no reset four and 51 seconds remaining hold on they want to check and see did it hit the Rim Yeah it hit the rim all right they did not re set the shot clock now correct or incorrect so as they look at this did you see what the Blazers did they did similar action that they did when they played at Milwaukee this year they bring the two screens up and then move them out the way to clear the open for the middle open for Anfernee the the thing is on this situation they could have been yet doesn't touch no doesn't look like it in that situation K because bason Plumlee was on the floor they actually could have gone screen roll and generated offense with that as they normally do but Plumlee hadn't been in the game for a long stretch of time so they they drew up a play based on how the flow the game had been going so that's a good sub for Mike buenos to give a a different look and they try to open up that middle for Anfernee to get a one-on-one shot in Milwaukee it resulted in him getting an and one bucket that was the go-ahead bucket to get the win this time the Suns defended fairly well this actually works to the Blazers Advantage cuz they get a free timeout essentially here to reset with 4 and 510 seconds remaining yes but also did you see whose hands it was in when the whistle blew at the top of the key ball bouncing back out to him Anfernee Portland will inbound the ball with 13 on the shot clock so even better wow even better it's getting better and better oh wait a minute you say they're turning the shot clock off or they talking about the game clock he just said shot clock yeah he said no four and five 10 seconds on the shot clock 13 the I thought I heard him say shot clock I was going to say but but ke when they blew the whistle anony had the ball in his hands at the top of the key so if they played that through he would have got an open three at the top but game moves on so what do you see here well I see anthon or Jerami uh coming off of the screen here uh ant might Maybe you know what they could do they could uh run anony down and then he can curl around and JG and da can essentially set a a double screen for anony to run to the top to get this ball four P four point five on a shot clock Abby to bring it in bounds checked by O'Neale Aon at the elbow near the ball Grant down on the Baseline now more consternation Okay Tyler for just a one we to make sure we're all framed up all on the same page here getting it settled for Avdija to bring a ball in bounds there it is Jerami Curt around to get it to INF eight on the far side Grant moving toward the edge denied by Durant tipped It Out 3 and 810 seconds remaining on the shot clock yeah Deni wasn't able to get it in the a after he came off with that screen Avdija again to bring it in bounds Simon working toward it Grant's got it he'll heave the three it's up off the back iron Ayton races after the rebound reloads to Jerami Grant and a foul called on the floor 7even and 810 seconds remaining how about that and Ayton heading to the line with the Blazers leading here 116 115 eight to 61% Center at the line 53 of 73 all of this year pumps it up caught some iron off the glass and in Suns a timeout remaining Blazers a timeout remaining Portland a lead of two Avdija and Camara across from one another in the lane O'Neale and Durant down on those Baseline positions here's the shot up and good and the Blazers lead it by three 7 and 8 10 seconds remaining Beal will advance quick foul Deni Avdija comes to get him that was a quick one but it s Fiel to the line for two with a Blazer still holding a lead of three yeah they could have run a a few more seconds off the clock but they were hypens after what happened last time absolutely Mike benen hoser almost looked I don't know if you saw his reaction almost disappointed that his crew got fouled so early almost like he didn't expect it I I don't know for certain Kev but he did not look like that was something he was expecting now they do have a timeout remaining so they don't need to intentionally miss this does Phoenix Blazers bolster their position inside with Clingan stepping in now and igodo the 610 rookie for Marquette will step in now for the Suns to align there with Avdija and eight Bradley Beal hits to here the Blazers call time yeah so now the Blazers get to draw up a play to get the ball into whoever they want to shoot the free throws nothing about this play is about scoring that's lowest on the totem pole in priorities they want to get it in and know that Phoenix has to foul or try to tie you up go for a strip so what coach bips and his staff is selling the scene don't just have the ball inbounded and expose it be strong with it expect foul and play for a foul you do not need to shoot the basketball do they have enough time the Suns though to to go for a strip or or try to a tie up it seems like they've got a foul immediately with five and 9 10 seconds as a Defender you know that answer upon approach because upon approach when you're seeing that offensive player grab the ball you can tell what he's planning on doing with the ball is he planning on getting it and curling up cuz if so yeah I got I got I got a chance yeah no no no no I'm saying if he's curling up got to I got a chance to tie him up okay I got you you see what I'm saying but if it's I can B upon approach he's catching this ball in Triple Threat he's strong he's trying to advance I got to follow I'm not going to get no action out of this and I would presume you'd want the hand ball in the hands of a guy it's an 89 percenter in Anfernee Simons yeah so that's and then the next option Jerami Grant so that's why these two guys are on the front court side of the court to give them as much space as they need back here to work together and get open Camara will bring it in bounce maneuvering to it Simons double team they swing it into back court it's grabbed by Eon and he's immediately fouled by Ryan dun stops the clock with five and five 10 seconds remaining and it sends Ayton again to the free throw line where as we mentioned a moment ago a 61 percenter but boys hit a couple of clutch already here tonight Blazers up one Suns do have the timeout remaining Blazers with none this actually is exactly what the Suns wanted I would think four10 of a second work off the clock and you get it into the hands of the worst free throw shooter and you immediately foul here's Aon at the line knocks it down that is just money right there yeah and this is exactly what da wanted a chance to potentially cap the win against his former team 23 and 19 board tonight for DeAndre eight in 42 minutes of f work five of five from the line great rotation on that one there was no doubt about that one 120 117 Blazers up three 5 and 510 seconds remaining in the overtime both teams out of timeouts there was a time two or three seasons ago when DeAndre Ayton on that opposite B basket played for the Suns and had a chance that's right to make game ceiling free throws for the Suns to win and he missed he had a voice in his ear had a voice in his ear and then Anfernee Simons came down the next play and had a run and jump hook against Mel Bridges that was a beauty and so now the tables have turned for da where he's back at that line in the same Arena different team different basket and different result eight as we mentioned was a jumbo effort 19 boards for starters activity when he's active everybody can see it right away because it makes impact it registers in the box scores it frustrates opponents because of his frame his speed his agility not giving up on stuff he can get to certain rebounds that are out of area that not every Center in the league can get to and that's why teammates really appreciate this effort from them where's Phoenix going with this one Kevin Durant or Booker they make the most sense but also Bradley ve is not a bad option the question is where are the Blazers going with this are they fouling before the shot goes off Allen to bring it in bounds maneuvering to it is Booker his shot is up he is fouled in the act and he was shooting a three oh he took a slap at it he was off balance the couldn't check himself if he had hit him on this first lap right there it would be a non- shooting foul because the upward shooting motion had not begun he just missed on the first lap and he is fouled out to compound matters so Booker a chance to tie the game both teams out of timeouts 4 and 410 seconds remaining Booker tonight 11 of 11 from the strike an 89% free throw shooter on the year Devin Booker who has become the Phoenix son's all-time leading scorer just P the late great Walter Davis tonight if he makes both of these with no timeout the Blazers don't have the speed of Deni Avdija to race the ball up the floor it's got to be somebody else scooter aery so now Mike bher sends in the rookie defensive Ace done for Mason Plumlee so they can match everything up on the perimeter O'Neale will come in for Allen and here's Booker with a chance to tie the game at overtime 4 and 41 seconds remaining missed it rebound Ayton is 20th of the night and a foul with three and two 10 seconds remaining Booker misses the free throw the Blazers maintain the lead and Aon again is called upon to head to the line so now Booker doing what I just said da did a couple seasons ago on this very basket missing a free throw that they needed sorely and da has a chance now to add to the total Booker H 13 in a row prior to that Miss eight and six for six 24 points 20 rebounds against the Phoenix Suns and he pumps in the first of two here to get the blaz there's a lead of two at this point Phoenix wants the Blazers likely to make this cuz it gives them a chance to take the ball out get set run down the floor get favorable positioning regardless on a maker Miss they're likely going to get a three off here pton missing the free throw ball jabbed it's grabbed by Grant grabbed by Grant secured by Grant game over Blazers wi at21 1119 in overtime behind DeAndre Ayton they didn't even get a shot off after getting the missed free throw they needed because of more Blazer activity that has been alive and well throughout this entire win streak going on four straight winds and the Blazers wi eight of their last nine with a victory here tonight in overtime against the Suns and the sweep of the two game series against the Phoenix Suns as they spent three days here in Portland 121 119 eting a big night tonight 25 and 20 Deni Avdija at 24 before fouling out with eight boards and five assists Brooke is working her way toward an interview out on the court and you can imagine the Blazers celebrating here right now enjoying themselves and they should terrific effort tonight turned in by the Blazers let's send it down to Brook H and down right as da came over he said that's what we do right that's what we do

down and being pories in the end I thank God I you know made all my freeos in the end I just you know just kept uh putting pressure on the glass and my teammates just finding me tonight speaking of the biggest plays tonight were your offensive rebounds was that your focus most definitely you know um they had a small line up in to make us work but you know when shot go up on our end I had a chance you know just to really Chase these boys and just secure possessions to make us have daggers and know put us in good positions to end I'm so proud of you nice job and you get to do this again yeah I I got the only Blazer to do it twice so far nicely done nailed it great job tonight the Baseline report was brought to you by bright side windows the official Windows partner of your Portland Trailblazers thank Brook it's the fourth 2020 of his career for DeAndre Ayton 25 points 20 rebounds 7 of eight from the line and the one that he missed well that was crucial too as the Blazers get possession on the Miss to seal the deal one21 119 in overtime Blazers go to 21 and 29 on the year Suns go to 2524 on the season we'll come back to break it all down for you in a moment from Portland
