 Doc Rivers this is literally just the ninth time since doc took over his head coach that he has all three at his disposal they've got so Much Chemistry late game execution starting lineup Derrick white finds Horford Tatum gets a good clean look his first shot knocks down the three and that was just a mistake right there by the Bucks they're not sure who's matched up with who Giannis is pointing to Derrick white telling Brook Lopez to take him and that allows for an easy transition nice defense from forf for last Touch by the veteran yeah three white jerseys standing in the paint staring at one another as the Boston Celtics are filling to the three-point line well this is where their defense has really struggled this season in particular the recent stretch the defense much improved as is ao's jump shot this year but misses on his first one Buck just three and six on the road Celtics of course have won nine of 11 games at home including their last six Derrick white way off on the three and atic hoop with a rebound Jaylen Brown guarding him Giannis putting up those staggering numbers once again here in his 12th year in the NBA Lillard from way outside and the ball hit the wire so Celtics get it back okay Richard how many guys can do what Jaylen Brown just did did absorb those sort of punishing hits that Giannis wants to put on you inside that free throw line and keep attached to him defensively not many perimeter Wing players there are some bigs that have the ability but I would say there's five to seven players that can do it for a short period of time not for an entire 48 minutes Giannis needs an entire wall great defense from Jackson comes up with a steal Prince down the other end finds a Giannis throws it down the young Jackson an excellent defensive player again still getting the start Middleton will come off the bench Lillard picks up Jaylen brown Brown's had some huge first quarters recently including the other night when Tatum didn't play he knocks down his first shot and you see they brought Damian Lillard into that pick and roll Derrick white brings him in because that's the one-on-one matchup that they want to either force a shot Force help or get a good shot Jaylen Brown tough shot over good defense pass inside shot blocked holl they got a piece of it and white comes away Brown had 15 points in the first quarter on Wednesday he's got four points in the first two minutes plus here on Friday well that first step that first is just fun to watch and it also helps when you got a big on you that that first step gets a little bit stronger when you got a big now Brook is great at blocking shots but that at a right the basket's tough Lillard using the screen and now is the three-pointer he's on a great stretch shooting the ball not just putting up scoring numbers but efficiently holiday this the third game of a five-game home stand for Boston they've won the first two as Antetokounmpo is fouled on the entry pass holiday picks up his first and we talked about bringing Damian in the pick and roll look they're patient Derrick white knows that if Damian's guarding him that's what they're going to do they're going to switch now that's when Jaylen Brown gets aggressive this is great defense by Damian bigger bigger driving at a big when he gets you is that there typically isn't another big yes they have Giannis but that would force a collapse and get you a good shot on the open ball Finds Its way all the way out to Jackson his little floaters is up and good Jackson is not good a big time score but he's been a big help for Doc Rivers this is his 13th start of the Season white alluding Lillard and a reaching foul on Lopez rivers of course the former head coach of the Boston Celtics 2008 championship team you know you think back on in 2008 so they win the title the next year after the title they start 27-2 it wasn't until Kevin Garnett got injured that things started to go I wouldn't say South they still won a ton of games but as kadum knocks down the three that's why it's so impressive what Boston's doing 18 and4 out they're playing with the same hunger they are and and having everybody Step Up Jackson lost it white comes up with it brown likes this match spins hangs on to the ball holiday back to Brown six fires three-pointer got it and a quick time out for well Damian Lillard very difficult to handle steps back knocks down to three his second three-pointer holiday up top to White Prince coming to help now it's brown against the young Jackson and a defense defense of 3 seconds that was called by Cassell seconds before the official signal it Doc Rivers and that's his former assistant Sam's getting a kick out of that well and if you're Giannis if you're Giannis you're right next to their bench you hear Cassel his unmistakable voice screaming last three just to step out well Tatum who's shooting 80% from line this is the one shot technical s cassos has always been one of my favorite players to watch I don't know if there's a player that enjoyed playing basketball more than S Cel no he he left New Jersey right after I got there and every player just raved about playing with him and the confidence that he gave White had it Pok away gets it back kicks it out holiday likes that corner three he's missed first two tonight and miss his last two games right now on Lillard that's a fun match up Lillard finding some room can't get that to fall another three-pointer another one goes down and brown once again in double figures early in the first quarter one of the things that Milwaukee struggled with when they got out the gates 2 and eight was transition defense you better be running to three on the defensive end if you're playing the Boston Celtics they lead and makes and attempts from three and a lot of them come in transition that wasn't even transition Doris that was just lazy half court offense jogging back not looking up pass Pass open shot for the best shooting team in basketball Brown tries again twoo strong Jackson the rebound pushing it up Giannis has taken so far three shots kicks it out to Lillard Tatum on the ball the move Tatum stays with him the strength of the pedo and a foul on the floor before the shot Tatum not not as much they would call drop three you knew the play was coming because they were going to make a decision I'm either going to have to play hard defense or potentially get a second foul so that just puts the the the team in pressure they don't always go right back at that same play and here's Middleton his first minutes of the Season what a great sight from Middleton and for the Milwaukee Bucks as Theo misses that jumper holiday drives on Giannis Payton Pritchard the six-man extraordinaire with his first minutes tonight holiday goes down low lays it up and in paint wide open that time Boston that's what they do Mike they just spread you out and it opens driving lanes and they really get you going how about Jaylen Brown's defense Lillard thought there should have been a foul there was some contact but the officials have been letting them play with perimeter defense a lot going to both pass Jackson couldn't handle and that's a second turnover for the buks and watch this defense look you loving that energy and then pyton prer comes in and does the exact same thing this is a team identity did you see Lillard's stare at the official after he fell down and passed the ball feeling Brown was a little too handsy there well they're going to get a lot of opportunities at it because you said I love to see players take the challenge when other superstars are we're not going to let you walk it up we're going to pick you up at the three-point line take two or three seconds off of the shot clock that adds up over the course of the game you're seeing that happen more and more across the NBA teams pushing up trying to dwindle that clock Sam Hauser in for the first time for the Celtics another important part of their bench Brown Turn shoots SC already 12 points in 6 and A2 minutes for Jaylen Brown he's five of six from the field but they are making Damian Lillard guard every single defensive possession and now putting all kinds of pressure on him when he comes down this end of the floor Middleton throws it up that was a shot Pritchard releases nice Outlet Hauser goes behind the back the Pritchard good transition defense for the bucks and pitcher can't hit it just what you guys were talking about that's what the Bucks want to see in transition Middleton count it and a foul how about Middleton his first shot of the seat make that his second shot of the season and a chance for this is what Khris Middleton does so well look he's got the size he's about 6' 7 can Elevate and his understanding of the game is something that I don't think he nearly got enough credit for cuz he makes the right decisions at the right time had left ankle surgery in May right ankle surgery in June and clearly missed the first 21 games he's now 33 years old his 13th year in the league obviously a critical part of their championship in 2021 but he's had to deal with a lot of injuries since then High arcing three and AJ Green who just checked in the rebound hon Obby Portis also in Horford daring the Antetokounmpo to shoot he rattles it in Mike you touched on this you look at the mid-range numbers from Giannis Antetokounmpo that jumper is working in a lot of two-pointers he's not shooting many threes this year and those numbers way down three-point attempts Richard want to get a shot off Giannis comes out and make a tough good defense here Richard A contested three Lillard got a piece that's great buck defense well if you're going to get people going at you every starts every play down you have to make a stand that's good defense but like you said they're going at at Damian every play and it's Antetokounmpo got fouled so he'll go to the free throw line well he's coming off a game where he lived at the free throw line This is where he has been absolutely special and he talked about this a few days ago he said I'm getting older just crossed the 30 barrier he said yes I'm dominant in the pain I'm over 20 points per game but I take a physical beating and because of the longevity I want to step out and become more dangerous well you mentioned it Doris the other night in a loss to Atlanta Wednesday he took 26 free throw attempts it's not a career high most he's taken in the game is 32 Tom SS that when he hit 15 of 26 the other too excited right what up how you doing how about these oh no not bad yeah right not oh my goodness does anyone see that Doc Rivers what he talks about Lopez says Sunshine every day he's just in such a a positive mindset as holiday fires away and knocks down not three-pointer already now they in the first quarter five threes for the Celtics and that's important because when the Celtics hit 23s they are 9 and0 they do not lose they've actually hit 23s 24 times over the past two years double any other team so guarding the three-point we talk about it but it is an actual number that they have to stop and Middleton knocks that down well the three-point shooting they've hit it nine times this year they're nine and0 as Jaylen brown has Portis on him just under the three minute mark Oh Long three-pointer it's the front of the rim in the history of the Celtics when they've hit 23s they're 54 and five should get to 23s if you're the Celtics ptis can't get that to go Horford the rebound Hauser no hesitation Nails the six three-pointer in the first quarter and that's transition defense people make it seem like transition defense is just getting a dunk or getting a layup is not getting your defense set a miss and a simple open three Gary Trent with an open three Trent who struggled early shooting has really come on recently he's one of their few additions this year Doris and Milwaukee it's been an important part of this quality stretch of wins Damian Lillard good start for him tonight Hauser by the way coming off a 20p point game the other night he got the start his second start of the season with Tatum Al Ali go shanis couldn't quite control it quick Outlet Pritchard throws it again to Hauser Hauser chips it to Brown good hustle play from Sam Hauser Pritchard lines that one up needless to say Richard has become a fan and favorite to say the least I had the opportunity to call some of his games when he was at Oregon and I was calling Pack 12 games and he was more of a traditional point guard as you see Portis with the post up he was more of a traditional point guard get his guys set up score when needed but for this role he's energy off the B and high Lev defense I love to see how he's adjusted his game year over year I looking for an opening Bobby Portis on him has a little room and has another three seven already here in the first quarter but the buck only down by four as we hit the one minute Mark Bucks have hit four there six from downtown easy two- corter for Giannis eight points for Giannis here in the opening period offensively the bucks even with Middleton in his first game there's just such a better flow he's a smart basketball player Mike and he can play with and without the basketball we've seen his mid-range already his three already shot clock winding down Jaylen Brown in the paint shot too strong Portis has it both teams shooting 47% from the field here in the first quarter but shooting well from three-point range Celtics 16 of their 23 shots from downtown AJ Green Top 10 in the NBA in three-pointers Outlet stolen by Middleton floats it up shot won't go quter TI and that ends the first quarter first game I just want him to get through it healthy and every shot it takes I wanted to go in thanks for your time doc back to you Mike all right C some zone defense there from the Bucks in that first possession Celtics scored easily pis left open nice ball fake there comes up short on the shot we talk about defending the three Mike and when you say 16 attempts is too many if you're going to defend the three that means to limit attempts makes you can't really control after that ball goes up 16 attempts is way too many for the bucks to give up to the Celtics in the first White foul by Portis and Derrick white will shoot first foul Bobby Portis Neemias Queta has checked in for the Celtics for the first time with Pritchard Hauser white and Tatum right nowo on the bench so it's AJ Green just played the entire first quarter so is Joe moula going to match giannis's and all Horford's minutes all night that's interesting well you can do it early on maybe set the tone because I think if you get to that fourth quarter you get late Giannis versus Al Horford if Al Horford has played 35 37 minutes I don't see that number getting that high that's my point yeah starting the game with though starting the game with that tone I actually really really liked it he's averaging 28 minutes A Game season high is 34 Lillard to Portis opening minute here in the second quarter six-point lead for the Celtics they've led by as many as eight bucks have yet to leave Richard good defense a little blocked from behind by Queta Queta has given Bill Missoula some really nice minutes off the bench and not fouling not reaching in not doing something knowing he has help Portis on the follow couldn't get it to go green had to shoot it quick shot clock was winding down here's Tatum guarded by Lopez out on the perimeter Tatum gets away from Green gets into the paint using his strength and an offensive foul is going to be called okay now okay that's fine but to me that's a play you see Giannis make all the time so if it's a foul on Tatum why is it not a foul on Giannis and if I'm Tatum I'm frustrated by that and even more so if it's your second foul I look for me I think when you look at green we just had come on now stop it you game long career and another offensive fle this one's going to go against Bobby Porter and again again like I'm not sh foul in the post where Giannis did that to T and Tatum picked up a foul I personally don't think that was a foul on jayson Tatum his feet were uh Green's feet weren't set and he never pushed off it was just body to body well Portis picks up his second Tatum leans in to try to draw the contact now he's looking at the official and shouldn't be looking at the official he's jumping outside his motion yeah that was a good no call Lillard jump shot got it to go D Lillard double figures early and it's a four-point zel lead on a really nice as we said earlier a really nice nice roll over the last five games 25 or more in all of them P him the switch and Bump by Lopez who knows it picks up his second just Dam historically historic scening at the appropriate angles I just loved from the outset of that tandem it seems seamless between Lopez and Lillard well Lopez knows that the better screen he sets the more he will be open I big men understand that you set a screen you'll be open for the pop you set a good screen you'll be open on the roll something good will happen and Brook Lopez using that Stanford education and making sure he's setting quality screens well we've reached the knockout round in the second annual Emirates NBA cup Wednesday night on ESPN and ESPN Deportes we'll have one of the East quarter finals Nicks and the Hawks from New York NBA Countdown ticks off the coverage at tip off at about 710 a six-point lead for the Celtics bucks also in the quarterfinal round they'll play Orlando on Tuesday at home Lillard launches Lillard hits again he's five of eight from the field 13 points in 11 minutes come on it happens quick and my goodness that just right through the net T the CLS over and the Bucks defense flat putter there and Tatum now with a dozen and that's why you bring the big up in the pick and roll because if you could split it or beat the big there is zero help behind d ptis on the foul pis with his first two points but he has nine rebounds already a couple of them on just a couple of tips as Tatum shot rattles in and out K to the offensive board puts it on the floor drives on Lopez wasn't an easy pass ball knocked out of bounds still Celtic ball seven to shoot look at Damian Lillard work I mean he's got the big on him just gets RM dribble knows Kate is not going to be able to back and the quick release to Elevation it's just impossible to stop white catches back throws up an air ball Hauser has it shot clock winding down Tatum has to put it up comes up short and Portis already in double figures on the boards Lillard this time drives inside well defended by white Lillard gets it back backs it back up and in and a timeout called by Joe moua as Damian Lillard having his right right now they could win the title not a lot of people didn't put them in their Championship Contender category and that's because they lost in the first round the last two years but you look at them they had the third best record in the East last year they won 49 games and they did lose in the first round but Giannis did not play a game and Lillard missed two in a six game loss to the Pacers as knocks down the shot so if they stay healthy there's no reason why they can't be put into that category of one of the best in the East I have questions about them Mike and specifically is the bench good enough is Andre Jackson going to be playable in the playoffs and listen you've got time to develop that young man you mentioned Jackson's defensive abilities he's Elite but this is not a time in the NBA where you can play five on four and one guy is just not somebody you have to guard on the perimeter and offensively I'm not worried about them but defensively what is Khris Middleton going to be able to handle is Dane going to be handled a diet of pick and rolls every single night we know offensively I believe that they have a championship offense they have to get their defense back up to a top 12 top 13 Hauser had a nice steal but Tatum couldn't knock down the shot Lillard guarded by Hauser Hauser is a very good defensive player as Portis misses teams usually when he comes on the floor they they target him and often regret it Eric White keeps his dribble alive you got to go at somebody Mike so not a lot of options out there Mike good point BS that one check with Cassidy yeah you guys were talking about this being Damian Khris and giannis's Ninth game under doc together when I asked Damian Lillard about working Khris back into the mix he said I mean you can say what you want but you got to be on the court together to put it together and I think it's going to take some time but as long as we're able to continue to win and grow through it when it does connect hopefully at the right time it'll be the product that we want to give ourselves a chance to win guys thank you Cassidy Bobby Portis giving him a chance for second shot opportunities he's got 13 rebounds already and this is not a great offensive rebounding team I think that might be offensive rebound number seven I think pis has six of them as Hauser misfires on that one there in terms of rebounding they're dead last in the NBA as Gary Trent floats it up in Richard theer there's Tatum finds some room fires away can't get it to go and this if you're going to be if you're going to have a little bit of criticism it's the Celtics right now yes they've hit some threes they've missed some threes you want them to touch the paint one or two more times they had more Point uh points in the paint than the Bucks did in that first quarter you want to have a good balance shot clock at three Prince kicks it out CIS Tomley takes the three-pointer can't get it the fall they're now five of 11 that's why the Kristaps porzingis absence is significant for them tonight cuz they they get balance with him in the post nice feed Tatum to and that's what we're talking about jayson Tatum the maturity the growth what do we need right I missed a couple threes my teammates let's get a pick and roll let's hit the roller even if the roller doesn't finish it he will kick out to a more open three leads the team in scoring rebounding assists and steals Lopez travel do like to call but it you see the little slip by Queta how about that to make it the balls in your left get it to where it needs to be that's so good yeah and it's through Brook Lopez a good Defender let's see oh yes that was a twice double travel white long three-pointer knock out to Tatum Jaylen Brown that one's off miss their last nine from three but get another chance and Tatum foul by Middleton first foul on Middleton he's got six points in seven minutes in his first game of the season 25 of the 38 Shots by Boston off from three-point range they've taken 25 threes and there's still four and a half to go here in the second Horford back in Tatum to the rim just so so easy jayson Tatum when we talk to Joe missoui it's just the way he's thinking the game the way he's seeing the game anticipating the play we talked about they got to get in the paint before we know he's dropping a dime to somebody for a dunk and now he's attacking the paint he's recognizing that they've shot too many or they've missed too many Lopez knocks that down his first field goal well Joe maou is talking about both Brown and Tatum they're just they're reading what the defense gives them so well that's a huge step every year their Ascension as complete players both of them has really fun that makes them even more dangerous and it's the thing that maybe is least appreciated about jayson Tatum is how many different ways he affects the game and he Prides himself on it time with the Celtic set after her passing there are just so many people that you have a chance to touch and those people touch you it's just so sad when you Le one so young and so gifted and really like a lot of people you don't get a chance to say thank you heather was also honored before game one of the finals last season so in a way her presence was felt in the last two Celtics title runs Mike well Cassidy for those of us who knew Heather and you saw those shots of her with a big smile that that was her every day we talk about Lopez Sunshine every day that was Heather Walker and the imprint she had on this organization and still does as Tatum gets the rebound off the Miss three minutes left here first half Tatum lines that one up can't get it the fall and the Celtics have gone cold from three they started red hot 0 for 12 in the second Lillard dries high off the glass and a 17-point first half for Lillard he's just mixing his game right now the ability to get the three off quick but he has been so good on driving and it's been the electricity in the building even regular season is this your favorite place to call a game top top it's hard to pick it's hard to pick the favorite okay I like to say one of the favorites one of the favorites well all things NBA One Tap Away get the latest scores follow your favorite team and players and go behind the scenes all in one place download the NBA app today powered by Microsoft see if you if you mention what's your favorite when you go in other Arenas they say very mean things to you and your partner is a nudge going to call you a nudge I'm on National there's two gardens and but the Celtics are so gr he's an instigator yes he is that's exactly what he is thank you for noticing two two and a half remaining here the second Lillard looking finds Giannis stops goes up lays it up and in and fed in double figures 10 points the NBA's leading score he's averaging over 32 and2 points per game threes of Fallen Boston has relinquished the lead and as well as Jaylen Brown has played this year his efficiency hasn't been great yet from either the two or the three well he's one of those players that he focuses on the win you remember the little situation with him and Giannis and the fake handshake and the two slow well Jaylen Brown said it best we got the win that's the most important thing and I think Jaylen Brown numbers might go up and down efficiency might go up and down but ultimately his consistent approach in the way he's thinking the game that's what Joe moula Praises his on you know for for both Brown and Tatum the best statistic is Middleton come out with a steal Middleton goes inside side step throws it out Lillard up top AJ Green Oh it will forever frustrate me watching the game of basketball green had a layup if he would have kept in y that is not today's NBA mindset got Antetokounmpo posting up through holiday the spin move leans in lays it up and in Holiday thought should have been a charge there something to say to and Taylor as he goes up the floor got is starting to churn in the paint a little bit in that uh span he's up over 22 points per game Pon kicks it out holiday nice fake side step layup can't get it second effort no go and lope the rebound and Jrue holiday wasn't asking for a charge he was asking for 5 seconds that's what he said to Ben there quite some great defense there still bucks ball 12 to shoot also Boston they're not going to send extra people they're going to let you defend by yourself gathers using his strength backs at home he now has 14 and the bucks with their largest lead of the first half Jaylen Brown blows past Middleton reverse layup backs at home sweet move of Jaylen Brown he he had a layup on the left hand side yeah he did but but also how terrible defense is that if you're the Milwaukee bugs there there was one cross over and there's no one in the paint after you get a bucket after a made bucket you cannot do that especially the Milwaukee Bucks you're trying to get your defense set to have one person there is just unacceptable holiday second foul Brown another spin Ballo can't get that the fall t with a running start tum Batts into green goes inside this overwhelms the Bucks transition defense and S back within one gotot clock is turned off Boston does not have a foul to give somethings by the way they have done had a quarter the season not a quarter where they didn't make a three and they have not made one here in the second Lillard bumped shot counted and one Damian Lillard chance for a three-point play as Al Horford picks up his first and what a first half for liard now 34 years old he his 13th year second in Milwaukee after the first 11 of course with the Portland Trailblazers in a different role he was the man every single night in those 11 years in Portland and very open about trying to make it work with tone knows he doesn't have to score 30 for them to win two seconds to go Pritchard loves these shots did he get it fall up in time no not that time and the Bucks look how we put old man out there you're just an old soul that's all Horford three-pointer in and out and no porzingis Morford played 17 minutes in that first half porzingis just on injury management Antetokounmpo drives inside he lost his balance but Lillard there to rescue Lillard that floaters up and good boy he is in such a good Rhythm tonight and that low screen rooll you used to see it with Blake Griffin you used to see it with Khris Paul it is hard because there's no weak side Defender I know we asked for more Damian and Giannis pick and rolls but it's where you get him I think that's a perfect place this the largest lead for the Bucks bar White Off the Mark White's over for six including missed all five of his three-pointers Celtics have now missed 14 consecutive threes there's seven of 30 Lopez barely grazes the rim there oh nice crossover Brown gets the Finish beautiful move on K and did Brown just do you're too small those two had a little something going on Brown's going to get hit with a technical foul for to Camp point at a player the last time they played the two of them went back and forth at each other though he brought up that I think Jaylen was making the point to the official about well don't tell me I'm too small if you don't want to elbow no no I'm not I'm just saying a that's good logic there I like good logic back from like the 80s y's the dad now he's got the dad J very good and Antetokounmpo lost it but they say still bucks ball Horford saying no no no Giannis is looking at the the the Celtic big saying just everyone challenge it then challenge it if you guys don't like the call so the lbound with 14 on the shot clock let me say this I don't agree with the Giannis elbow but I'm saying when you taunt the big jump shot Lopez the tip lost the rebound taken away by Tatum all right the physical play is picked up as Trent fouls white and here we go so I got to say Al Horford against Giannis in the first half four for nine Giannis I've talked about Giannis coming off the most dominant month of his very historic career that last play Derrick white helped but you're living with what Al Horford is giving you one-on-one against Giannis in this basketball game white brings it out G Trent Jr starting the second half prin start of the first half Brown gets it kicks it out Horford wide open look for Horford and finally they knock down a three they missed 14 in a row and the Celtic's back within two and a whistle and a foul Horford’s upset felt Antetokounmpo pulled him down and the physical play has definitely taken a step up here I don't know did they call the foul on jayson Tatum jayson Tatum right hand fou is on Horford is second now Horford doesn't usually yell at Rex but he's letting him them know that he's not pleased at all and Antetokounmpo misses the first throw he was two for two in the first half you get that but watch jayson Tatum comes and hits his right there was one thing in particular that I saw from the Bucks bench and it's the Khris Middleton Khris Middleton called Dane Lillard over talked to him in his ear told him something that he saw how many players in the NBA can get Damian's attention and say hey come here and Damian went sprinting over there that's the IQ that's the play that they get now with Khris milon back they have someone that helps see the floor Tatum kicks it out Horford from the corner can't get it the fall it's Antetokounmpo with his sixth rebound Tatum guarding him Lopez Horford closes out nicely dangerous pass Antetokounmpo back up top Gary Trent lines it up can't get of the fall but Dre just just digging in but still able to recover on that challenge just such great individual defense he's been one of the leite defenders in the NBA for a long time Brown gets inside Lillard almost poked it away Derrick white can't hit long rebound Lillard Lillard competing defensively Lillard step back three-pointer airball much to the light of his CTIC crowd they were a little quiet in the second qu seven to have another special year but struggling tonight shooting Horford no hesitation there that went off we are now seeing some ugly three-point shooting how about this match up holiday Giannis spins blazs it up and in and they're willing to concede those two-pointers but the Celtics want to shoot 50 plus they want to make 23s if you want to slow down the game and post up they'll shoot all the threes and let you get those twos against Jrue they don't want to double team and then give up threes and give up open threes smart play there from Derrick white drawing the foul on Lillard first foul on Lillard hollan and Antetokounmpo they were wonderful teammates together obviously holiday such a perfect fit for Milwaukee to win the title in 2021 and they miss him they miss his toughness his leadership his defense and he did the same thing here he's been the perfect fit pretty much for every team he's played for and there was a little bit of energy when Damian Lillard came in and Jrue holiday left I think we'd be foolish to think that Jrue holiday didn't pick the Celtics because what for what's best for him but also because it's an opportunity to go and compete against the team that you want a championship away and wanted to move away from you D guarded by Horford been shooting that mid-range nicely this time doesn't settle for that instead a away from the elbow too strong crowd now cheering anything that goes wrong for theall brown and foul call on Gary Trent be a side out 13 foul I've been Hammer at this point Al Horford individually not sending an extra Defender is everybody ready to help if need be yes individually so much pride holiday spotting up Nails the through holiday with double figures Doc Rivers calls timeout Celtics come back to well still in the game Brown chasing him Lillard finds a tedo Giannis against Horford makes him take a tough shot he knocks it down and players like Giannis will make you pay but again pay attention that the Celtics don't help they don't come down and then allow Giannis to kick out we were talking dor you say he's averaging a career high assist how many's assists he have tonight zero and again it's goes to your point about you don't have to help show his game plan we have enough Elite Defenders then on there and we're going to shoot 53s if possible Lillard picked up his second foul on thatwhile Khris midon back in then played in that first half played 11 minutes Orford drives and spins on Trent there's a double team nice SP and tum throws it down Al Horford getting the start once again no porzingis he's been stting a lot this year Zing is just injury management Lillard three-pointer rattles in and out tatums got six rebounds to go with his 18 points Jaylen Brown try to spin move Pok out of bounds by L up on the other end your enjoyment of calling players old is disconcerted well as everyone called me old while I was still playing hayum fouled Middleton picks up something off and rivers has to go back to his side of a midcourt line they're going to wave off the foul are they waving or is it they saying it's on the floor not shooting yeah I think it's just non shooting Middleton drives goes revers a little too much English and holiday comes the other way Brown nice catch can't finish though oh second effort won't go here comes midon kicks it out blard Sid step three-pointer got it Damian Lillard with his fourth three-pointer he's got 26 I think his hand is fine Doris I think his hand is fine I think his hand is 100% F middle chasing Jaylen Brown holiday guarded by Giannis shot clock down to five Brown step back three-pointer that's good D Brown his third three-pointer and we're tied again Horford court on a screen Giannis this time against brown head down drives in lays it up and in just Unstoppable when he has a little room yeah so hard to keep in front of you but again it's all tough Twos for Giannis going through the chest of excellent Defenders Bowser knocks down the three Hauser second three-pointer he's in double figures Off the Bench and the Celtics after trailing by six here in the third of regain the lead ler drives on Hauser draws contact that will not count and little upset he thought that was in the very few guys they're going to bring help individually true holiday no need to bring help Alford but maybe just maybe if there's a mouse in the house and it's Pritchard Pati by the Boston Celtics you look at Payton Pritchard he could close his eyes know that the that the help was coming and Sprint to the weak side obviously there was a oh that's a foul call on Horford they tried to go back door on a l on the inbounds the ball happened before it an away the play foul got borski onepoint gain 331 remaining so let's see if it's one away from the play if the thoul occurs before Middleton releases the pass boy that's close that's really close yeah I I think that was probably the right call he says after the fact and brown brown has the same thing as Portis gets thrown down that's true foul I like this match up stop I got next you like that match up RJ only in 2K let's goated e for everyone look at you wow a multiac and multitalent you know what the best part about filming that commercial is my two little boys got to come because wimy was their favorite player so they got to meet wimy and he was outstanding I got to give him credit sure the paycheck was a good part of it oh yeah that was a good part too because they paay for the boys to come a holiday can't hit pis with his 14th rebound quick guarding Antetokounmpo now Horford picks him up there's the jump shot a much improved jump shot he hits again and 23 now for Giannis he's just so comfortable mik he's only taken 14 threes there was a point at which you worried was his pride getting to him about the three-point he's almost eliminated it from his game well he he was not hitting it at a high percentage as Brown gets into the paint and pulls up jump shot rattles around falls off the r Middleton there has not been a double digit lead in this game largest lead for Boston is eight for Milwaukee six we just under two and a half to go in the third and holiday pumps into midd and free throws from M the viewers of ESPN over all these years the generosity and the the kind of money that they they donate has just been extraordinary and we thank you once again for all your generosity and what's such a special and important week for us Mike every dollar donated goes to cancer research it is a well-run organization maybe nothing we're prouder to be associated with than the commitment of this company to the fight Brown Hauser Pritchard Horford and white out there Browns kicks it out Hauser that quick release hits a three saner now with 13 points in 16 minutes and it's back to one as are coming off that season High 20 points on Wednesday when he started for Tatum this continues his Improvement at TPA one1 with Horford Horford Horford loves those situations Middleton comes up short still after all these years you can see he just gets so fired up to play against somebody like a TPA oneon-one Brown gets pass gets inside poor defense that time for the bucks and brown took full advantage and right now the Boston Celtics are up by one with one to go in this quarter but P Pritchard has not scored Derrick white is 0 for seven from three so it's they're doing it with the other group as you see green knocked down the three but that's how dominant this team can be Payton Pritchard average 23 points over his last five hasn't scored tonight because he is one of their bench like primary players and the Celtics are just fine by the way that's Green's first bucket and an excellent three-point shooter All Season shot clock down to six Trent guarding Brown Trent a good Defender Brown Rises up can't get it the fall Porter quick Outlet to middlen Mid looking to post up Richard double team finds auma bounces and stops Giannis throws it down he's got 25 11 here in this period and a fourpoint you know eventually you're going to wear on guys get to your spots you guys have mentioned this very quiet in here right now Horford searching for Hauser Koo guarding Jaylen Brown now Portis picks him up for a shoot Brown makes his move stops elbow jumper bounces off the rim won't go foris with his 16th rebound Giannis to Middleton Middleton a three-pointer and that will end get any transition got some pce in the points in the third quarter but doing a decent job you guys are hot and cold from three in a physical game what do you want to see offensively to close this one out strong just continue to fight for the right shot we can get out and transition get some easy ones thanks for your time coach back to you Mike all right C Tatum knocks down to three makes it a one-point game Joe moula is 36 years old now his third year what an extraordinary job he has done here and it's it's fun to talk to him cuz he thinks differently than a lot of other coaches and one of the things you know you hear coaches will say is Lillard trying to find some room Queta excellent defense prit comes out and we'll go the other way you know coaches will say stop thinking too much just play he says that's wrong he goes you can never overthink in basketball you can never not think the game and it's he says if you're overthinking you're thinking about the wrong thing if you're not thinking this game if you're not reading and reacting and paying attention that's when you get in trouble Richard from the time you entered the league to this point now would you say it's getting harder and harder if you can't think the game at a high level to play in the NBA oh Tatum and a foul chance for a four-point play and the Celtics regain the lead so after going seven for 16 in the first they went five his shot but back to your point though Doris I think it's actually easier because it's very 3o three inde D so the game is not as complicated before it's easier play it's easier now wow but great players are still going to think the game at that level but I think for role players it's easy because they have just defined roles across the league with three and D players Lopez they still a minute G by here in the fourth Celtics now back up by three Lillard draws the foul on Tatum and Tatum trying to say I'm in the upward motion that's the third time it's been very close and all three times it's been a side out start to raise up the referees want you raising up and then foul green rattles at him green falling sideways there able to hit he he's become so much more aggressive and willing to take shots under duress he made one in the third just like that Lopez jayson Tatum as it poked away look at Lopez out on the perimeter calling jayson Tatum green goes to help Pritchard had to go off his legs but white right there to save it shot clock at three white fires it up and Portis grabs the rebound 17 boards for Bobby Portis Portis little push shot gets it to go so seven points for Portis as well block back up by two another three-pointer going down all of a sudden guys knock him down threes that is awful defense by the buck Hauser he gets one pass off a made shot and gets an open three that is not the defense that the Bucks used to be or need bis posting up white bang shot way off rebound Tatum Tatum finds white white no hesitation three side of the rim and Gary Trent comes the other way white 0 for nine from the field Pritchard trying to pester Lillard gets past and goes inside banks at home and a foul Queta chasing him down and Lillard using the rim to Shield kadum 25 or more in each of the last six games in shooting over 50% from the field he's 11 of 19 tonight and now has 29 Points bucks back up by two B who started the season one and six they have looked like a different team last couple of weeks and now with Khris middlen even better paid him off the bounce double team white drives goes all the way to the rim and lays it up it's jayson Tatum's patience they are attacking Lopez trying to draw him away from the cup and get him to guard on the perimeter as soon as two go to the ball that first pass so important and attack a close out that's White's first field goal has some free throws but now one for 10 five on the 24 Lillard against Queta Queta trying to stay with him falling away well defended that time Portis another offensive rebound bank shot and lays it in did he travel Mike it look like Happy Feet there well also it looked like he lost the ball yeah tried to grab and pick it up that's what the Boston Celtics bench was talking about but Portis is tied to season high with 18 boards Tatum against trck spins struggling a bit spins again gets inside and lays it in look like he was going to lose the ball instead of beautiful move to the basket 29 for Tatum and now the crowd has come alive little it off the bounce Trent Corner three got it Gary Trent with his third three-pointer Junior the three a timeout called by Joe moula back and forth they go still seven that was the first time that they had left strong side shooter they were conceding to and that's why Joe moua called a timeout and if you get a chance Howser's reaction new holiday back in tat him on the drive on Trent kicks it out to White extra pass holiday point three puts it up puts it in through holiday with his fourth three-pointer and the Celtics have tied it again holiday ging Lillard who's g off for 29 Points Trent AJ Green that pass stolen by Derrick white Hauser can't get it to go by the way that was the first turnover of this half by either team incredible Antetokounmpo drives and finishes the long strides makes it look easy no Mike you were talking about it's been a clean game you see it's not we can talk about the defense but ultimately don't turn over the ball the Boston Celtics are one of the best at not turning over the ball in the league and you combine that with the way they score it can be a problem offord misses Lillard tips it to AED ball approaching the Midway point of the fourth quarter Giannis has Hauser on him Horford waiting to help Antetokounmpo goes the other way now backing in goes away from Tatum lays it up and in beautiful move from Giannis Antetokounmpo it's ridiculous it's so hard to guard him over the course of 48 minutes the NBA's leading score now at 29 and nine rebounds holiday looking Horford trying to seal Lillard on the mismatch Horford stri by Lillard excellent hands from Damian Lillard holiday almost stole that and Antetokounmpo had it knocked out of his hands still bucks ball Horford saying a challenge and yes Joe moula is going to challenge it said Boston ball going to break white down the other end five and a half hands aart of the ball that's what Lillard trying to say you know the assistant coach who's behind every bench and has that the iPad there and has to quickly look at the replay and then make it decision to tell the coach that's a difficult job and an important one now throughout the NBA quantum mechanics is next on Richard's list to talk about our upcoming Emirates NBA Cup schedule double header on Tuesday on TNT we'll have one game Wednesday on ESPN Hawks and Knicks from the garden hands a part of the ball that's what Lillard trying to say you know the assistant coach who's behind every bench and has that the iPad there and has to quickly look at the replay and then make a decision to tell the coach that's a difficult job and an important one now throughout the NBA quantum mechanics is next on Richard's list to talk about our upcoming emeres NBA Cup schedule double header on Tuesday on TNT we'll have one game Wednesday on ESPN Hawks and nicks from the garden and then another game on TNT at night Warriors and Rockets can't wait for those quarterfinals the winners of those games get to go to Vegas and keep a hope their lives are over $500,000 pay day for the team that wins it all Lopez looking a post up white Lopez back up at Antetokounmpo Trent catches fires can't get it to go and Tatum with his eighth rebound very makeable shot cuz Boston's trying to get out of bad matchups Trent had a good look at it Giannis Antetokounmpo former Defensive Player of the Year oh what a pass and holiday backs at home with the left hand Tatum with a beauty a one-point game with four and have to play Lillard trying to draw contact no call he was upset shot came close to going in Tatum in the front Court drives past green left back it in Tatum first with a pass then with a bucket and the Celtics regain the lead timeout Milwaukee 32 points for jayson Tatum jayson Tatum and A one-point lead for the Celtics Antetokounmpo 29 Points Tatum guarding him shot clock at nine puts his head down and a foul on Tatum that's going to be four on Tatum third team foul against the Celtics and now if you watch Damian Lillard in these last four minutes he's had Pritchard he's had different Defenders now Jaylen Brown so in the last four minutes yes he's had a great game and Jaylen Brown's done done a good job but he's got a much bigger defender on him the last four minutes Middleton on the court the fourth quarter for the first time jump shot in and out Tatum with his 10th rebound Middleton by the way has played 19 minutes in his first game of the season Brown nearly slips lost the ball momentarily here's Derrick white white drives inside Stripped by Trent white trying to get it back it's going to go down the other way different level of competitive toughness of the Milwaukee only the second turnover of the second half for the Celtics three and a half remaining Middleton off in the closer when he was healthy pulls up jump shot can't get it the fall Lopez caral the rebound can't get the follow missed the tip as well and wipe the rebound holiday keeps that Tribble alive pass deflected by Middleton ball loose pick up by holiday now Horford Horford across the lane six on the shot clock holiday three-pointer way off rebound Trent and you see the defensive effort by the Bucks their season will be determined by how well they play defense Lillard with the slam wide open Lane and Damian Lillard now with 31 just gets that corner turned painted is empty bucks back up on top two and a half remaining Lopez with the help defensively Tatum gets away from him left-handed pass Brown up top Horford fakes Horford drives gets inside the pass block but a whistle fires away shot back of the rim won't go and the rebound goes to White that would have been a two-pointer his foot was on the line two minutes remaining in a point game crowd getting on its feet here at the TD Garden There He Go Brook Lopez up again in the screen and roll Tatum drives goes inside back out holiday fakes fires a three back to the rim Gary Trent with a rebound how about that look to the right that sell that Defender Antetokounmpo a three-pointer that misses that's his first three-point attempt of the game only the 15th of the Season Horford with a three and the Celtics there has not been a double figure lead in this game it's been tight throughout largest lead here in the fourth quarter is four which is what the Celtics have right now Middleton in his first game gets away from Horford drives inside the running layup blocked by Horford athetic a rebound and fouled on the follow and he'll shoot two free throws with 11 remaining he's three for four from the line tonight 111 to go who since May his first game in the fourth quarter 1 minute to go doc riers calls a play to have him handle the ball that's the importance of Middleton yes he didn't score but having him back is so important to this Buck stand Giannis 61% from the line this season and misses the first that's why it was such a good foul by Jrue holiday down there there holiday's fourth foul it's only the 14th free throw attempt of the game for Milwaukee same amount as Boston and that one perfect three-point game Bucks have one timeout remaining Celtics have two Milwaukee still with a foul to give as we approach a minute left corner threee from Brown shot short a Antetokounmpo throws it ahead to Lillard Lillard fires up a three way off rebound holiday white was there to defend good ball the a from Middleton as brown wanted to cut back door Lopez once again picks up Tatum on the screen eight on the 24 Tatum the crossover Tatum the drive goes inside kicks it back out holiday the floaters up got it as the shock clock expires Jrue holiday puts the suffix up by five with 25.6 remaining both Trent Lillard and green midleton looking Tri ball and out from holiday Lillard can't get free green has it back to Middleton Middleton puts up a threes foul Brown can't believe the call a little pump fake Joe moua still has a challenge left because he was successful on the first and Joe manoula is out right away after review we see that Jaylen Brown has his left hand on the the body of Khris Middleton and also graded his body on his way down it's going to be a defensive foul on Jaylen Brown It's going to be three free throws two wow so it is the shot that's before the upward motion foul is right there this to me should I mean he's not in his motion there initially I didn't think I thought it was before now moua does because they lose the tier from middle in his first game of the season this the first 21 and now to the free throw line where he's four for four tonight well he's one of the best free throw shooters when healthy in this leag that's why he's such a great closer but again we talked about this is going to become a free throw game because the Bucks have to foul right away and they have no time outs so they're not going to be able to advance it so each time they foul they're going to have to bring it up so it's going to be even more imperative for the Celtics to knock down their free throw 88% for his career hits all three two-point game shot clock is turned off dangerous pass but Tatum gets it and Tatum is fouled with 19.9 man so jayson Tatum will get the two free throws I believe that's a second foul in the last two minutes first in the last two minutes or first in the last two minutes now the officials initially signaled he's shooting and now they're putting it on the side so it's just the first in the last two minutes and that's why the buck went for a trap because they did have a foul to give that was their one opportunity to try and get something easy Tatum looking good ball denile throws it in the back court green goes to chase holiday holiday gets away from him taking more time off holiday still without a foul and now they called it green had to chase it down and precious seconds KCK off so now holiday will shoot with 14.9 remaining team Li holiday will be at the line with twoot well holiday tonight has not shot a free throw and for the season he's 91% he's taken 33 free throws he's missed only three around a little bit that makes it a three-point game again Milwaukee out of timeouts talking about if you coming off a live ball rebound here are you fouling up three if he doesn't make this I'm talking about obviously now Missoula has his own rules what I am saying is yes you foul because time is their enemy they can't Advance the ball cley s both four-point game Antetokounmpo to Middleton knocked Away by white white comes up with a steal now white will dribble it out 6 seconds remaining gets away from Green throws it into Horford the Celtics are going to win wiford banks at home a Boston Celtics Championship resilience on
