 the NBA this year it's good to have that man back the heat lost both games that he's missed this year it's more than his 24 points a game it's his overall feeling for the offensive end agre his playmaking his decision making so important and the threat that he provides every time he takes the floor makes the game easier for those around our officials are Scott Foster Carl Lane and Brett Nel and heat Nation off we go on another their Miami Heat NBA Adventure here in OKC they stand until the home team scores he get the first H back on a Herro pitch for a b three kaboo great offense there driving and kicking that's a big part of what coach fster talked about he wanted to see better spacing he wanted to see decision making uh when you're getting towards the paint Tyler Herro bringing it there with that driving kick to b seven straight game B triple that's Dort for the Nifty left hand flip L Dort looks like a linebacker plays like a shooting guard at 64 220 heat ahead by one this is Wiggins posting up Shai Gilgeous Alexander got the basket and Drew the foul really nice move here by Wiggins his ability to create off the dribble is going to be one of the positive things that we're going to see from him here and looking him getting to the spin move using his height shooting right over top of Shai Gilgeous Alexander who's 66 by the way and a Wiggins at 67 but able to make enough of a move with that bump to create some space and shoot with touch John that by accident Wiggins gets a quality touch in the poster expulsure trying to Fast Track his his comfort level with his new team I think he wants to see him continue to play with great confidence but also Freedom out here and if he can attack off the dribble the he need players to be able to do that on their own without having to constantly break screens and and and all kind of of actions for him he has the ability to go one onone Gil Alexander got body fou by Tyler Herro John that's a tough match up for Herro matter of fact for everyone in the NBA trying to guard the unguardable this year in this guy who mixes it up with drives and jump shots top score in the league for a reason over 32 points a game he is wonderful being able to do what he just did which is draw contact and get himself uh to the free throw line he'll take almost nine free throws a game with his ability to make that kind of uh draw and and foul getting inside in that attack mode going to the basket bloody nose for heat Center Kel'el we making his 11th straight start 37th game of his rookie year West Brown taking good care of the big fell John he he's had his typical rookie ups and downs but his emergence and his partnership in the front court with bam has given heat Nation New Hope and and this team different spin on them yeah so important uh the the presence that he's provides um as a threat going to the basket a lob threat he's been able to spread the floor and and make threes and and then his his Rim protection is undeniable U love love the dimension he's bringing over the last 14 games he's been averaging a double double in terms of points and rebounds uh really really impressive stretch here by the rook and Bam too thriving in in his spot alongside so Gilgeous Alexander a guy who gets to the free throw line often second in the league at almost nine free throw attempts a again a 64 lead early on for the heat Tyler Herro sending it back this is Davion Mitchell bams jumper short and the rebound comes to Shai Gilgeous Alexander the 66 guard in his seventh season out of the University of Kentucky J he's one of the few players still taking a steady di of mid-range jump shots great Hustle by hartenstein to give the Thunder an extra possession that's his game right there creating extra opportunities for his team through that physicality and hard work he went down on the deck there averages over three offensive rebounds the game good defense on Shai Gilgeous Alexander they're contesting but Loose ball look at the big man at 7 foot go down and create that kick out Wiggins with a pretty blocked shot by the way Gilgeous Alexander now guarded by Davion Mitchell he's physical Alexander missed it Wiggins with the rebound looping a long atlet for the Breakaway man dve yon Metro nice to see a fast break score for the he yeah it's nice to see great contest on a shooter like Shai gild Alexander without fouling I like that defense leading off this is Aaron Wiggins we get a moving screen on hartenstein that's the first foul on the seventh year Pro out of Eugene Oregon to dive to the basket he's an excellent screener here's the one-on-one defense with Mitchell contesting on the ball forcing him into a tough shot Shai Gilgeous Alexander usually able to get to the spot on the floor he wants Mitchell making it tough there and then being able to be rewarder with that layup Wiggins guarded by Wiggins oh the pass intercepted by hartenstein trying to get it two where this is Jalen Williams Miss handles and Wiggins comes up with a steal for Maya Thunder commit the fewest turnovers in the league by the way that's Herro and that's good a pretty runner for Tyler Herro his first score puts Miami in front by six a nice couple of minutes for the heat they've hit for their first five shots that's Aaron WIS he missed it Herro runs it down oh Thunder missed four of their first five hereo euro SK nice flip for a Pam slam what a feed the Vision by Tyler Herro went behind the head with that pass he on a 60 run with that delivery by Tyler part Stein's hook comes down the B so far so good for the heat the Thunder now one to their first six this is Wiggins on the Baseline guarded by D here driving on Wiggins to the dotted line came up short here's d stutter stepping got there and Drew the foul plus the score pretty play by 25y Lou Dort f is onwar L Dort is like just a physical big Bulldog out there at 64 220 lbs falling down after getting tripped up and able to get it up with some touch and one opportunity for him he's two for two now from the field Dart averaged 17 points a game three years ago this scoring has declined in each of the last three seasons by the way this year under 10 points a game he's already got five you I think he just continues to make the right plays though we heard coach dag talk about he's become a more efficient player being able to shoot the ball he's a 41% that's a career high from three so he's taking better shots but they rely on his defense and his physicality on that end Thunder we in a 23 Zone it didn't bother bam or Miami a bit seven early points for Adebayo on three of four shooting against the best defensive team in the league Miami's made six of their first eight shots that's great defense by Davion Mitchell but a late F called against Mitchell you're getting a little taste of the kind of Defense on the ball that Davion Mitchell likes to wow is he physical on the ball Jak gild using that aggression against him though watch him change direction here then and then get into the body and Scott Foster rewarding Shai gilg just there with with a two free throw uh foul there on on baby on MIT John the the Thunder very interesting team they're they're the youngest team in the NBA right now they're also the best team in the league with their record so they are young but they don't play Young it's a very mature team oriented game they put defense first yeah the defense first mentality and there's coach deau right there has been instilled they they're bringing in players at a young age that have a defensive Edge and and coaching them that way that's just part of of what you got to do to be able to get minutes on the floor and they've developed a nice nucleus of of players they they just have to continue to develop in the playoffs and go deeper oh the Heat beat the shot clock and Bam hits the jump hook so a very efficient start for bam and Miami he's got nine points coming back the other way that's Jalen Williams he's going to get a chance at his first two points of the game from the free throw line he's the first time Allstar now in his third season out of Santa CLA another excellent pick by their GM Sam prey got him with a 12th pick in the 2022 draft let's pause for a quick word from FP you deserve a power company that delivers reliable electricity where you need it when you need it FPL working for you every single day Tyler Hera and Kel'el Ware go out coming in for the heat Alec Burks and Nikola Jovic Burke started the last game against the Celtics when Herro was out Jalen Williams 23 years old only his third year averaging a career best 21 points per game he's another outstanding perimeter Defender Mitchell on the layup off glass a Davion Mitchell with two early scores f you worried about offense worry no longer they he have made eight of their first 10 shots here in Oklahoma City great drive and attack gets a hesitation move see sees there's a window to get it up uses the backboard nicely and Davion Mitchell putting the heat up by eight to join captiv Health's Miami Cancer Institute in the fight against cancer and bounce back from cancer with us choose your distance dribble or walk either 14.2 miles 6 miles or 2 miles and finish right here on the hardwood at CA Center in downtown Miami if you would scan that QR code and join our team how good is it to get Tyler herro back look at this Vision here going behind the head to find bam on the interior couple of assists already for Tyler as he sat sits down now oh Aaron Wiggins laying it in over Aaron Wiggins for his first score miam's lead is six even though they Heat have made eight of their first 10 shots down on this end bam Adebayo started quickly he's already got nine points make it 11 what a first step and finish for Adebayo 11 points on five of six shoot Bo quick shimmy there to get around Hartenstein left him in the dust getting on top of the rim bam aggressive here early good close out on Jalen Williams and the rebound for Adebayo the he started this game off playing terrific basketball bam coming in hartenstein again bam keeping it alive incredible hustle for the heat Captain will be Thunderbolt he is been outstanding 11 points for bam on five of seven shooting look at the quick face up and absolutely Jukes his way past hartenstein here attacking that Baseline and getting on top of the rim and leaving that seven-footer behind he'd have been dominant in the paint and much of that goes to the credit of bamama they've been able to score to high level on the Interior right now he's already got two dunks giving him 88 for the season about 16 to four advantage in the paint bam created that turnover wheel deflection here's Mitchell driving in with a left hand and finishing six first quarter points for Mitchell they have forced the Thunder into a timeout the Heat lead by 10 they've hit 10 of their first 13 shots aggressive on the ball getting in that passing Lane deflection by bam and Mitchell coming in two onone with the Layin Damon Mitchell six points on a perfect three for three from the field well the heat defense has really come out with an edge to start this game holding OKC to just 33% shooting on 309 and forced three turnovers and this OKC team second in the league in terms of taking care of the ball so the pressure has been really good but he have been able to get in the passing lanes and create some Havoc with the flections and steel that's young Mark dnal the 39-year-old head coach of the thunder in his Fifth Season he's done a terrific job for them in the mold of Eric spola in Miami both programs looking up to each other that's the fourth turnover of a quarter they only average 12 turnovers a game 540 left first quarter heat ahead by 10 Burks up top guarded by Alex Caruso Joe in he's defending Wiggins Wiggins has two fouls he's also drawn two fouls well he went right down inside had the smaller Joe on him and he's posting up Wiggins and Wiggins gets right to the middle here un aable to split this double team as Caruso tried to come down from the top the fouls on Joe Two Shots here now they gave it to kusu oh they did I'm the reaching now coming from the top so Wiggins will get two free throws we're going Aaron Wiggins a 78% free throw shooter this year 73% over his 11 years in the league it's his 45th game this season is second with the heat since coming over in the butler trade with golden stad now nice start for him tonight nice start for the Heat tonight ahead by 11 this is Joe he's a electrifying guard off their bench gets tripped up and taken down on B's first foul of the game Joe didn't play in Monday night's win over New Orleans with a seore knee he's lightning quck hard attack on the Baseline B Just Enough of a nudge there to push on him looks like Joe will get to the line here for two young fell at a Fort Smith Arkansas he was a second round pick back in 2020 B Joe averaging just under 10 points a game this season for them he was at eight points a game a year ago he's had four double figure scoring games against the Heat early in his career the Thunder have already been the little strip nine times in this first quarter Miami has a 10-point lead Jovic being guarded by the rookie Dylan Jones out of Weaver State Jones was a late first round pick last June Caruso excellent defender on Aaron Wiggins five him a shot clock Caruso this could be a defensive 3se second violation against the thunderc violation technical free technical free throw awarded to Miami on the defensive 3se second call against deal Thunder Mark dagal former assistant coach at Holy Cross was an assist assistant at the University of Florida under Billy Donovan you see Jalen Williams looking a little lost in space there that's the other Jalen Williams a third-year man from Arkansas did you imagine that they have two players with the same name they they spell their first names differently but that's Jalen Williams from from Arkansas in his third year he averages six points a game that's Jalen Williams from Santa Clara who made the All-Star team for the first time this season well the biggest difference is the height Jalen W Wiggins Williams excuse me from Arkansas is 610 250 so but the names don't make it easy that's for sure I got a good story to tell you about that when the opportunity allows five on the shot clock for Mitchell long rebound taken by Wiggins Jovic driving in he spreading it around that's Wiggins and that's short from three rebound to the Thunder Miami in front by 11 Shai Gilgeous Alexander on the move missed it Dylan Jones missed it but Alexander gets it back Jalen Williams missing and Burks has the rebound a thunder three for 11 422 left first quarter nice screen by bam that's going to be a foul on Dylan Jones wait bam Adebayo doing some big time work here in the first quarter for Miami is Jovic may have bumped his n Jovic got hit in the face too there between bam and Jovic both of them bent over licking their licking their wounds on that Poss first foul on Dylan Jones a bang of the knees here in OKC get a look at it here comes Jovic bumping with Dylan Jones gets to the paint oh what a pretty live for Bam's third dunk of the first corter the heater hting the thunder in the paint that's 13 points for pen Joe missing Jovic with the rebound the heat ahead by 13 just under 3 minutes left and what's been a brilliant first quarter for the visiting heat Mitchell gets a screen from B back to the big fell and the rebound comes down to the thund good good shot though I like how Davion Mitchell executed that high pick and roll there got everyone to their spaces bam able to get a pretty good look oh Shai Gilgeous Alexander with a floating Baseline jump shot for his first field goal plus he drew the foul on Alec Burks he's a really interesting player at 66 able to get in shoots a lot of these mid-range shots outside of the paint able to draw the contact there on Burks and and lean in afterwards and and still make the shot unlike a lot of players he shoots quite a bit of those mid-range shots over six field goal attempts a game in that mid-range area outside the paint Mitchell and Bam both come out heith is in so is Kel'el wi Haywood heith a man who has started plenty for the Heat this year 39 starts a career high for him this season 320 left first quarter Burks lobbing where missing on the Finish but he did draw the foul underneath and it's going to go on Shai Gilgeous Alexander that's his second foul this is a really nice lob action here from Alec Burks he throws this up high and Ware right in the right area for him to go get it Shai Gilgeous Alexander getting into the chest there of Ware and impacting his ability to catch and finish that shot or that pass well Jim I was talking to to the Oklahoma City radio voice Matt Pinto I said as a radio guy how do you distinguish between the two Jalen Williams Jalen Williams from Santa Clara they refer to here as Jalen Williams the other Jalen Williams is known as Jay will so here in this market they differentiate that way Jalen Williams and Jay will maybe we should try but where gets his first two points of the strike that's Williams the seventh year Pro from Texas Christian University it's his first score of the game Miami in front by 10 Jovic on the move Williams oh that's Dylan Jones knocking it free but throwing it to Herro and he was at a bad now Scott Foster coming with the the table L crui Scott Foster one of the most veteran one of the most proficient officials in the world in the world of basketball 31 years in the NBA he's officiated in 255 playoff games he's worked 25 games in the NBA Finals tells you all you need to know about his level of work under 3 minutes left first quarter a 10-point Heat lead here a bump by kenrich Williams heith against Joe and through the legs and hands of way only the second turnover of the quarter for the heat Shai Gilgeous Alexander staying in the game with his two fouls working against heith Williams missing the rainbow three good defensive rebound by burs here five for 15 the Thunder Herro inside on Shai Gilgeous Alexander missed the bank shot where missing on the tip Yan Jones working against Jovic bouncing outside for Joe he lost the ball but picks it back up Williams streaking in for Kusa another stop for the Heat under two minutes left first quarter good catch by Burks deep in that corner and he gets fouled by Joe that's his first foul of the game Watch Burks working here gets fouled and should have let it go he's smiling saying I should have shot it he would have had a a three shot opportunity Instead This is a bonus opportunity here two free throws Burks averaging six points a game for the Heat this season Off the Bench and I think we were about to see a challenge there by dagal but he was late coming over to call the timeout and ball had already been delivered to Alec Burks uh at the free throw line so he no longer had the time to be able to call that timeout in charge you never know where you're going to find the coaches of tomorrow before they arve Mark dnel was the student manager for Jim Calhoun at the University of Connecticut pretty good first first opportunity yes sir look he put his time in five years in the G league with the OKC blue before getting uh the opportunity to move up into the uh with with the main team here the Thunder Shai Gilgeous Alexander got fouled by heith who crowed him shooting the three so he's going to get three free throws here that's ironic that dig would take over for Billy Donovan a man he once assisted in Gainesville at UF heith got too close and picks up a crossly f yeah nine free throws a game you want to be the one of the top scorers in the league and he is the top scorer you got to get to the free throw line on nights you're not making a lot of shots that free throw line will continue to give you the opportunity to manufacture points he gets to that line nine times a game he's going to get there eight times here in this quarter alone last 10 games for him he's averaging 37 points a game he's had three games Sean of 50 points or better since late January scored 54 against Utah had 52 at Golden State and a 50-point game against Phoenix and and he's not doing it in a new fangled way shooting a lot of Threes John it's an old school approach for a bright youngst yeah he really balances it between getting in the paint he's number five in that area at almost 15 points a game but he also will get to the mid-range game and out Beyond The Arc and he does it with a high percentage approach he's 53% shooter so he's not just taking a lot of shots he's he's doing it efficiently Herro almost turned it over ball comes back to him you think about what Gilgeous Alexandri is doing it it's rare Jovic finishes Nikola Jovic that's a great straight line drive and finish for him I'd love his continued growth in terms of being strong going in the basket using his height Shai Gilgeous Alexander that's a good description for him that man's strong going to the goal he's got eight uh 10 first quarter points for the thunder look out Jovic able to get it back the the rookie playing good defense on him Burks short from three gets it right back Tyler out of the corner could not get it off 33 seconds left first qu Burks checking the clock now firing on Caruso and rattling down a triple Alec Burks that's his 40th triple this year he shoots 44% from downtown the four points for Burks 18 seconds left in the quarter the heat by 11 Joe and Burks from behind kendri Williams able to grab that rebound Tyler Herro accelerating pass Caruso well done for the Heat's first time Allstar Tyler Herro that's his second score of the game and the Heat and the first quarter on a high note a 36-point quarter and a 13-point lead Nikola Jovic coming off the bench strong Drive getting to that right hand and finishing with the left and Alec Burks able to convert along two here with this step back and how about Tyler Herro the allstar finishing the the quarter getting to that right hand Runner after the fake pass heat looking good and on top aame for heat Nation how about this up to 80% off select items that sounds too good to pass up scan the QR code and you won't pass it up scan that QR code you can purchase right now by the way they have changed Alec Burke's three to a two so it's a 3523 lead for Miami that's what I like a a mixed marriage right split household right there either way somebody will be happy A house divided in that case can stand they welcome you back Eric Reed John crate and our FanDuel Sports Network crew beautiful first quarter for the heat on both ends of the floor they shot 61% they held the hunt Thunder to 32% shooting that's Williams short on the three so they're one of seven from downtown to begin this game I mean the score 36 points against the number one uh defensive rated team in the league really impressive start for Miami and and on the other side defensively they've been really stingy making things tough 31% they've held the Thunder to we're a minute in the second quarter hartenstein pass deflected by Herro that's already five turnovers for the Thunder uncharacteristic start to the game for them Jovic b a foul by Williams on his way in they finally calling Carl Lane shreking that play from the Baseline the foul will be on Jalen Williams that's the allstar version of Jalen Williams he picks up his first foul of the game he's fighting through a lot of these hand checks too and that's what I like to see from Nikola Jovic he's definitely a stronger player he's physical but he's also getting down lower he's powering through some of the reging uh that he's seeing and at 610 240 lbs it's a great advantage to have that kind of skill set be that strong but he's got to continue to work through that make the Thunder pay with these free throw they had 10 points and eight rebounds against the Celtics Monday night the eight rebounds tied as season High got three points tonight Miami in front by 13 it's 36- 23 this equals the Heat's biggest lead of the game Hartenstein guarded by Kel'el Ware Joe Herro under the screen miss another three and Kel'el Ware grabs the rebound in the corner Herro got bumped by Joe got pass him went through the stop sign for the score that's six points for Tyler Herro and it's a 15-point Heat lead he'll be featured here with this second unit Tyler Herro great one-on-one attack on that Baseline nice attack for Jalen Williams the gentleman out of Denver Colorado his first field goal made tonight need have been pushing the pace a bit that's a allowing them to to beat the set defense that Oklahoma City would provide in the half court Jovic backs up and fires rebound missed by heith but the attack on the offensive glass earned him a foul it's going to be on hartenstein great effort by Haywood heith coming from the weak side here and gets kind of grab there by hartenstein as it was going up to lay that one in it'll be two shots here for Haywood so John coming off their two lowest scoring games of the year in a two- game losing streak at Brooklyn and at home to Boston they come here short-handed they had a a team meeting in a film session last night good shoot around today they have come ready to compete so far offering up the a version of their game yeah I love it and I think the the thing that right off the bat has been jumping out at me is the spacing and the decision making something that was a huge point of emphasis by coach SPO the spacing has been good they've been staying wide out there on the perimeter making it difficult for for any one Defender to guard two players and they've been able to get good shots as a result of the decision Jalen Williams as it roll off hartenstein on the second try tips it in first score for a guy who's been with a bunch of teams the Rockets Denver Cleveland the Clippers he had two really good years for a a good Knicks team but they let him go in free agents honstein inking here a three-year $87 million deal Jovic got got contacted not get a foul call and he's hobbling back to the defensive end they almost turned it over kenrich Williams you're a stepping pass Ware for the score that's a pretty play for Williams prompting Eric spoler into a timeout coach SPO wants to know where that foul was on the Jovic James Dawkins director heat content Studio after years of creatively contributing through the lens by which he saw the game Dawkins now helps provide vision into a younger generation of Talent with his inspirational leadership and experienced oversight we produce a lot of content here at the heat so I oversee the logistics the collaboration the overall execution on these projects for Dawkins Excellence is defined as much by perspective as it is performance Excellence is a matter of perspective you can look at it one way which is uh going to be conflict or the other way which is solution Excellence is the solution and it's not just once it's consistent James Dawkins shaping the way Excellence is created we are so glad you get to meet some of the people behind the scenes who deserve their share of the spotlight James Dawkins is one of those talented people just such a good guy works so hard at what he does what passion he has 9 minutes left second quarter heat in front here in OKC by 10 T larsson's in for the first time tonight for the heat three on the shot clock heith lobbing for the we slam but the heat getting inside repeatedly tonight John I love it the pain attacks have been outstanding right now 28 points in the pain just 16 uh for the Thunder and Miami really getting in there off the dribble more often than not he shooting 59% that's Hartenstein where it turned his head Hartenstein able to score his second basket of this quarter the Miami in front 41 to 30 Tyler Herro back in the lineup after missing the last game Herro one-hander got it bottoms up for Tyler Herro he has eight points here in the first half Miami in front by a dozen Jalen Williams zigzagging to the free throw line out to Williams Pella Larson switches on to him he gets dislodged but foul now down he went Scott Foster going to call it against Miami it's going to be on heith number two on Haywood look look at Tyler Herro operating here finding the dive cutter Haywood heith it was T Tyler being double team Haywood gets to the middle of the floor and then excellent touch and awareness to look to the back line and glob it over the top to to Ware just in case you needed reminding the heater playing a team that has the best record in the league at 43 and9 n they are 24 and3 at home that's the best home record in the league J they've won 18 of their last 19 at home they have six straight wins on their home court the six straight wins are by an average margin of 26 points per game they've been that dominated look at the the best records in the league OKC in Cleveland just a a half game apart what a race Jen if if I'm guessing I think it might come down Oklahoma City and Denver to decide who comes out of the West yeah it's look I I think there's so many teams that are excelling at a high level right now when you look at Cleveland and and OKC and they're doing in the regular season the big test is going to be when they get down at the end of the year and have to get it done in the playoffs Thunder swept New Orleans last year in the first round got eliminated by Dallas in round two in a six-game series they're ready for the next job Burks oh beautiful drive by bur who got clubbed down and foul he got a chance at a three-point BL yeah land on the small of his back does most of his work out Beyond The Arc and from long range this time gets inside here great finish using the backboard and one opportunity for Alec Burks right now he's got five points on two of three shooting about four rebounds for him oldfashioned three-point play for Alec Lou Dort picking up the foul Alec Burks really efficient signing by Pat Riley and Andy ellisburg in that basketball side of the heat operation Burks Johan a guy that he' have admired for years it's his 14th season in the league one of those true Pros he he could sit 10 games in a row you call his name he's going to come in and be ready about 44% from three coming off a game where he went three of five from three against Boston he just continues to stay ready Williams has had an impact got seven points off the Thunder bench has a chance at a three-point you know he's such a big guy at 67 but he can gain speed getting downhill and able to use the backboard there with the lay and Williams in eight minutes has been able to score seven points for the th Burks picking up his second foul here'll come out but just gave Eric spoler 12 very solid minutes with the six points and four rebounds so it's Daven Mitchell T Larson Aaron Wiggins Haywood heith and Bam Adebayo on the court for the Heat three-point play for kenrich Williams average is just under six points per game this year got eight tonight beat ahead by 11 Wiggins on the pitch heith missing the rainbow triple rebound batted out taken by Davion Mitchell approaching seven minutes left in the half Wiggins deflected almost stolen by Aaron wiggers both teams have had trouble shooting the three tonight the Thunder one out of eight the heat one out of six i' like this timeout here by coach SPO which is 3.6 seconds on the shot clock wants to make sure his team is organized coming out of this timeout to be able to get a quality look like they're going to start getting some energy there's been response which we really haven't seen consistently from miam but they're shooting 62% from the field OKC is going to you better expect them to pick up the defensive intensity you might be out of this timeout now yeah we know these last few minutes are going to be tough for Miami but they've got this lead we'll continue to enjoy it with Eric and John Amy and I'll see you back heat half time present it by your South Florida Chevy dealers it's good what a play coming out of the timeout Eric spula took the timeout maximize that possession yeah you are not kidding that's why I love the timeout call by coach spoler and look how about the team coming out and executing that plan to Perfection seven points for Wiggins 13-point lead for the Heat this is Burstein against yich challenge the shot bam hustles to the rebound what a half this has been for the heat Keep It Coming guys Wiggins versus Wiggins power his way to the goal for the score nine points in the first half for Aaron Wiggins in the Heat lead by 15 matching their biggest lead of the game I love the way he's attacking inside using that length in the post coach SP featuring him down there Dort out to Jay duck that's Aaron Wiggins that's no good rebound of Pella lson they're one for nine from three excellent blocking out too lson an open three Adebayo first score of the game for Bella Larson his 17th triple of the Year puts the heat in front by 18 seven straight points from Mayan this is Dort shoots the three and misses Wiggins was caught committing the foul holding Williams so Aaron Wiggins that's unfortunate that's his third foul I think it's on it's on Jovic actually pulling that on Jovic on William I think they gave that foul to to Jovic yes that's that's better news for Miami that's the first on Jovic Wiggins for Miami just two fouls Joe back in so is Jalen Williams the Arkansas version five and a half minutes left second quarter the heat in front by 18 Joe good pump fake now fires the three he missed it they're one for 11 from three they get it back on the Dork Steel Aaron Wiggins gets by Aaron Wiggins impressive left hand stretch out there uh by Aaron Wiggins who's played extremely well over the last six games averaging 23 points for the thunder coming off the Ben here's Lon eight on the shot clock for Nikola Jovic working against Joe the Double K bam weak side pass for Marson three that was good team ball movement for the the heat they just missed an open shot lud hands it off to Aaron Wiggins Alexander from deep and Bam Adebayo tracks it down five boards for bam one for 12 three-point shooting for the Thunder you got to you got to Feast while the food's on the table Mitchell open three Kaboom Davion Mitchell with his 43rd triple of the Season his first three in a heat uniform he's got nine points the Heat lead by 19 biggest lead of the game that's a big one too for Mitchell he gets fouled right there trying to get over the screen heat in control right now but Mitchell making that three that's the shot that if he can make will really change his trajectory uh in regards to his ability to score the ball because he is going to be open there's a double team they're helping off Mitchell and he makes them pay with that dagger right there beyond the AR J Jalen

going to the rim you know you want to sell this a little bit the Thunder of the best team in the league defending the paint they only give up 42 and a half points a game in the paint they heat already with 36 let's pause for a quick word from Dural Kia Durell Kia is loaded with over 500 new Kia models in stock NOW test drive a new 25 Kia Sportage today Dell Kia drive for Less Drive dur been a productive half for bam Adebayo 15 points five rebounds three assists the Heat have a 20o lead 60 to 40 Joe hands it off it's Wiggins he missed it the rebound taken by bam now the heat up 20 with the ball Jovic from Deep short Shai killed just Alexander a 10-point first half all in the first quarter got two right there a dozen for the league scoring leader Miami in front by 18 Davion Mitchell in and out of the pain he's a ball distributor on that end Wiggins using bam screen for a 15-footer another terrific screen set by the captain Here Comes Dort Jovic is back Dort and that's a turnover on the Thunder Oklahoma City with her seventh turnover of the half heat just so good suffocating the drivers dord making a pass under pressure and throwing it way too low bouncing right off one of his teammates legs there he done done a really good job of taking away the some of the strengths of Oklahoma City on the offens and then attacking on their own going at the paint over and over again ball moves that's Wiggins out of the corner coming up short two minutes left in the second quarter Dort for three Lou Dort he's got 111 triples on the year that's his first one tonight eight points for him off their bench Herro good shot fake sends it out Jovic back to Wiggins Jovic had the shot now he takes it bam back Taps but right to Caruso Alex Caruso leaning in Jovic called for the foul be the second on NOA Jovic fourth team foul on he fou Jovic by the way has missed all four of his triples tonight the he just three out of 12 from downtown yeah he made clean contact on the ball but he he made contact with the body and that's where the foul was Caruso just put the brakes on and lean right into the big man John Alex Caruso a well-traveled eight-year veteran at a college station Texas played at Texas A&M they acquired him from the Bulls in June for Josh giddy this a guy that that's won in a lot of different places well he's a he's just an excellent Defender and he makes winning plays for the career high 1 Point seven steals a game this season he was in top 10 defensive player of the year voting a season ago I mean that's his identity so he fits in well with this team bam with the slam on a gorgeous lob from Tyler Herro that's the third dunk tonight for bam Adebayo who has 17 first half points Herro with another Nifty setup yeah he's got four assists now Tyler going over the top drawing so much attention and able to find bam on the back line and that's an illegal screen set by the Thunders lug against Dort Dort picks up his second foul Davion Mitchell is picking these illegal screens up he is a badger out there on the ball so hard Nos and he is getting chopped out front as a result and Dort moving and stepping in there to make that contact here's the oop again as bam goes hard to the basket on a dive cut and Tyler delivering again going to his right hand right over the top Tyler Herro and the Heat playing at a high level in these first two quarters herro driving through drew the hand check f d picks up another one that's number three on lugan Stewart he going to come off the bench with heith as Tyler Herro gets set for a couple of free throws we're going to see Dort coming off the floor herein and and Jalen Williams Santa Clair will come in yeah their starter Dort with three fouls not going to risk a fourth Miami 11 for 16 at the free throw strike Jovic comes out heith steps in for the heat John think about this against this a Heat team that has been held under 90 points in backto back games for the first time in in a few years and here they got 63 on the board against the number one defensive team in the NBA Hey look it's been a magical half for Miami but there're so much basketball left to play I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here Aaron Wiggins with a nice finish six points for him 14o lead for the heat yeah you got to play a full game to beat anybody in this league much less a team of Oklahoma City's caliber Thunder with just three losses at home all season two of them to the Dallas Mavericks matter three of their nine losses this year have come to Dallas and in all three games the Mavericks were without the recently traded Luca donic we'll talk more about that tomorrow night when we're in Dallas four on the shot clock Kusa sends it out to Wiggins just got it off and Bam comes down with a loose ball rebound love the scrambling defense take the ball out of the hands of The multip Talented Jay Gilgeous Alexander that's what the heat do double teaming him trying to put the the ball somewhat other option hereo lobbing somewhere between a lob and a shot and the Thunder get it back P lson just a little late trying to make a play on that lob from Tyler six heat turnovers in the half 3 seconds left in the half Gilgeous Alexander got it a big three for momentum for them a 15-point first half for Gilgeous Alexander an 11-point lead at the half for Miami so the Oklahoma City Thunder trying to defend their home court Miami played brilliantly 59% shooting for the heat 17.7 boards for bam we'll see you for the second half your halftime with Will and Amy comes up next Oklahoma City tonight in Dallas against the average tomorrow night well you you had to like what you saw out of the heat through those first two quarters toe to- Toe with the NBA's best team pound for pound a 63. half on 59% shooting with the it's good to see and it's good to see you Eric Reed with John karate let's take first let's start off with our GRE Goose top performers each team had one Shai Gilgeous Alexander for the Thunder bam Adebayo for the heat they both had terrific first half Skil just Alexander with 10 of those points in the first quarter he did a lot of damage from the free throw strike bam good all over 17 points seven boards three assists he's already got three slam dunks and John early on in this game Eric spoler made a point to get Aaron Wiggins untracked early yeah I love the positions that he was putting him in to get him activated first from the wing running side pick and roll let him get downhill to be able to use his athleticism going to the basket then the ability uh to work in the post and and if he had a size Advantage get to that middle draw fouls get himself to the free throw line we saw some ability to back screen here and quick chase the ball down to get to this jump shot on a short clock that was very well executed and then isolate just let him go one-on-one again using his natural athleticism to finish at the basket so good work by by Wiggins uh in the first half nine points on three of six shooting for Aaron yeah look at look at that bottom line 38 points in the paint for the Heat against the best paint defense in the NBA that's a season high for points in the paint in one half that's great work by Miami Wiggins and Adebayo and Ware up front out rebounding the thunder in the first half by seven but you got to play a full game to beat a team as good as Oklahoma City heat back to their starting group Herro Wiggins Adebayo Ware and Herro double team on Alexander this is Aaron Wiggins third quarter just getting started that's Jalen Williams He misses the three run down by Herro but they're four out of 17 from three Miami went three of 12 in the first half from three Tyler her had nine first half points so did Aaron Wiggins who drives in Euro Step draws the foul and that that's going to be the third foul tonight on gilgas Alexander and J you got to like the way Wiggins is operating taking it right at sgf this little screen here too right beforehand with K coming over um right before the attack let's go back here just a little bit of a bump here it it puts Shai Gilgeous Alexander in a much tougher position to defend and wiggin's able to kind of catch him by surprise with that burst there and draw the foul and get him to the line so it makes it a lot easier for Wiggins to create when you have all that activity going on around you and Kil LW coming out and and making that contact as a Defender as a player you're your heads down on a swivel you quickly turn and that's when Wiggins is able to get around and and draw the foul Aaron Wiggins makes the second of two so he's in double figures with 10 he had 11 against Boston in his heat debut a couple nights ago the heat with a 12-point lead we're in the first minute of the second half Jalen Williams that's Gilgeous Alexander covered by B wing jumper is off rebound to kle where that's where Size Matters for Miami inside and out Davion to the goal for the score Davion Mitchell attacking the baset and a timeout taken by the thumbnail a technical foul has been assess to Davion Mitchell that's crazy he's showing a motion here on the quick burst look at the S the speed right here able to get to the basket that Mitchell clearly wanted a foul he let the officials know and Carl Lane teed him up Chris do not miss black Excellence night at the heat house coming up February 26th against the Atlanta Hawks scan that QR code you to purchase some great seats right now now the technical on Davion Mitchell was missed by Shai Gilgeous Alexander for for Davion Mitchell maybe a little bit too vocal after what he thought was a foul on a score he's got three Career technical fouls they've all come this season B don't like Heat lead by 14 a minute 10 into the third quarter hartenstein against whale out it comes and KH where he can protect the basket six on the shot clock Jalen Williams back to Gil just Alexander that's not really his game ball will go back to Miami so the Thunder continue to struggle from downtown they're four out of 18 I love the way the heat are controlling the board too they're out rebounding on the thunder right now they've been able to keep Hartenstein in check he's only got three boards remember he had 18 the last time the two teams faced each other he had five offens of rebound oh bam tried to lob it to Ware instead it'll go down as a field goal attempt Kel'el was fouled on his attempt at a put back and Shake hilis Alexander is picking up his fourth personal foul lob action here I think Bam Bam was motioning that he threw a tried to throw a lob to to kle there but kle did the right thing let it hit the rim first and then tried to make a play he have hurt themselves uh from the free throw stripe they've missed seven of their 20 free throws tonight GL been quiet offensively lately 8 for 27 over his previous three games just one for two toight he's got five points and five rebounds Miami in front by 15 67 the 52 Aaron Wiggins guarded by Aaron Wiggins d from the dotted line L Dort with 10 points tonight for the Thunder he had 14 in the Thunders win in Miami back in late December a couple minutes into the third quarter long road still the track but hea played remarkably well tonight Dam on Mitchell six on the shot clock for Herro step back three he had to shoot that one a long way that is Herro's first three-point attempt of the game Gilgeous Alexander guarded by Mitchell could not get a shot off Jalen Williams does and the rebound to Bam that's his eighth rebound of the game def Davion Metro will settle down the he runs him offense here with a 13-point lead seven on the shot clock Herro looking for space finds bam lobs for where he put it in off the glass oh big assisting big Miami now up by 15 again great high low action there bam and Ware connected right there on that lob we challenge the shot but Jalen Williams Jalen Williams able to score that's his seventh point of the game yeah really nice touch on the fade away there using that 66 height Davion Mitchell Kaboom Davion Mitchell he's tripled twice tonight he's got 14 points in the game for Miami and he's done it on six of seven shooting yeah that three-point shot will change his game can't help off him if he's that efficient out there that's another goodl looking bucket for Jalen Williams that's why he's going to the allstar game this year nine points for him Miami in front by 14 heat already with 42 points in the paint Herro a wing three and from behind kept it alive Mitchell sends it up air ball Wiggins could not save it in successfully he have not shot well from the free throw line or from three-point land yet they're 56% from the field overall their two-point game and their point in the paint game has been terrific just under 8 minutes left third quarter a 14-point Heat lead Jalen Williams rejected by kle W that's his first block of the game pretty play bam try to get through traffic could not here come the Thunder Gilgeous Alexander out to Aaron Wiggins got it a line drive home run for Aaron Wiggins his first three of the game now they're able to take advantage of Miami's turnover to have numbers coming down the floor driving kick action and Aaron Wiggins has given them the big lift in these last six games or so Off the Bench bam at a B call for a moving screen that's going to be his second foul all of a sudden the home team and the home crowd are re-engaged bam on the left side here trying to get Taylor Tyler open leaning to his left and taking l d Joe into the game for Lou D

back to Jay Williams now Shai Gilgeous Alexander against W is oh he got kicked by Jovic inadvertently and Jovic is hurt oh my well terrible play for Jovic who is clutching at his left hamstring I think he hit his hamstring or his knee right there we're going to get a time out both players are hurt oh a shot right to the jaw of Joe that would be a close out not under control for Gilgeous Alexander a frustrating play in then on both ends for Nikola fou on the floor we check to see if it meets the criteria for a flagrant foul a break in the action with 1029 left here on the fourth quarter back of his left leg there as he spins in the air it's his thigh and right behind his left knee he was not anticipating obviously Joe stepping through there either EO clearly in paint still on the bench being looked at by training staff yeah the the officials on the headsets conferring with the replay Center in this instance you're you're looking to judge the close out was it under control or or was it a reckless close out the officials were huddled up they're done with their conference on the headsets here we go after review it seemed that the offens player up faked the defender into the air while he was in midair the offens player went underneath and it was unfortunate that the contact occurred but it was not a windup impact follow through it's not a play foul he te to Common foul side out I like the adjective unfortunate unfortunate it was unfortunate contact and clearly not planned because Jovic actually might may have gotten the worst of this Joe able to able to run off the floor Nikola Jovic has left the game and he is going to be going to the locker room right now he's walking back slowly now he will go to the end of the batch excuse me yich sits with 11 points and four assists hella Larson is in back to a cut Gilgeous Alexander scores easily he's got 23 he got a two-point game in a game the Thunder had not LED in not a single lead change tonight yet oh the steel bite Dort took it away from Herro and scor 15 for Dort we got our first tie of the game it comes at 93 you see the physicality ramping up on the defensive end gor on the ball putting that pressure on Tyler Burks deep in the corner for Miami with 10 on the shot clock poor spacing got to get out of that corner five the shoot Burks steps in miss it rebound to Jalen Williams of Oklahoma City Thunder looking for their first lead of the night 26 for Shai Gilgeous Alexander he's got eight in the fourth quarter comfort zone three Highsmith playing hard drive stepping back with that left hand and he lets it rip from Beyond The Arc like always brought to upai Ocean B if you were with us early you were smiling in that first quarter when he scored 35 points got 13 from bam in the first

straight points to open the fourth quarter we got 920 left in the game Miami for the first time trailing Wiggins comes up short the heater down by three John now it's a matter of executing against the most ferocious defense in the NBA a defense that has plugged itself back into the game yeah they're really dialed in they've got the crowd totally engaged right now playing on their home floor where

better than 50% shooting that's remarkable Wiggins out to Mitchell back to B missed the 17 footer Heat trailing by five is the biggest thunder lead of the game do now Joe Joe the Thunder 16 to nothing here in the fourth quarter what a blitz right now Miami has got to find an answer here good hard take Joe on the reach in but this calls for Tyler herro getting involved in some kind of pick and roll action maybe a down screen for Wiggins coming from the weak side of the floor where they can get something off the ball and and some movement because it's so stagnant right now for Miami offensively so 18 straight points for the Thunder Down 18 Herro missing on the three bam down with his 12 rebound Mitchell from the corner can get it rebound to kenrich Williams well the heat hav't scored yet in the fourth quarter the Thunder with 18 points in the fourth quarter 10 of them from this man IAH Joe this is Dort and B grabs another one Mitchell on the moon Tyler here trying to find where it's

at what coach SP was upset about Burks out Herro in saying he wasn't gathered I looked like he was on his way up there's depends on where they call it looked like the ball slipped out of his hands that did not look like a shot the only positive as you get Tyler Herro in the game cuz Burks wasn't shooting Wiggins lobing bam crushing nice set up by Wiggins bam has had a terrific game tonight 27 points 13 rebounds I love the way he's been going to the basket too obviously the lob dunks have been on point but his ability to drive too and attack off the dribble in and out and here comes Nikola

contact between Adebayo and Shai Gilgeous Alexander the call goes against Miami it has been a rough fourth quarter a lot of turbulence here in ok KC late again since one rebound one game one step at a time he's approaching a franchise record that has been in existence for 30 years that's the last time cyle played for the Heat played Seven Seasons for the heat the first seven years and Bam with his 29th double double this year is just one double double away from tying a franchise record that has lasted for three decades the BAM slam bam Adebayo tonight I have him unofficially for six dunks he's 11 of 18 from the field 27 points 13 rebounds four assists that Captain has done his job but but John the heed have been outscored here in the fourth quarter as you look at your keia player profile on the heat Captain 28 to8 in the fourth quarter hard yes really tough to overcome just over 3 minutes got to dig in here it really get stops margin of is so tight right now Miami can't afford to make mistakes Wiggins driving on Burks no finish Bam gets another rebound 245 to play Burks look Wiggins looking for room that's Burks for Herro see how close the spacing is there and they just take advantage they eat you alive when you get too many bodies on one side of the Flor well that's what they do they force more turnovers and score more points off turnovers than any team in the league they also lead the NBA in steals deflections charges drawn you name it on the defensive end they're best in the business Act 10 on the shot CL Aaron wiggins Aaron Wiggins sh rebound to Aaron Wiggins two minutes we got 2 minutes left in this game Miami just three for 14 shooting in the fourth quarter Jalen Williams not that time and another rebound for Burks Burks with 11 points and nine rebounds tonight the nine rebounds are his season High minute 40 to play Burks got hammered by Dort no call Shai oh what a finish for Alexander 32 points for Shai Gilgeous Alexander we got 14 points here in the fourth quarter he is been every bit the top score in the league the way he's closed here in the fourth Tyler Herro short from three Herro tonight that's one for six from downtown heat held the eight fourth quarter points on three of 16 shooting and you could fault the heat offense but you also better give credit to the best defense in the NBA they had a lot to do with it yeah I mean look really impressive what a close for this team in the fourth quarter OKC just came alive and showed why they've got the best record uh in the west Burks missing the three you know the Thunder have this is going to be their they've had 36 35 games where they've outscored the opponent by at least 10 points this could be their 30 six double figure win of the Season which is also tops in the leop fans started on their feet they're going to end the game out of their seats on their feet tonight bam Adebayo coming down with his 15th rebound to the game but the heater down by 14 18 seconds left Adebayo missing the three and the Thunder will improve their record to 44 and N they'll go to 25 and three at home and John how about this 19 and one against teams from the East their only loss was a seven-point loss at Cleveland back in early January they do it with a dynamic fourth quarter they have scored the heat 32-8 in the fourth quarter ties the heat second L lowest ties the Heat's lowest fourth quarter of the season they were held at eight points in a December 21st loss at Orlando in the fourth quarter they get out scored 32 to8 tonight in the fourth quarter they were able to make just three of 18 shots in the final period with six turnovers the he just could not execute against the League's most suffocating defense Miami loses its third straight game they dropped two games
