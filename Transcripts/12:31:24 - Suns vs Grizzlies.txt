 27 season 204 playoff games 21 finals games fenasy Ransom 7th NBA season JD RWS in his first NBA season glad you're with us on the final day of 2020 Scotty Pippen Jr the battle of the Ja Morant backups Beal denied and here come the Grizzlies Bane straight line drive finger row got by formly antias Jones Bane a 22-point game Sunday at Oklahoma City one thing to besid they'll allow you to score some points and The Grizzlies great job there getting out in transition scoring before the sun set up their defense suns have lost five of six pled Saturday at Golden State lost 109 105 Booker's elbow jumper is off this is a phoenix team Brean they rely very heavily on the mid-range jump shot because the three guys that you were talking about that are their Allstar is Jaren doesn't get that one to fall Bradley Bill Devin Booker and Kevin Durant all mid-range players Plumlee running in flid sets up tyus Jones for three and Desmond Bane wipes out Plumlee and an early foul for Desmond Bane and that could prove important because Aon Jackson J really none of these guys really partner with nine players nobody can get into early foul trouble good steal here steal by Pippen against Tyus would have counted but if early foul on Tyus Jones and Pippen 14 which is a bit of a head scratcher given that Mike buer is well known as a very good defensive coach problem is though you got three offensive players that's in your starting lineup so you talking about yes Kevin Durant is a can be a second siiz shot blocker I think Devin Booker and Bradley Bill will give efforts John Durant did try to rival Rob fiser but you have three of those three of your five guys are guys who have seen as more as scorers than Defenders and they're without nage because of a league mandated suspension after a frus and that's a that's a big body ties Joe with the floater the pat it going to his left right hand floater by Tyus Grizzlies have been attacking Mason Plumlee early with success Jaren yes and the foul again another team and he has converted all but one and one opportunity this season and The Grizzlies an early 9-2 lead now the scored the first nine at Oklahoma City I think Oklahoma City won a N n0 Run themselves as Booker misses there and lose ball foul on Plumlee that's two on him and go right back at Plumlee Konchar dotted line Jaren floater got it Jaren Jackson Jr and an early timeout Mike buzer calls for thomon after their first basket which was a floater we got down the floor and we scored within 6 seconds he said that's a mentality we got to play tonight Beal Corner three popped out ISO Ighodaro is in as Plumlee has to sit with the two early fouls let's see defensively if they change their philosophy because of a different Defender now on Jaren Jaren encounters Durant and then throws it out of bounds we said in our Pinnacle effective advice of the game we talked about it foul there on Jaylen Wells allowing dein Booker to get through the screen we talking about get a shot every time down the floor whether they make it they do a good job attacking attacking the offensive glass but it also just gives you a chance to get back defensively the turnovers means you're going to be unbalanced there they another careless turnover there by the sun with the turnover Booker with a skip pass Tyus Jones picked up by Pippen andaro setting the screen for Tyus and Konchar pushing Durant he Phoenix team and losing five of six they're allowing 113 points per game and 47% shooting Tyus with a floated from the Baseline Tyus Jones with four Tyus averaging 12 and a half a game yes and the foul that's the second time that Desmond Bane has been able to get a Bas the free throw line Bane last year against Phoenix averaged 18.7 a game but he missfires on the free throw rebound to Durant Jones guarded by Bane and Bane with the knock away two tle with a Tyus we would go games with without getting two turnovers from Tyus Wells on the Baseline picked up by Booker Jaren spins got to the cup yes and the foul a second and one opportunity for Jaren Jackson and both guys doing a fantastic job to start it big bounceback game for Jaren can't convert to free throw however struggled against Oklahoma City but you know a lot of really good offensive players have struggled against Oklahoma City this year and a lot will continue Booker short with the three rebound Wells Booker starts 0 for three Wells lost it picked up by Beal Booker and ban has to let him go didn't want to pick up a second foul those are the turnovers that you're talking about you saying when you are when you are driving and going with a purpose Sharon has been purposeful the entire night third double figure first quarter this year for Jaren Jackson Jr he's got a 11 five of six shooting Durant against conar Ighodaro with the hook off glass also Ighodaro out of Marquette native of Chandler Arizona with the score and tipping the turnover partner the these turnovers are they got to be better transition take foul and so Booker at the line for a free throw and possession for Phoenix bluk Kennard into the game for the Grizzlies Scotty Pippen Jr will go to the bench and The Grizzlies already four turnovers leading at the fastest Pace in the NBA so there's a greater volume of possessions but it it just seems that sometimes they're almost playing too fast and as a result they're turning it over second foul on Bane there going to be some some possessions in times where you may have to give up a basket because you cannot pick up another foul and that especially goes for Dez and jar cam Spencer the rookie L of you comp were very high they are under 500 the latest in a season for the first time since the 2019 2020 NBA season Mike Brer in his first season here big success in Atlanta in Milwaukee Taylor Jenkins an assistant under Brun hoer in both of those stops tend to shoot for Jaren no double team Kennard gives it back a Jaren triple it's in Jaren Jackson Jr a 14-point first quarter allar Jaren Jackson Jr playing like it on a nightly basis vote early and often Ighodaro misses the floater rebound Jackson cam Spencer thought about it Wells on the Baseline wrap around Kennard lays it in nicely done by the rookie Jaylen Wells yeah good D good drive to be in a position to be an outlet for him on that drive Jones guarded by Kennard Suns just five of 13 from the floor Ighodaro well the thing is that not S I give him credit he was fronting Durant on the interior they tried to flash High to go over the top but Jaren didn't allow it Force the short shot five remaining in the first quarter cam Spencer good ball movement body movement Spencer flashes to the middle of the lane and The Grizzlies their largest lead of the night 2413 Taylor mentioned it we talked about on the pregame show in terms of all of these guys have gone through the same regiment all season of what they want to get accomplished late foul Beal goes down down and Beal grizzley seven assists on 10 baskets and Beal at the free throw line both teams are over the limit Beal 77% from the line on the season Monte Morris in along with Ryan Dunn but a little bit similar to kaminga in terms of being able to the way that they run the floor way they able to to make plays Above the Rim as the play bypl boys to the Phoenix Suns passed away one of the many great ones we lost in 2024 Jaren with a rare Miss Grizzlies start 10 of 13 offensively they have gotten what they've wanted and they have produced Durant got by well snuck inside overlaid it and they're going to say it's Phoenix ball 10 on the shot clock for the Suns coming back in Durant Durant averaging just under 28 a game averaging 33 a game in the last half dozen he and deal really picked up the scoring slack with Booker out for five games Jaren contact yes a third and one chance for Jaren Jack quter Unstoppable has been Jaren 17 of the Grizzlies 27 uodo and plumly both with two fouls now and again no use of nage because of the suspension Jaren beating Suns by himself by one Monte Morris a fade away Jumper rebounded by Kennard Phoenix just 35% from the floor Kennard against Ighodaro Konchar blocked out of bounds stays with the Grizzlies eight on the shot clock determined that the ball was last touched by Memphis and there were no was no approximate fou therefore that is a successful challenge by Phoenix Memphis will remain being charged for the timeout and Phoenix has an additional challenge points Jaren 17 points the Suns 16 points good defense here early by this Grizzlies team good knock away there by Wells Wells with the overplay against Durant Beal in the lane floater is in for Bradley Beal limited to just 53 games a year ago due to injury Jackson against Dunn backs him down Kennard not a clean catch Spencer for three short Durant a tap rebound but he steps out of pounds and The Grizzlies get it back in for Phoenix for the first time tonight Jaren drives on Durant Andrew a foul it's on Durant and Jaren back to the free throw line Mike booer can't believe it care for it's his first foul and Jaren an 18-point first quarter so you know my mom works a lot differently partner than a lot of people yes we know this so I know you guys say that was you think that was push but what I'm going to say is the Grizzlies play aggressive defense and if that is going to be a foul then the Grizzlies are going to get those type fouls they don't have the players to get those type fouls called against them so hopefully they're able to play and not have any subtle pushes or anything like that on their end Durant with a driving finish and a foul see what I'm saying Parton yep is my standing free throw shooter 8 4% this season now eighth on the alltime NBA scoring list and he converts they didn't they missed a sub they didn't let they had a sub at the table Scotty Pitman Jr but they never subed him in the game Jaren loses it is able to save Jay huff and a loose ball foul is called on Phoenix loose ball foul Mike buer his face drawing ever rder and Kennard good with the first the good thing for this Grizzy team the difference is quarter Kennard pushes the lead back to 10 Pippen back into the game so it's Kennard Huff Pippen Jackson and Konchar Beal drives Fade Away off the glass around and out boarded by Huff Huff a 17-point game against the Thunder on Sunday Jaren has the mismatch against Beal out of the double A Kennard three it's great ball movement though that job by Jaren got it out of the double quickly Scotty PPP Jr another Quick Pass you take blue canar with a dead straight look all night Grizz overplay by Jaren Beal bumps him hands to Huff he lays it in grizz's converting off turnovers and then the assist to H run grizzli six fast break points already 12-point lead Memphis is largest a kog lines up a three it's the first three-point make for the Suns who are fifth in the league shooting 38% from distance final minute of the first quarter it's been Jaren Jackson Jr dominating Kennard against Monte Morris Huff set that's his feed for three Bango J Hof great find by Kennard better screen set by Scotty Pippen Jr to allow the flare to be there Monte Morris drives and the reverse layup is home nice little crossover dribble move there turn Luke Kennard around Morris able to finish Grizzlies 68% shooting Jaren with 19 in the quarter drives on Dunn and then commits an offensive foul after he released the pass Tyus Jones back in the game for Phoenix Tyus 5 Seconds remain in the period backs down against Kennard Kennard knocked it away and off of Tyus Pippen from half court good of it goes off the top of the board Plumlee Booker Dunn Morris  Okogie for the Suns Bane Pippen Spencer huff and Colin Castleton for the Grizzlies these will be those important minutes Des bang nice flash good rebound by Spencer with important minutes for the Grizzlies can they sustain with Jaren on the bench Huff three-point Miss Long rebound out to Booker three-pointer from distance Booker after a slow start five straight Spencer's three short and loose ball foul called on Huff game warning has been issued against Phoenix Phoenix a delay of game warning the Phoenix team they started great 9-2 averaging 115 points per game in their last 20 games they're six and 14 they're averaging Five Points fewer per game the problem with that is that offensively they have those numbers have not increased on the offensive end to make up for the defensive numbers Booker hoping for a foul got none Pippeng on a run out 103 Phoenix run Grizzly's trying to respond Huff an open green back iron and then Spencer a foul foul from the 24 gam Spencer his first personal second team foul Suns basketball said offense is going to be at a premium at this juncture and of course you would like to rely on Desmond Bane as being the go-to player on the floor but for everyone else see if the Grizzlies still can move the ball well and get good clean looks if you're going to shoot threes but don't abandon any type Drive yeah the Grizzlies were 10 of 12 shooting in the painted area in that first quarter I know a lot of that was trip of course Dunn short with a three got his own Miss out of bounds off the Griz see if Booker tries to take this game over hogi got by huff and laid it in and The Grizzlies call time lead's gone from 12 to3 in short order it was the second quarter that was a huge problem in Oklahoma City around the room yeah that is a an absolutely great point he's got five here is five minutes here is Bane back on the floor and a quick catch and shoot three able to knock it down turns into the transition opportunity here for Bane Bane of the drive gets the Finish really good at it and he uses his body cuz he knows that most guys can out jump him and and mess with his shot he's very good using that body to Ward him off got a 90 run to two buckets from Bane that pass stolen away Morris Taps it off of the leg of aobi back to Booker lines up the three no tapped away inside Spencer's got it pass up the floor now of Pippen colin Castleton out there now seconde man out of Florida the offensive foul yeah Bane got those five quick points the three and then the lay in Morris with Spencer draped all over him across Dunn Tapped Out Plumlee couldn't control B got it on the push got the inside position on that though he's got to stop P for three yeah those are the ones that you've got to fight your way to Hooker off the screen fires a three fouled on the three-point attempt by Pippen Jr and and so Booker at the free thr yeah send them to the line for three B able to knock down the first game with no fees hurry Italian suon down here sitting next to me with my loose suit on Bane outside he's got nine Jaren Jackson Jr leading their SC scoring attack with 19 currently on the bench Pippen Junior's got it Spencer shot clock at three Bane with the pump fake knocks it down he's got a dozen shoting team 13th in the league at 36% Hun's got it on the driveing kick Jones back to  Okogie J on the drive hung up inside mace has it drops it off inside Dunn right into good passing right there well and that's the kind of movement and cutting that Memphis was hurting the sun with early m b dribbling off of bodies gets inside for the floater he has come to life here in this second quarter in the absent of Jackson Jr but that that's the game plan I mean he and Jackson Jr as you said before they're going to take most of the shots 10 of his 14 have come here in the second quarter Booker on the drive inside again they are letting body up Pippa Jr on the driveing kick out the Huff he has shown that he is a willing three-point shooter knocks down another one te have come here in the second quarter he and Jaren Jackson Jr have combined to go 13 of 17 from the field 35 of their 49 points Sun keep it alive with the offensive rebound Kevin Durant inside another back tap Tyus fires a pass to cross the floor to an open shooter and Devin Booker won't get it J on the offensive glass again the Konchar rips it away and you love The Hustle but as J went up that ball came over leaned up here is Bane at 22 their loss on Sunday to OKC 130 to 106 this has been one of the hottest teams in the month of December B the drive won't get that pull up Huff fighting for the offensive rebound and he he has a breath of fresh air here he he can rest him as long as they're nursing with this 10 11 point lead he's not going to bring him back if he does he's bringing him back because Jaren Jackson is upset that he's not Jones on the drive inside kind of half shot half lob yeah I thought he also thought he was going to lob it to him B on the driveing Kick K up from the corner won't get it Kevin Durant with a loose ball rebound up the FL and out of Booker no look dish shogi lands at home that's speed right there Josh Okogie turned on the Jets H fires a quick three Konchar with the back tap and they're going to get it f Jackson Jr back on the floor wees all scores with 19 kind of flash a double then they drop off cont shark quick trigger and he delivers the last wedgie perhaps of 2020 bad teou call get a free throw yeah get a wedgie all wedgie should provide you a free throw makes everybody feel better delay a game that's what he was see get another chance they 24 second Dale Wells back out of the floor now rookie out of Washington State well trying to drive it inside cut off there by Booker B quick release left it short again great on ball defense by Josh Okogie Booker up the floor drops it off to the trailing dur Ranch sticks the three now this is an important 445 here yeah it is Sun's down by six it's him one and done good defense there and forc the Hand of Konchar won't get that three look working on Konchar Morant most times CU most defenses sink down below and he's able to get a great shot miscommunication on the inbound Sun's turnover Bane trailing gets a shoulder into Jones angle of a pass like you know even when you're receiving the pass you got to really like get to an angle make sure you cut the defender off and then go get the ball give the passer a Target it's those actions man that guarantee that you don't turn it over and it takes a little effort to do it B one of two but more importantly that's a third foul on Tyus D slip screen drops it off now to a Okogie in heavy traffic for the shot clock stuns turn it over again up the floor to Wells a away to the pass gun with great retreating defense able to get a block and in transition knocked out of bounds last touched by you know they'll feel good if they can get in this locker room and this lead is below five you know that's the Target right there and it's just being generous really CU they can be in the lead based on how much time is left K able to turn the corner great screen inside by the Suns rookie bodoro you can't do that I mean you got to get up on him make him drive he is one of the best three yeah led the NBA three-point shooting to the last three seasons lost out last season and the Suns Grayson Allen J trying to counter with his own three that one spins out Memphis six of 18 from Beyond The Arc Jackson Jr on the drive leaner inside no tapped up by Konchar yeah those are the things that just should happen and it's again like I always say how you get back in the game is you have to exert more energy than them we always see it at the end of a game when it's desperation and the game is over you see the energy well that should be the energy right now tius gets the screen gets the bucket here is Wells thought about shooting on the drive across the lane instead he'll take a tough two whistle and a foul that's going to be the fifth don't even know what to say anymore no and we saw this one grimacing and you could just see in his eyes in his face yeah that he was dealing with you can tell it's an issue and and dealt with those lower back issues last season has it been an issue this year Wells hits a three hadn't scored and then now he's got five quick points backto back buckets his first three-point hit lead back to 11 Durant dribbling past the r to get inside 14 for Kevin Durant Jackson Jr bottled up by Garo and we'll get the whistle on a foul comes with 140 to go is Damen will make his way to the scores table here along with Mason Plumlee again I mean if you get anything from this Memphis griffy team they dealt with injuries for the last few years yeah but what you saw from them is a there's a high level of effort and it was never an easy win with this team even when Ja Morant was out all those games when Jaren Jackson was out uh even Bane last year has some way of getting them to just perform at a high level and they're 22 and 11 so I think even with those guys out Marcus Smart Moantr all those doesn't matter yeah they played hard I said every single night they're going downhill on the roller coasters like so they can be able to persevere despite the injur Morris on the drive Pippen jior get a message our friends at Kia cover more ground in the Suns 10 of 12 from the line Memphis 10 of 14 see first of four meetings between these two teams and one of the other reasons why you know we put you put so much emphasis on tonight's game I had this conversation earlier today with the guys on the radio show as all of a sudden jayen Wells who didn't score the entire first quarter and a half has hit two threes had a two and all of a sudden he's got eight points he's averaging 11 on the season but you know we've seen teams take advantage of the Suns when they're compromised each that's why there's so much importance put on this one tonight because Memphis clearly compromised with missing 50 plus points and they got nine guys over there right yeah and and and so everybody over there knows that they're going to play we haven't mentioned Zach Edy who is a problem as well and he's played exceptional for them I mean it's like you know it doesn't matter who he puts on the floor Jackson Jr knocking down another triple he's got 25 here in the half and their biggest lead now at a dozen Kevin Durant lines up the three won't get it loose ball rebound snatched away by Konchar up the FL now of Kennard Bane on the drive and the figer roll finish final 10 seconds of the half D Lee deep three on the way spins out no rebound cleared by Jackson Jr 55 good Lu I thought I would have a smooth first half and I tell you they took my buzs away now now you're now you're wiing up paper and throwing it wumbly brings the boom to maybe light the fuse boo had the big second that's a travel I don't know how he got away with that well most nights it is tonight it is not normally they call that quier trying to spin away from PIV J drops it off again to on it just force it because again J Jackson Jr is not going to the game he has G and the players that's hurt they have instructed him to not be overly aggressive at times on the court to get in foul trouble ni Jones able to connect on the three sons have never LED in this one b on the side step three he won't get it that'll be a wh in that first half contined well got a good look too strong with that offering 11 points in his 16 minutes making the return after being sidelined with the going tightness Sun's able to turn him over in transition will to run the floor probing on the driveing kick Durant looks for the trailing Jones Tyus will take the elbow jumper Bo you love seeing this early for Tyus being aggressive but again I I think Tyus has to have a a portal of thinking okay you know what I got to I got to be that Catalyst Jackson Jr look up at the three won't get it ties with 15 points he's had 20 plus points twice this season I'm sure he'd love to do it against his old Club he played for Four Seasons fly on the drive gave it up with the Baseline push yeah with the rotation to ready to kick it out to the three-point Shooters I get it but man you in the you got two feet in the paint you got to look at that Rim Bane gives it up conard got it now into the corner Wells five on the shot clock wells in the drive jump stop inside but Rec there but Ryan Dunn unbelievable that's kind offf we want to see wowow Kevin Durant on the drive Konchar gets a hand KN says I counter your layup for a block after a season High 12 the Suns with just one so far here tonight mace inside again on the feed from Durant and that'll he and Bane have to stay on the floor if they're going to pull this one out well and not only that e but going back to a comment you've made on a number of occasions by mace scoring early here to start the quarter as the loose ball tapped around gathered in by Kevin Durant drops it off in transition but the Suns turn it over missing a golden opportunity pbot Jr out to Jackson Jr comes up short on that three-point ATT TI Booker was wide open but nobody had their eyes up the floor but back to the point on on mace you you allow that defense to basically defend everybody else on the floor if he's not looking to be in school college they were very aggressive scoring the ball looker working Pace line of the rookie Wells snakes inside but can't get the Finish there's Plumlee on the offensive rebound to Booker for three won't get it the hustle for Booker couldn't Corral it up the floor out of Pippen Jr on the Crossovers looks inside won't get that one done on the rebound Tyus finds Plumlee touch pass Dunn loads up the three got it in the second quarter at 3633 this is as close as they've been since then Wells on the drive and kick too strong as some of them got expanded minutes on Sunday but that is because they were trailing big in Oklahoma City Tyus on the drive won't get it there's Plumlee again in the glass but had it knocked out of his hands Luke Gard is stepped on the floor here for Memphis here is Bane at the big second quarter Kennard on the drive and kick Jackson Jr back to Kennard G Lefty with the three-point hits we relocated way all the injuries that the Grizzlies have Booker fighting off the screen and it's Wells who sent to the bench picking up his fourth personal foul inside Durant to Plumlee Jen Jackson got caught peeking there Bain 17 first half points neis turns it over again up the four to Plumlee and B punches it down he can just catch it and dish Dunn he did not want him to have to dribble it Bane outside Jackson Jr at the screen laces the three once again the Suns had gotten within three Jackson doubles it back to six he's got 28 across the floor to Booker on the Baseline Drive Bu The Whistle I hope I pronounced his name correctly ly I never want to get on an official and don't pronounce his name correctly FY it's feny look with a pair  Okogie on the floor and Dawn have been their energy igniters here tonight Bane tied up Kennard's got it goes to the right hand hung up in the air Jones nearly had the steal boy he played that beautifully but just too late in the first half has been much tighter here in this third quarter five on the shot clock he's going to shoot the jump puts it on the deck Osa with the strip Kevin Durant up ahead gets it back for Booker lays it up an in not a beautiful fast break but it executed well B shaking up the defender at Okogie fires that one won't get it offensive GL by Spencer and then just handed it off inside with the easy two igoro has it stri from behind and the crowd warned him Bane on the drive has it blocked away Kennard recovers Bane relocating on the drive the scoop the score I we experienced that in Golden State Tyus with the floater can't get the roll Jackson Jr with the rebound up the four out of Spencer Jackson Jr with a jab step drives inside with a left hand no another offensive rebound by Konchar outside Bane three-point hit to a nine-point lead rebound Kevin Durant drawing triple team attention swarmed under there then we'll get a jump ball between he and yeah they well they showed early on in that as kind of an odd tip but the Suns claim it again the double team comes J from the corner won't get it and huff is going to be whistled for the yeah if you're just tuning in Brad started tonight but played Just 12 minutes went down fell hard on his hip Monte gets the screen gets the look won't get it Konchar with a rebound Konchar only four points but he's had seven rebounds two offensive here in this quarter  Okogie forcing the adjustment on the shot by ban out to Kennard on the ball F Jackson Jr in the Baseline Drive and we'll get a block now like I said you know with Bradley Bill out Jackson obliges and misses the pair 82% free throw shooter floater inside good for Morris yeah I it Bonnie Morris has to be that guy right now he's got to take it upon himself if they're going to double Kevin Durant be active Bane on the drive gets it the more aggressive and taking the angle away from him Taylor Jenkins adjusting his light at Monte Morris Kevin Durant is going to continually tell him to stay aggressive Konchar with another rebound that is his eigh and it's not like he's a a tall guy out there puff on the drive denied by Oso up the floor J with the scoop and the score you at The Rim at the level that those two do J missing a free throw Jackson junor on the bench here the last 249 so you figure everything is going to start and likely end with Bane though Kennard figures to be a part of the action as well they got they got a foul to give here Kennard catch and shoot three no long rebound who's going to get it Morris up the floor Durant got it drops it off once again within three Berard very aggressive here haven't seen him dribble that much in his whole career yeah he was able to bait Oso into stepping out must have been hanging around James hard offard having a very good year Morris St Corner three yes again Phoenix has never LED in this game Castleton on the drive tied up by Ighodaro and a delayed whistle a rebound is grapped and then the whistle comes yeah I think Oso sometimes gets caught leaning forward defensively and he's got to get to the point where you know he's got to almost be like Chaz Roberts AC heating and plumbing Chaz Roberts ACM pluming 8784 suns have climbed within two twice they've been within three four five times Durant snakes his way inside Suns turn it Gard the jump stop thei forces the ball out of his hands back to Bane got to be ready to help on Bane he hits the brakes then hits the jumper 24 for Desmond pound away to push him right back KD's got it caught sharp right up in his waistband spash on you want yeah you don't want to burn you don't want to burn it you know here's B outside final 36 seconds with a floater well he saw him do it in the second quarter when Jaren Jackson Jr went out and he is demonstrating that same ability to score when he needs and wants to here in the late third Kevin Durant gets to the Elbow won't get it loose ball scooped up by Kennard you see Dawn Andi swiping at the basketball but the Grizzlies will get the final shot of the quarter here leading by five b to the left hand Le inside won't two on two occasions in that third quarter Jen Jackson Jr 28 Desmond ban 26 so 54 their 991 coming from their two big guns here is Wells who had a big second quarter ball tapped around back to Wells well done inside says nothing easy coming your way loose ball rebound AI up the floor to Booker man that that's great defense at The Rim some's coming through with another block party is J lonley spencer back outside now to Jackson Jr he gets away with that traval every time I I I have to look at him moving both feet before he puts the ball there 29 for Jackson Jr coming off his worst shooting performance of the season three of 17 10 of 18 tonight he said three of their 12 threes and that's the other thing they've got five more made threes that shoulder injury again they're missing Marcus SM Brandon Clark GG Jackson Zack Edey they leaded by seven pass inside to Booker can't get it mace with the inside position the foul occurred on the tip end attempt it that's what it seemed like and maybe they're calling it beforehand Morris working off the scen gets to the Baseline gets the touch like I said mon Mo got to keep here they're not trying to defend him Jackson Jr barrels over Plumlee spins inside kicks it across the floor to Pimpin Jr w'll get that one Booker leaping high for the rebound up the FL to Morris Morris with a beautiful Euro Step reverse to the basket a dozen need to remain aggressive no Bradley Beal Wells popped there by from the floor here but again five more made threes for the Grizzlies right now one of the big differences Jackson junor has hit three of them lost the handle and there's another one of those delayed whistles as bud is looking we haven't mentioned Royce O'Neal I mean just the fact that he and Bradley Beal are not on the floor that is a tough thing to deal with as well I was asked earlier today what the loss of Royce will mean now Jaren Jackson Jr and now Spencer was trying to grab the basketball out of the hands of Devin Booker and Jaren Jackson Jr now trying to get involved but Booker felt like and I thought at the moment that it was kicked on the dribble by Memphis Yeah and Spencer what he did Spencer as Devin was you know obviously trying to out of a guy's hands that's arguing and and then that's so I I didn't see it on that one we have to run it back it went off OT I couldn't tell if it was Bookers or the defender Wells well you see a push coming yeah that's off the foot of the ball the ball hit but again a so they the ball was clearly kicked so the the the league does not allow that to be challenge a double technical Spencer and Booker Suns once again within three Jackson Jr on the drive jump stop out to Spencer lines up the three won't get it long rebound back to Pippen Jr yeah right you can't rely on your athletic ability you got to block out Spencer there Castleton with knock the guy out Jackson Jr head down on the drive double team drawn dein hooker forces the tie up well I like the fact that of the gley pretty much have had a little party five on the shot clock Jackson junor tips it up Wells gathers I'm not sure he realizes the shot clock is winding down just does gets a shot off the iron and snatching it away is josh Okogie nobody was going to out jump him to the ball that time no Booker able to dribble past pipper Jr drops it off inside to Plumlee on the hesitation J on the drive dish inside the Booker on a pump lost the basketball Spencer's got it celon on the drive of the basket tied up by Plumlee and then blocked on another team foul and if you want a secure lead the Grizzlies are in a push position Virginia Wells with the pair Tyus Jones back on the floor Booker again dealing with heavy traffic on the jump or no on the drive inside Pippen Jr right at the cup but couldn't get the finish up the four out of Booker wait for reinforcements as Jones trying to get the table set here for the sun need a bucket here Tyus hes up the corner three won't get the roll J Jackson with them long arms right over the top of josh okogie Pippeng to Wells catch it shoot three no Plumlee's got the rebound Kevin Durant making his way back to the scores table Morris on the drive with a runner too strong body for the offensive rebound and gets it Monte inside and he'll draw the reaching foul a couple of baskets Jones waits for the Plumlee screen now moves away from it on the dribble Drive tied up on his way to the basket knocked out of running Durant off screens raising up with the three they're going to call a foul on Konchar K credit undiz as he is he plays big he's played big tonight averages three rebounds now Mark Davis the crew chief shot clock yeah but you know what you'll get your calls later Durant missing the first from the line tonight Kevin Durant splits the pair now how long Devin will sit over there obviously again being strategic with his minutes 27 minutes so far tonight for Booker ban on the drive gets a shot up a wild one missed Durant with a rebound Suns on the push Jones a run to the rim but Konchar there to get the block but they'll get the goal CH playing a pivotal role in this one tonight Jackson Jr bed up by Oso and Jaren Jackson Jr once again at the line looking to keep that gap between the Grizzlies lead and Phoenix who've never LED in this one as we mention the gri have not lost back toback game since mid November Jackson missing the fear too they've had their guys in and out of the lineup so they haven't been super healthy themselves and so this is a very good basketball team well they are think about this they are one of three 20 plus win teams in the Southwest Division yeah currently second in the west back to a cut Durant inside BR the bom this is when Jackson B a going to be aggressive now step back three from Bane I just think josh Okogie not not to say he can't get the ball again but make him use a v-cut up and out make him have to work to get open to receive the ball again six more made three Jones too strong with that one and then a have to do that against them as well now call a shooting foul John Konchar picking up the foul as Tyus at the free throw line to do with Memphis nine offensive rebounds in this second half yeah he's done the dirty work for him Jones allow him to get free touches Jackson Jr step back three yeah they've done it this second half with their three-point shooting KD's got it gets a step on Wells hangs in the air finds  Okogie six of the shot clock Kevin Durant fires a triple won't get it Kennard tracking down the loose ball rebound Bane head down barrels to the basket won't get it Kennard there for the offensive rebound out to Wells the three no Jackson as Phoenix has called a timeout to initiate the coach's Challenge on the loose ball foul well they took a look at that we game for the Suns to pull this out it's just based on what we've seen from this Grizzlies team ball of course you're going to have contact that's that's next to kind of rebound you like on the free throw line you go up there definitively like Ryan Dunn did un able to snatch it away but again a six-point deficit for the Suns to try to carve into Bane thank you and that two points from your point guard Josh Okogie making his way back to the scores table for defensive purposes obviously 21 for Tyus just under five to go four-point game Jackson Jr on the drive left hand floater off the glass he leaned and so Ryan Dunn did a heck of a job on him in the minutes that Ryan Dunn guarded him he was not able to do what he just did he was not confident with that first dribble you're absolutely right Kevin Durant working on the rookie Wells to the turnaround Bane wanted that catch and shoot three but Jones cut him off tries to go floater Baseline no loose ball rebound Tyus has got it kicks it across the floor to Durant they have really sat on that three-point line this is one of the better three-point shooting defensive teams in the league got to get it back but tius has got to do something here now deep three Bane with the block Dunn snatches it out of the air and at least got it on the iron and that that's that's all you need that was his job responsibility J had the corner look can't connect loose ball scooped up by Kennard Bane wanted another three he guns a pass into the corner Wells with it no Plumlee fighting her loose ball Jackson Jr hits the deck Plumlee stretching out he's got it and get the timeout it's pocket pass to the roll Plumlee brings the boom you can make him pay a price when he does as son clearly making that adjustment at halftime Jackson Jr off the screen with a leaner no long re out Jones has got it tius on the push finds Booker snatched away by Kennard 16 Phoenix turnover and a costly one at that oh man especially when you on a break offensive foul Jackson Jr Booker on the drive Left Hand high up the window here's Bane on the drive and kick well sets gets to look no K there for another offensive rebound that's all he's out there to do Kennard loads up for three out there 15 for Kennard Kevin Durant will get his chance at three no long rebound done Bo tius had it sets it to Booker got Kevin Durant has got to make sure gun step back look no loose ball rebound Baines got it inside left hand finish the loose ball offensive rebounds have just killed Phoenix this half Booker on the Baseline reverse won't get it Memphis has it four-point lead Konchar sneaking inside will get an Suns need to work quickly now down by seven Durant inside knocked Away Memphis recovers Memphis pretty much playing keep away right now Sun's in the penalty grizzli know it Jackson Jr has it blocked away tries to nearly did but into the hands of Wells and then Wells is foul K I mean you'd like them to start the game like that right you know because that's the difference in the ball game like the Gridley is going to win this game because of those hustle plays that they made well it's the hustle plays his Booker gets a clean look at the three won't get it follows his shot out to Durant reloads battles it inad they built early and they had the Suns in Chase two guys were really rocking and rolling uh for them 68 yeah and and so that's that's the difference and we Jaren Jackson I don't know if he score uh so if it's that you know you want to really put that in your note each individual player on this team and and ask themselves a question are they doing enough and I think that look in the mirror itself and like what can I do and then whenever one does that then you have that connectivity that can help your team but 17 turnovers as Kevin Durant at the free throw line 29 and 10 for dures or another yeah it is H able to win the tick Durant over to Dunn fires the three won't get it Jackson Jr with a rebound and Jackson Jr most players don't want to do that's the difference yeah and as I said the only team in the league ranks in the top five of both offensive and defensive rating this is the status of Bradley beel who only played 12 minutes tonight before he went referred to as a blue guy but when you look at Voice's contributions this year it's been way more than just zero you got a chance to to fight back especially Monte played the way Ryan played yeah and and obviously Grayson Allen as well so this team has to get healthy but guess what
