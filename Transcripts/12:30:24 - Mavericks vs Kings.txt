 this Crow are yes and and when you really look at kind of the struggles that the Kings have had six game losing streak they lost five in a row here on that last home stand the fans in this building are ready for some excitement they're ready to see harded by Fox shot clock at five Dinwiddie he tough ballway no battle for the rebound Keegan Murray rips it down and duck Christie has talked about trying to simplify things on the offensive end the primary thing is to get something into transition and then into flow offense as you see there you know being aggressive though I like it he feels like he has an advantage down there all other four guys lifted out on the perimeter you got space that foul was on Dinwiddie here's DeRozan over thrives tough follow away no it's a nice look though I like how they set the diagonal cross screen to bring him down to that low block on the left where he loves to operate Gafford strong to the hole Daniel Gafford year man out of Arkansas coming off a 15 and N game against Portland the other night Malik on the penetration to DeRozan Falling firing soring Hardy had Malik Monk by his waistband as he went by so Kings come out with a bucket on that one but they're going to have some physical defense tonight against this Mass team rymes the former New York Nick finds Dinwiddie in the corner guarded by Malik Dinwiddie unable to cash in here come the Kings all kned up at two De'Aaron Fox Big Boy Hardy Hardy coming back in the starting lineup tonight his third game back and I like that De'Aaron is being aggressive with him on the offensive end really pushing him making him have to defend here's Domantas controlling traffic out here looking for the two-man game sabonis thought about it oh he got pass get oh he went for it but Gafford was there for the rejection Mavs in transition and they nearly turn it away Grimes went with the jumper fourthe man out of Houston 42% three-point shooter yeah obviously he was in New York didn't didn't have the type of experience there the playing time he hoped for but he has a big role on this team gas decides to kick it out gets it back relocates to the three ball line really nice nice looking shot really nice looking shot by Domantas and he is shooting over 40% this season as well takes a couple of them a game goas close to 43% from three ball range here he is setting that screen for Malik monk with a nice bounce pass extra pass Fox gets hit foul on PJ Washington Jr De'Aaron will shoot free throws a little under the weather out here tonight well and and that didn't include Naji Marshall who is serving the the second to this Mavericks team success they'll be without him for two more after this yeah PJ Washington Jr just coming back from serving a suspension yeah that all happened two games ago against the Suns n and them got into it as you see Dinwiddie he scoring at The Rim there and the Kings pushing in transition Sacramento turns the ball over there first of the game here comes Dinwiddie former Brooklyn Net and it's bowed on the three ball attempt official James Williams says Malik monk got him on the arm so it'll be just getting an explanation there exactly what happened on that foul call hey Kings fans Toyota to scan the QR code now to start streaming historically they don't do well without Luka but this season so far s and three without LCA D yeah Luka has missed time for various reasons and they're going to have to evaluate it with that c strain but when you have Kyrie Irving that obviously changes things a little bit as De'Aaron Fox knocking down the triple he struggled truly struggled from Beyond The Arc in La just one of nine from Beyond the three-point strike yeah missed his first eight the other night as PJ looks to answer he does and he's another shooter for this MAV team they have a lot of great Shooters and and they have there's something in common between Sacramento and Dallas when it comes to the three-point shooting this year both of them in the top three a year year ago in attempts both of them in like the bottom five bottom six this year in attempts yeah it is changed for both squads why do you think that is with Dallas I mean they add a guy like Klay Thompson you would think they'd lean into it a little bit more you have Kay you have PJ wat Luka you have Kyrie I truly don't know kind of why that number has dropped so significant I think uh for them so the league as a hole are going up and if you stay around the same your numers going to keep dropping I think that is kind of a little what's going on oh Domantas with the nice reverse Kings back to within two sabonis 15 franchise going back to 2019 as Grimes puts it on the deck bottled up Dinwiddie he de three oh man he touched the sky with that one one thing when you play a team that is playing without their primary stars is the guys that are getting a bulk of the minutes it is an opportunity they don't see often so they are going to try and ball out goas hit the working overtime as sabonis see the shooting numbers both teams had a nice clip here early on as De'Aaron fox trying to check Dinwiddie he Fox multiple contest doesn't matter Dinwiddie multiple efforts I love the defensive tenacity on that play that was a great shot by Spencer Dinwiddie and that is something that he does incredibly well Spencer Dinwiddie coming off 17 the other night as DeRozan answers back with a two ball back to a four-point game 1915 see who they call that one on yeah they're going to get Kean Murray this is his first three of the night he started out hot two of two yeah a little miscommunication there ke Murray now puts it on the deck Maxi Kleber in there and pal also Out Sacramento can you know imagine this was uh a powerful moment for him tonight before this game started because since we've known Doug I mean prior to him even joining you know us Doug talking to the scorer's table and James Williams the official making some jokes you know it's interesting Doug you know had a great job here on the broadcast team oh yeah the crowd is getting on it turn the ball over over there a tough tough uh but I was mentioning you know he had the nice job as a broadcaster he said he had some un unfinished business he wanted to take care of why he decided to uh join the coaching staff want to help bring a championship to and learn from he talks about learning from Mike Brown obviously but you know he was on Alvin Gentry's staff as well who is one of the greats in this business and now kind of in the front office here in Sacramento he's had some some great mentors above him but there's nothing like when you step in it and it is now solely your responsibility that's the fourth turn over there by Sacramento Five Points off of them so far for the match and that was something they actually did great in La they did not turn the ball over a lot man PJ Washington I mean was there on the both both Dy and PJ Washington I have been defended very well tonight just suit in a three statistically those Corner threes are the the easiest to shoot try to take those away PJ looking for backto back Jacks and that's right Doug Christie will take the time out how about Doug and his family calling Sacramento home here yeah he's got a little bit of an uphill battle the Kings you know Losers of six straight and in a western conference this season Murray mid count muched but here's Jay and Gordman rookie out of overtime Elite picks up his dble goes off the glass too strong Here Comes Kevin hurder lar DeRozan and dearon fox set to check in next whistle hder meanwhile looking to lace one Kings has a team meanwhile PJ Washington we've seen him have big games in this building before with Charlotte without a doubt I mean and he is a true three-point shooter the scorers mentality and you know he's going to come out gunning four of four so far in this one now you have to you have to make an adjustment in terms of three-point shot to see if De'Aaron can put some pressure on gortman rookie 21 years of age here's PJ now to the basketball B up let's see what they call they're going to call a foul on Sacramento as to bonus that is going to be on tomorrow see you see in this SMUD clean power cam how onto rzan instead DJ averaging 12.2 already with 15 here in the first quarter DeRozan nice little find on the inside oh Domantas with the by Domantas is taking out some frustrations see him filling the stash sheet 65 and three so far Washington de two D he's just feeling it right now he is on the arc but he's six of eight from the field Huerter three ball unable to cash in white tow pulled down the rebound here's Gorton oh yeah whistle yeah all kinds of stuff for him and one of the things that we are seeing different uh with Doug Christie is that Alex Len is a part of the regular rotation um to shoot around in La he told everyone exactly what their role was what part of the rotation they were in and he is part of that fourman rotation coming off the bench yeah nine deep so far in this first quarter Trey Lyles goes behind the back Alex Len too strong here's gtman JayZ and gortman full of energy here 21y old guarded by Keon Ellis and I was looking up some numbers today and Keon Ellis has the best defensive rating on this Kings team uh second is Keegan third is domos actually but you know you want Keegan out there pressuring those guards and he takes it personally to roosen tough fou line jumper Alex L great job keeping it alive and and De'Aaron they didn't bite on the pump fake but he got a good solid look Kings come up with the offensive board Trey little right on that triple Kings now one of six from three-point range this guy meanwhile and that's for him but he's always been a great shooter I really think it's just about fit and comfortability obviously traded last year and and I think he just fits very nicely into Jason offensive sche Justin Timberlake is bringing his forget tomorrow world tour at a golden one Center on January 15th make sure to catch JT as he performs his Timeless hit to new favorites from his new album everything I thought it was tickets on sale at Golden One center.com at the trade deadline they were a solid team before then but getting PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford at the trade deadline help propel them to the NBA finals yeah it really did and and obviously the more time that luuka and Kyrie have had to play together and gel and create that chemistry uh I think is also a lot of the reason you know why we saw the success they had last season Fox on the dribble snaking his way Keon shot clock at six in traffic tough no Alex ly rejected by PJ Here Comes Hardy that was great defense by the m i mean they they covered everything they hustled out they hard close outs inside another bucket it's an 18-point lead 37 points allowed by Sacramento here in the first quarter something they've struggled with for a few straight games is dearon Fox gets fou is given up you know 40 Point quarters right Fox second in the association in total points off drives behind Shay Gil just Alexander as Fox will have another really the key to kind of slowing down this clamps on PJ Washington I mean he's on Pace right now to score nearly 60 in this game 19 points here in the first and that is where the adjustment needs to be made at this quarter break Mavs have seven threes four of them by PJ gortman oh they're going to wave it off offensive foul illegal screen Daniel Gafford quite obvious nice call by the officials absolutely definition of a moving screen so Gafford picks up his first he got about a 10-second differential between the clocks here box to the pain Gafford meets him at the top with the rejection this is a guy that had five blocks the other night against Portland second one here's gortman now let's do it yourself kid knocked out of bounds they're going to say Sacramento basketball 3.5 on the clock Gorton the rookie it's kind of a rookie error right there Doug subing in Keegan Murray Alex Len to the bench let's see what the Kings execute here Keon Ellis clock at two got to get it up Keon from the corner counted Splash from Keon as Sacramento hits their second trible Keon Ellis step back count it we got the second quarter coming FL too he's slow to get up Kings playing four on five Fox with the rebound but De'Aaron just now looks like he took a shot to the face especially the way he's trying to to clear the eyeball there nice offensive rebound Second Chance opportunity dearen back rims one Quentin Grimes in transition going right at Trey Lyles l got a piece of it and look at them push the ball right there gaining an advantage really making this defense struggle to get back and but they're scrambling well you got to get them credit five turnovers now Hardy misses the triple just the second Miss from T tonight for this Dallas Squad Mavs team have been on fire from three as De'Aaron takes the BP oh man that's a skill ladies and gentlemen to go over the big man yeah nice little soft touch on that shot takes the bump hang time in the air here first king split Dinwiddie all right Mavs have missed their last few threes Kings making a run here box on the stop pop High arker no back Tap Out Prosper just kicked in on the scoop they're going to give him the bucket and foul that's J unable to complete the three-point play so it's still a 12-point game Kevin Huerter back on the floor BS looking to turn the corner sprays it out L Alex Len doing some good work on the boards there nice job DeRozan back out the SPX Trey Lyles thought about it this time goes right to the C counted and what for and Kyle you asked me earlier what pace in the half court looks like that is exactly Hardy his second Kings Trail by 18 at one point in that first on that possession made an immediate decision no hesitation Hardy catches shoot Corner three and that's tough for Kevin he was defending there had outside under the rim nice skip pass for Dallas they got another triple dallas8 of 12 from behind the arc Derozan looking to answer oh splash throws him with seven now's got to get some stops Grimes side step three ball missed everything WOW Air M that one it'll be Sacramento basketball maintain an 87 12% three-point shooting throughout the course of this game they've missed some Kings have up the tempo in the half court as well Scramble for the ball try to get a little Advantage there Hardy was inside the circle back Tap Out Here Comes Keegan five on the clock King's got to get busy right here got to get it up Keegan oh block 24 second B Hill to the rim just couldn't get it off in time hean guarding Spencer Dinwiddie shot clock now at 8 hean on an island here one onone ball Dinwiddie he high off the glass and we got a foul Spencer Dinwiddie will shoot free throws going call this foul on Keegan Murray that'll be his second Keegan's reaction is probably the most frustration you'll ever see him show I think he feels like I think he feels like he got cheated a little a little bit on that one not a lot of contact and frustration I think a little bit in himself as well for allowing the drive points here in the first half including a perfect five for five from the free throw line King down by 11 under eight to play here in the second quarter Murray catching shoot and grind with his third rebound tonight Hardy trying to go oneon-one against Huerter Hardy perky jerky with it red belet stay right in his Hip Pocket going to have to pump that ball up a little bit at the timeout nice back door oh but they continue to move the ball both full court and in the half court getting high quality shots average just seven points here in this second quarter Maxi Kleber makes the extra pass nice close out by LS there that was that high five contest we saw from Trey Mavericks get the second chance opportunity Malik with a good challenge there really nice job especially forcing him into that step back along the Baseline hanging and we got a foul here onto Mavericks as tonight 19 points four of five from deep and scored Malik makes two of two dearon Fox set the check in heads to the scor table got a seven-point ball game gortman now thought about a three instead Grimes oh we got a wedgie here as Domantas and the Kings win the T stay ohar that's a push in the waist right there De'Aaron D Roan what a nice it was that left hand pushing De'Aaron in the stomach that's an immediate whistle for an official bman picking up his second personal Kings back to within four a 70 run as De'Aaron now in double figures with 10 look at De'Aaron look at this ball pressure at midc court cor just pass midcourt line 100% AB shooting 45% from the field after a blistering start in the First Kings with the turnover got numbers here Keegan Murray with the save DeRozan dribble Drive finding Domantas on the inside extra pass Kings with some full coure pressure speeding up the Mavs here PJ Washington looking to answer with a three PJ finally has cooled off now four six after making his first four threes as Malik finds doas on the inside and the Kings back on spot defensively for the Kings they've done a tremendous job defending the perimeter in the second quarter that MTH Squad was seven of eight from downtown in the oh nice little scoop counted nice finish there tough basket that's Brandon Williams third year man out of Arizona leik monk sets his feet as Grimes is bottled up Williams now PJ Washington 19 in that first quarter looking for more right here way off that's great defense by sabonis Kings on to push here De'Aaron Fox rims out a triple man that thing was halfway down May a lap and then came back out King's three-point shooting struggles continue here but they're scoring in a lot of different ways now Gafford misses the bunny on the inside and the most important thing they getting stops yeah they've really picked up the pressure defensively and that's going to be a foul on Gafford oh they call that Quentin Grimes  oh tripping yeah got the at the top there it's going to be right here that's a tough call that's a tough call hey we we'll take some of those every now and then right having a call go your way oh man that's a that's a tough pass to catchar well and he was trying to go to the paint and the ball was leading him to the Baseline there King now with seven turnovers to the mass spot Here Comes Gafford to set that screen Domantas on the switch on Dinwiddie Gafford getting way deep got the size Advantage can shoot right over Dinwiddie as Gafford pulls down another rebound Mavericks up by three Dinwiddie high off the glass and Coach chrisy will take the time out um Doug obviously known for his defense and that was kind of his superpowers De'Aaron not able to connect there but Queens come up with the with the board Doug did it in what five four or five seasons yeah yeah five four and change four and change so that just kind of shines a light on on defensively how special Doug chrisy was oh man Kleber wow snuck up on said I'm all good with being friends I know a lot of these guys are your friends he's like but you guys guys can go out and see each other after the game we don't need any of that stuff prior and at The Rim by Dallas WEA had a couple of blocks the other night against Portland as Malik shot clock was winding down misses a three five-point ball game 235 to go here in the second Dinwiddie going right at De'Aaron and De'Aaron picks up his third De'Aaron gave him a pat on the back play on seven-point ball game oh Gafford with the block but Malik stays with it Gafford already with three blocks nine for the Mavs as a team box with the tip oh man going to say see exactly what happened gaer to 67.7% free throw shooter knocks down to first let's get a quick word from Jack in thex the best rated Burger in fast food with more beef than a big ma keep up Ronald welcome to jock in the Box M long in the front court with Jaffer at 610 yeah even without yeah Livy who you know is just in his second season had a phenomenal rookie campaign really loved what he did started 42 games for them off the bench played 55 last year they've got some some good talent in that in that back court or that front Court doas doubled stay with it damont sabonis looking like Moses Malone getting his own rebound and push back Omas 10 points eight rebounds five assists Kleber thought about a three great ball movement here by the Mavs PJ Runner and they'll get to the line for two free throws and left wing yeah those two guys spent two years together in Charlotte Malik Mon and PJ Washington Jr we one ofs on that team PJ came into the lead was 20 make it 21 Kings trailing by seven 56 49 90 seconds to go here in the second quarter Fox getting to his spot foul line jumper life work nobody nobody even near him in that he had so much time it actually his his first step is so quick that when he gets to his spot it looks like he's in slow mo here's Brandon Williams looking for the inside is Gafford man Gafford does a great job using his body getting the bucket there Trey did everything he possibly could to try and stop that but he needs another six Ines Malik oh heau a body trying to challenge him Doug Christie has to be pleased with the effort and the competitiveness of this Kings team here especially in the second quarter Dinwiddie he know Domantas up to Fox Fox Big Boy sty Fox Force Five will have a three-point opportunity they have battled back as now PJ Washington has three personal fouls De'Aaron makes the three-point play he's got 15 important to say the difference in the second quarter is holding this Mass team to one of 10 from Beyond The Arc Williams little too easy get to the paint Brandon Williams gets hit on the line look they call deont sabonis right there on the elbow he's got picked up two quick ones Williams will have another remember this MAV severely short-handed yes no clay no Kyrie no Lively no Luka Nai Marshall serving as suspension Dante exam also out because of right wrist surgery so other guys getting an opportunity one of those I feel like every team that we face this season has had legitimate injury issues around the Le here early and it's it's it's puzzling about a 4 second 5sec differential between the clock Fox raises up too strong M's got some time here up by four here's Dinwiddie CLE at the buzzer it comes up just a little strong and at the end of the first half your kings Trail to the mass and their blocks is carrying hise right nowe right got it back on play on I don't know how it happens it happens so much see we see it all the time I mean I had to practically cut mine off with the tape scissors after games those suckers were tied so tight Washington no gapper battling keeps it alive Domantas first one to the floor and all that is because De'Aaron Fox came down to help Domantas on the board Murray left wide open still unable to find the mark from distance didn't he I think he was expecting a foul there instead the king's challenging at The Rim is Domantas fox get to a strong hand yeah take a look at De Fox not only his speed but his handles and being able to get to the spots that he wants finishing contact all right he needs some help right here yeah nice grab nice grab not going to take any chances at all to get up in his shooting motion so they call it on the floor to DeRozan now guarding Gafford PJ puts it up since starting four for four from behind the ark PJ has missed his last for yeah bonus nice little jump hook we're all noted up at 60 and that's an area where the Kings have done an excellent job as outscoring this Mavericks team in the paint now 36 to 18 Advantage for Sacramento P witty oh man he hit the reverse shifted the lever down and went the other way Dinwiddie now with 19 oh nice jab step by Malik looking for the wraparound pass Domantas to the ground again shot clock at six De'Aaron extra pass Keegan on the dribble Drive got to get it up Malik and another block shot here for Dallas that's a block though I got to see that again look like he got absolutely CL Robert oh Keegan took one to the chest you better call that no they call it a blocking foul Two Shots coming for PJ Washington okay I both things happen where you there not take credit to the officials because we're watching it live it's happening so fast and there's three of them on the floor for a reason because angles can be so deceptive for what you see so they're they're catching all of this in live and need this to say got look through Doug Christie or Jason kid too yes all right PJ Washington now with 23 back to a four-point lead oh they run a double at to DeRozan as he gets hit to challenge this foul call we got a green light special here personal fou is his fourth personal and and he's been so good just aggressive in the first half getting to his spots he's got 10 points obviously going to need him in this second half so he's got to be careful only the six turn over of the game for the Mavericks they're one of the better teams at taking care of the ball 11th in the league in turnovers and I want to see the Kings get back to the PACE that they were playing with in the first half they're slowing it down here as Don sabonis not able to get that layup to go but that defense didn't have to move at all on that possession yeah you're right about that and then Hardy miss a shot on one end give up a three on the other back to a seven-point lead and that's just the second triple for this Mass team since they went seven of eight in the first quarter he got hit and Hardy will pick up the foul that'll be his third checks in checks in for De'Aaron who had to leave with four personal monk makes a pair back to a five-point game to DeMar DeRozan 10 points three rebounds two assist Grimes look at Baseline PJ shot clock now at six Dinwiddie checked by Keegan Dinwiddie with the push off we play on nice defense there by Young Keegan Mur in transition keonis oh he got clber oh my go so much contact Downs in the first half for the Mavericks just nine for the Kings the only downside of that of course is that it slows the game really was how the Kings got back into it in the second Hardy has to check out with four personals Maxi Kleber back on the floor at 610 Hardy just 6'4 so you got 6 610 Kleber out there 610 Daniel Gafford Keon makes a couple 6764 ni yeah you see that Ellis caning De'Aaron Fox felt like that was a flop from PJ Wasington but I feel like Now's the Time to settle in calm down and we've made made our Point yeah keep an eye on these two right here PJ guarded by Fox here shot 10 and they're going to get him for another foul De'Aaron Fox just laughing here at the call by CJ Washington tost him up yeah going to it yeah going to it again De'Aaron with the Gamble Washington no Gafford tip rebound snatch oh Malik Mo goes down hard Fox clearly angry gets fou by G De'Aaron an ovation here so it's Kevin Huerter Keon Ellis sabonis Murray and Malik monk to five on the floor mon working on D pal doas with the push that's a foul too he got pushed in the waist but this has been a physical game and you got to you cannot play The Whistle you got to play through it PJ Washington trying to get into his bag on the dribble Drive they're going to count it and the things walk to them and then it's about a lot of shots Malik in transition got hit Malik coming alive here in the third turnover that we've seen here over the last you know few minutes it didn't feel like they were focusing on it enough this season I think the addition of Demar DeRozan kind of made them the league and turnovers at just above 13 a game they've been one of the better team they really have except there's been times and especially during the 16 losing streak where those turnovers had led to way many points off because they've been unforced untimely Corner three is no good rmes missed that one here comes Malik monk monk sitting on 12 here looking for more as he penetrates nice kick outes Corner three spash with been back now for a few games his first game back he was Unstoppable from Beyond the AR Keon foul by Williams after the steal the night but Keon's defense getting into that passing Lane jumping up stealing the ball taking the contact chrisy luks FOX huddled up over here right in front of us here as Keon has two free throws T set to check back in and playing incredibly hard love his drive and the pace which he is playing with and leading this team all right it's a three-point ball game here 350 to go in the third Bo guarding Willam Huerter pressuring Hardy all the way the look at that yeah nice help King for this the turnover Ellis on the kick out extra pass Pi Corner three Domantas leads to a Huerter triple one got to go down ktie one of these for possession SC for Sacramento this whole game but specifically this possession oh he took the hit but Domantas five offensive rebounds for the Sacramento Kings offensive rebounds at that last time out that possession alone just catapulted in the rebound category 80 Sacramento run as TR offensive foul going the other way try eight sacrificing his body truly with four for Dallas Fox looking for the lead yes sir put him on your back number five did wow that is a tough tough shot right there but now you've got a little bit of numbers you can take advantage popped up and was back down quick out of bounds we're going to stay on this end as well here comes Fox Kings down by one 18-footer C he dug chrisy to coach with a fist pump as Sacramento Back on Top by one kwity now with six trying to muscle his way that's great defense by red velvet here come to Kings up by one jar Huerter looking to bring the house down got it and I think it's safe to say that the fans that have come out tonight to watch the Kings at Golden One their toughest stretch of the season they are appreciating the effort the energy and the level of compete tonight there it is 15-2 Sacramento run six on the clock Hardy misses the layup King's got numbers here Ellis on the dribble drive and we got kick ball and Malik M back on the floor give him a lot of credit here in this third playing with that Spirit to start this third quarter and Keon Ellis too great minutes here in the third from Keon you look at yeah over back that is a tough one if you're chasing kid because to put an end to it that is a careless turnover yeah 11 turnovers now for Dallas make it 12 actually as Tre oh man PJ talking that trash too 12 blocks in this one for Dallas you got to give them credit they've been great at The Rim oh look at Keegan Murray pal had inside position meanwhile the Kings nearly had a break here man it is a Breakneck Pace here this is what I was talking about though with the level of compete Doug Christie said I'm going to make sure that no one outworks this team that is who I was and that is who they need to be PJ three ball no battle for the rebound keeg get Murray his fourth shot clock is off doing a great job on the boards with Domantas on the sideline right now here comes BX against croser I don't know how many trips around the rim that one took but it took its sweet time Kings pressuring here with. n a six-point game and the Mavericks they run and complaining to the Keegan muray get to his T tough shot tough shot right there nice job by Keegan he can get in the paint he can get to those shots oh Malik whistle for the foul that'll be Malik's third made it difficult but one of the hardest things as a player when you're playing an environment like the kings are tonight this this Arena has been fantastic that third quarter was phenomenal the energy provided is to not let it get you so amped up that you just become a hack oh look at Trey Lyles he's barking out there yeah Trey whistle for a technical here as pwit he makes that gotten the tech they're just being good citizens and raising money for NBA Charities Trey playing to five here with doas on the bench yeah drives too many steps and that is the pressure that Malik monk is applying on the minutes here tonight spending a lot of energy but guess what you got 11 more minutes you got to keep it up oh Trey Lyles left open Splash two late third quarter that helped shift the entire game yeah I agree du and when you look at that first quarter and how this Mavericks team played offensively 60% from the field seven of eight from Beyond The Arc third quarter they had just six made field goals and turned the ball over seven times to me it was about the level of compete yeah the competing physicality I thought was outstanding and I hope they could build off that that's what they're going to have to do especially when the offense isn't clicking all the time all right de appreciate you man we'll see you on the postgame show as soon as this one is done as the Kings turn it over to 12 Sacramento's largest lead in the game yeah look at that kind of pulled the chair out from under him a little bit it's going to be the king's ball and this is where you've got Domantas on the sideline he's got a little bit of foul trouble he picked up his skin a little rest here and Keegan playing in that Center position just battling down low hasn't been a bigger CH leer over there Kevin Huerter off the hand off turns the corner oh he oh he put the brakes on that man that was a $10 move but the shot couldn't fall I don't think he expect it to be so open yeah look at Keegan Murray man doing all the little things out here is Keegan Murray tonight Malik oh man he looked like Earl Campbell going to the basket there another fullback another offensive rebound by the Kings they have been just outstanding in that category here in this game 15 offensive rebounds for Sacramento De'Aaron Fox you got to get it up Trey at the buzzer got it Yi and the Kings turning things are here in the later second half man this match team shook right now yeah he's done that a few times ain't nothing ain't nothing for him right Trey Here Comes Malik now 10 on the shot CL back out to ke Murray had a great look at it couldn't cash in Kings on a 25-3 run here up by 13 Dinwiddie looking to stop that run oh man Big Time shot yeah he's got 26 now couple steps behind they haven't gotten anything going into the pain I think he felt it was better to P out and then De'Aaron fox answers back the Kings have knocked down consecutive triples box with 26 Dinwiddie looking for back to back oh man Kevin Huerter can't believe it he said we got a challenge and and he turns around and starts walking towards the officials and Doug immediately says to him no waiting for his coaching staff to to look at the replay and say if they're going to and that's where the Kings really changed things here in this game you're right about that five turnovers for the Mavs in that first half that has allowed Sacramento to get back in the game this second half as Dinwiddie misses the second all right so Doug challenged this foul call after review they say Kevin Huerter did not allow Dinwiddie to land so an unsuccess give him a little bit more space he was very upset about it but hey I'm cool with that because this every Kings player that has stepped on the floor particularly in this second half are giving an allout effort on the defensive end and they're playing with passion Trey Lyles no Malik with the tick Kings up by 11 Spencer Dinwiddie he has a season High 28 points and PJ Washington misses the jump hook DJ Washington had 19 points in that first quarter he a perfect four four from downtown he's got 28 in this game right now wow De'Aaron Fox he's cooking call him Chef Fox foxy up to 29 three triples in this game and listen he's only got four points thr oh nice move by Dinwiddie there he's got 30 now lost a little defensively on that possession don't get comfortable with this lead the Kings went from trailing by 18 in that first half had what a 13-point lead yeah if look at the a fox man and he draws the foul here that'll be his fifth throws it back on the floor Keon Ellis out there also Domantas on the floor as well he's got three personal fouls shot clock at four extra pass Grimes the coaching staff wanted to travel Luke L is right there pleading his case to CJ Washington I'd have to see it again we can't see the sideline from our angle but Luke was very adamant about that one monk foul line jump good money 14 now M makes it look easy you do all the work and you use your scen well you quick dribble you're going to get those open looks that just look so simple King's in rotation here nice close out by Keon Ellis Ellis working on Grimes Grimes trying to create some space Kleber extra pass they swing it around corner three ball no good rebound Keon Ellis can I just point something out and and our viewers at home can watch just watch Keon Ellis on a defensive possession just watched him and you'll see what we're talking about he's a tremendous Defender such a great team Defender and he's going to give you everything he's got Malik with the high hands Kleber three ball no man you mention it they started out redot seven of eight since then four of 21 here's DeRozan looking to close him out to DeRozan got it how about that little since then 28 yeah multiple efforts look at Domantas right there casing point I mean we got five minutes left in this and 28 points looky he wanted a foul callon Ellis Stone Face with the defense Derozan deep two oh yeah they're going to get on to push off that'll be gaffer's Fon Ellis's defense is just it's his superpower and he talked about in college that he was a scorer and realized this you have to find something that is your Niche and he has committed himself to that end of the floor and really makes a huge difference I told you earlier that he's leading this team at 108.4 Keegan second at 110.5 and and that just shows you a lot about what his focus is and last fou he changed to PJ Wat noon CHS it downon Fox set the check back in and you gotten this lead by playing fast and playing with Pace but here's where you want to be a little bit more deliberate in the half cour of using up clock while you've got this lead oh man tough to be second call on opponent is right as he was clearing you hardly ever see that Williams here Williams oh man he took a couple of long strides there it's all the way long Strider 61 but plays like what 62 to say like like there's a zero missing there 11-point ball game Kings 3 minutes and 45 seconds away from snapping this streak extra pass Fox out to De'Aaron got to get it up to roseen three ribs out there's that man oh likely to go long on the other side so when you don't have that inside Advantage what you want to try and do is push that rebounder that defensive rebounder under the basket Domantas just knows no they really made him work he's done a great job in terms of protecting the rim I mean as a team the the maps have all been phenomenal now Domantas was 17 points to go with his 16 boards and seven assists tonight he's filling that stat shees heavily contested shot right there that is not someone that you would necessarily call a hot player I mean he's shooting a good clip but not a super volume shooter but tonight with a lot of key guys out guys are looking for calling their own number nine-point gain to DeRozan K gets a piece of that another block shot that's 13 blocks now for the maver they they have tremendous in that area tonight 13 blocks five of them by Gafford that was a good pick up for them that really made them better DeRozan with five on the clock Bullseye mid-range assassin Demar DeRozan now with 14 leak sky for the rebound he's got seven boards to go along with the 14 points and five assists HK extra pass Fox step back got to stop here you want to see if you can't get this to 15 give yourself a little bit more cushion Grimes hanging Scramble for the ball Keegan comes up with it Malik in transition going up H oh Kentucky to Kentucky connection please large segments of time right you talk about playing 48 minutes right um to play at that level from a compete standpoint the amount of mental and physical exhaustion that that can take you have to really Prime yourself to play that way and it's been phenomenal tonight Kings turn it over here 11-point ball game De'Aaron Fox off he took his lunch money De'Aaron Fox easy money for De'Aaron Fox and that is why he's now second in King's franchise history on that steals list coach Christie with 124 left to go and a 13-point lead move right there pushes it out in front that's an easy bucket for De'Aaron I can't tell you how badly this squad needs this from a mental standpoint and an emotional standpoint a six game losing streak y five of those coming on their home floor and and Malik monk in his statement uh after the last home loss was it was an apology to the fans because this this team Kyle understands how special it is to play in this building how special the fans that show up and cheer them and I'm I'm proud of this team for what they've done tonight and proud for the fans that they've got to experience this type of in as well yeah exactly and and the fans gave the love back I mean this crowd just tremendous tonight yeah they have been on their feet loud enthusiastic gortman with the steel on mlin it makes the bucket 10-point game now you got to finish out strong here yeah yeah it's it's nerve-wracking but it's tough coming in having set for the first 47 minutes right 6 seconds left Isaiah Crawford nice little F aen missed the dunk but got it back here come to Ms down by 10 under 50 to play Williams elbow jumper makes it an eight-point game Jason kid calling for the Trap here Kobe Jones on the dribble drive Jordan McLaughlin nice little find on the inside Alex Len patience on that offensive possession they move the ball as much of the clock as they could got a really nice shot from Alex Len nice little scoop Len clears it shot up off in this king's crowd rising to it feet stand up Sacramento that's a final coach Doug Christie gets his first win as interim coach raing up Malik monk much love as the Kings Battle back from down
