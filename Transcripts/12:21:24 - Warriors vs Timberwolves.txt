able to get in the paint make the next pass Mike Conley Anthony Edwards Jaden McDaniels excellent Defender with Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert so we'll just pretend the game started at the previous half hour never happened McDaniels missing that three and Trayce with a rebound Shawn Ry and Shan Corbin Simone jelks blowing the whistles tonight slowmo fading and off back iron Randle pretty solid defense Julius Randle the big acquisition with Donte DiVincenzo for Karl Anthony-Towns Randle kicking it out Mike Conley good close out by Schroder shot clock at 10 Randle to that mid-range and off fire there Trayce inhaling rebounds OH Anderson didn't give up a Blow by at least make him pull up Steph Curry lot was made and did not have a field goal against Memphis in 24 minutes that hadn't happened in his career Wiggins the former Timber Wolf and Minnesota's an elite defensive team they made that very tough on Andrew there McDaniels is kind of limping back after that one that just ended up being ISO though after the switches got to be ready for a switching defense Anthony Edwards takes 10 threes a game missing there over 10 threes a game he's one of Five Guys in the league that takes over 10 not even Steph is over 10 threes a game he's like 9.9 and also Edwards 42% so well Schroder from the Baseline and Dennis Schroder he had a rough shooting night in his first Warrior debut only going two of 12 so it's good to see that go down well he hit his first mid-range this game just like he hit his first mid-range last game McDaniels again from Deep these are the rebounds that been eluding theall they know who you want to leave open Steph misses his first shot they switched out onto him pretty well there to get that contest t- wolves have open 0 for four here Edwards trying to end that Conley missing the three Mike Conley is really struggled shooting the ball last year was a career best Trayce Jackson-Davis made sure go couldn't get that rebound Schroder missing there but Conley he's been shooting 20% the last three games he was one for five against the Knicks had a wrist injury in the off season kind of playing through that go there first field goal of the game he took only one shot against New York in the entire game well that's how he's going to get his offense if his teammates make it easy on him that's a ball screen where Anthony award is able to get downhill and and draw gold Bear's defender in Kyle Anderson dropping in that three this is a better start offensively for the Warriors Wiggins has the tough defensive assignment because Edwards is going to get his Andrew stayed right with him couldn't even pull Randle missed it short Trayce Jackson-Davis you got to love how he's rebounding and again no blow by by Anderson has five rebounds already moving his feet Wiggins out of the corner missing that three you're going to have to deal with a good amount of iso with this Timber team because if their first action doesn't work they're just going to try to beat you off the dribble after you know a ball screen or whatever it is set a screen to get Edwards on to step but now McDaniels trying to create a little space shot clock at five rand's got nothing going has to make something out of nothing and Trayce Jackson-Davis met him up top Trayce with a block they're setting the tone defensively Schroder hustling it back dropping it back to Trayce the stifled Tower was there and he flipped it over him and the pump fake pump fakes work that's one thing that was kind of missing in that Memphis game where they were both beginning for TR Jackson-Davis Four Points six rebounds and Sher creating already finding some rapport with his big man getting all the way to the paint drawing the help in dishing it back Conley is fouled on the pass Conley the lob and go both of Minnesota's field goals put Trayce Jackson-Davis in a tough position there cleared out that whole side no help Al Anderson pretty physical Play Trayce Jackson-Davis called for the foul on that re so Steph sitting and buddy heeled in says they stay with that same substitution pattern for Steph Edwards missing and Kyle Anderson the rebound em motion to a running Trayce Jackson-Davis to hammer it down that's the Warriors best finisher coach said it four or five times when was young i' probably been 10 times at various stages of my basketball fandom they always get someone with the fake bucket of water y Edwards inside and Randle was denied Randle banging bumping pump faking and laying it in and drawing the foul and Julius Randle the three ball pretty well this month he's over 40% for this month but he's trying to get downhill and go at your head anytime he gets a chance also an elite free thrower for a big guy 82% yeah he had 24 against the Knicks his former team completing the three-point play so Gobert out and Warrior killer Naz Reid it says that on his driver's license by the way n Reid went 1 for seven against New York I've never I can't even imagine that as Randle fouls Trayce Jackson-Davis see Randle was trying to bring the ball pressure there they're not a a big fouling team they're only sixth when it comes to personal fouls but he was trying to bring the ball pressure and if you're Trayce Jackson-Davis he's up on you like that look to drive it like Trayce Jackson-Davis was starting to Kyle Anderson on his former teammate buddy heel didn't catch that cleanly former Warrior DiVincenzo and what a block by Trayce Jackson-Davis on Alexander-Walker already this is way different than last game against Memphis this the Jackson-Davis quarter sprinting back six points six rebounds Spike that one now that's an unfortunate offensive foul DiVincenzo when do we play Oklahoma City next driving and flipping it in Donte with a beautiful drive they're trying to get more of that in their game as a team that's trying to find themselves more offensively they've relied on the three ball so much more than they did last year last year they one of the best paint point teams in the League this year not as much obviously Cat last year helped that buddy heel missing the three and Anthony Edwards Rebound in motion Julius Randle setting up ANS and that mid-range off fire Dennis Schroder with a rebound so Schroder and Wiggins with Kyle Anderson Kevon Looney's first playing time and healed both teams Minnesota and the Warriors same record same offensive problems off the Looney's hands and the Warriors turn it over well they they haven't been really forced turnovers that one again they just weren't able to catch it right but Looney had the right idea of just sealing his man and warriors are trying to take advantage of some of the over playing but it's the same thing with that de chinela he's kind of over playing on the outside Andrew Wiggins could have spun back Baseline I think Kuminga first playing time you need some energy and some offense from Johnathan Kuminga Reid on that post up and it was shudder that denied him St DiVincenzo setting up Randle and he was denied there Warrior defense much better than it was against Memphis and Dallas and Looney running the floor and a really nice find from Kuminga there you go I don't think they had scored since that timeout but again getting out in transition see if they want to back that's randle's game that that is a Randle three-time Allstar two time all NBA he was most improved in the league in 2021 that's the thing with this team offensively they go so much ISO with him and Anthony Edwards everybody is trying to find a way to get in Rhythm dash pass by door Dash as your door to All Things basketball Mr Curry back in after that rest in between quarters Steph starts every quarter finishes every qu and gets his rest in between the timber are trying to kind of fighting frustration offensively too it Anthony Edward is actually like okay we don't have an identity offensively all we know is I'm going to shoot a lot of shots Julius Randle is going to shoot a lot of shots and that's about it dinga had that deflected and then Steph good hands as Alexander-Walker tried to throw it off of him and Buddy heel gets a three how about that from disaster to Delight right there he's got to be careful with the turnovers thrown into hands Randle traveled there well they'll turn it over some late we just had before the game a McDaniel is as good a job on Steph as anybody Steph off back iron there Gary Payton II kept it alive but DiVincenzo comes out of the pack St still hasn't scored yet DiVincenzo for three that's an air ball Donte had a career best in New York he was bombing threes from everywhere that has not been the case this year dominga mid-range you saw go change that shot low scoring two teams that are seventh in the league in defensive rating and Naz Reid he hits a three I said one of seven against the Knicks he sees the warrior logo and Naz Reid is he so well against everybody else and then everybody else kind of just struggled defensively and offensively against the Mavs Alexander-Walker tried to throw that back and they got a little complacent I felt like against the Mavs like they were just kind of happy to to be there go bear good Rotation by The Warriors shot clock at seven out of bounds and out of bounds and so that false step you had talked about like they were against the Memphis Grizzlies much better defensively this game McDaniels holding on to Steph and called for the foul but that's only the second team foul finding their identity also you don't normally see a team three times in 15 days true not in the NBA regular season Steph saved that over and back just barely dp2 to Buddy heel nice elbow jumper and Buddy remember he had 27 against Minnesota when the Warriors beat them on December 8th but did you see the way he reacted to that drive though with a Sprint got to that spot it a defense is focused on that drive they're going to turn their heads they're not going to be able to see you see man and ball take advantage it's a big cover for Kuminga because n's Reid feels like he can do whatever he wants against the Warriors knocked Away by pton Buddy healed quick as man of the ball running with curry staff to Gary Payton II and he had it blocked but it's a goalen once it hit the backboard you can't touch it Shay guildas Alexander's cousin the keil Alexander-Walker dropping that jumper in Steph Curry I knew that he would have a field goal tonight that's his first one and again involving Gobert Gobert is in drop coverage off that ball screen I really went out on a limb by the way as good as Steph is beautiful steel Kuminga feet set and rattles home the three that's nice you're getting a little separation now you've talked about running K and talked about pace and you can kind of feel it they're getting stops and then everybody is sprinting buddy Hield always leads the way on those Sprints now's Reid missing and Kinga could not secure that rebound well right now War's defense is helping their offense right the tone the force they're playing with they're playing with that sense of urgency you need hungry for a win Hungry Like The never mind wolves like the what Hungry Like The Wolves oh nice okay sure out of the corner the Miss three by Alexander-Walker about a 4 second game shot clock difference on now's Reid Steph ball screen coming Looney trying to wipe out Naz Reid kega to beat the shot clock did well just to hit iron and the Warriors played the clock appropriately from midcourt and that will do it not happy with you the lead singer of Durand Durant I got you I I'm sorry I apologize but even off his leg no clue Brandon Podziemski his first playing time no Draymond Green tonight no Moses Moody Steph Curry in open three buddy heel went in there and Trayce Jackson-Davis able to track that down they're crashing the offensive glass more ferociously and guys were getting back it was perfect no one stayed Steph getting all he can eat right now he had been one of five hitting that mid-range there there's a different energy to the Warriors game much better no one just standing around you're you're very Resolute with what you're doing out there is O it was just a step slow just it was close Reid went fast if he didn't go fast he might have got it so Gary Payton II dealing with Edwards face tck to Davis has go Podziemski and M Conley Conley a little leaner on fire and step The Rebound in motion Tred to go bumper car move but pinski didn't let him do it Go bear he knocked that away and the Warriors fortunate to have the ball Alexander-Walker is saying I didn't touch it but I don't know that he used to challenge in the second quarter in a play that doesn't evolve points the jamski was a bright spot in Memphis he played well Brandon played really well him and Andrew Wiggins go beautiful overplay and steel he was out of bounds on the sideline so the Warriors will still retain possession okay so there's the overplay so you can look for the cuts the cuts are there if if the pass initially is tough and they're trying to deny see if you can go back door like if they're going to give you some easier buckets or some Lanes to the basket go ahead and take it only five to shoot Steph with the three perfect so Curry's got eight the Warriors shooting 52% for a month they've been shooting 42% as a team he makes that look so easy that was sweet but his footwork is impeccable and it's not as easy as he makes it look o Reid had it knocked away but go scooped it up Alexander-Walker showing and go and you got a 3se second violation trying to figure out what to do Edwards is a superstar he's like let me call my own number that three halfway down out and Gary Payton II what a rebound so you can't say enough about how Trayce Jackson-Davis has played wipe out screen on Conley you it'll be going to the offensive glass you're okay with that those are errors of aggression Randle looked down at the line shot clock at seven and wasn't cleared for takeoff slowmo into the lane and lose that out of bounds I was expecting Kyle to hit that he hits that shot very often it just went he was just upset at The Rim Edwards does not have a field goal in the game and so that's not going to last for long tell you watch Randle go to work and Looney did everything and didn't foul him just bothered him on the shot they are struggling offensively the timber wolves are Gary Payton II Rhythm dribble shot it over everything Warriors fortunate that Minnesota touched it remember the Memphis game we said hey the Warriors are shooting 23% that's a Timberwolves Minnesota is shooting 20 Gary Payton II on the duck in to lay it up and in he was bobbling the ball that's why that wasn't a travel there two Defenders went with Steph Curry Under out of bounds that worked aen McDaniels one of my favorite Defenders to watch Conley that blocked the worst can play any better on the defensive side and they keep adding to this the Podziemski missing that three Looney another opportunity clock at seven Conley's a very good Defender chot clock at three Podziemski to the mid-range and you see Minnesota's defense very solid there Edwards He's missed a he's missed a layup I I can't believe it he's 0 for six Kuminga hitting a three out of the corner and that's just but yes the Warriors watching Memphis put in 27 made threes have ruin her item of the game Conley had that knocked away Wiggins right off the bench and contributing defensively right now the timber rules feel like they're six Warriors out there Warriors are everywhere how hot is Kuminga missed that three after making his first two and Looney will say he touched it last Warriors are for seven the Warriors getting stops getting out in transition they had numbers there that's the way to go cuz the Timberwolves are 24th in Pace they're not out in transition a ton so if you can get up and down you'll have a lot of success right now it's just keeping the Timberwolves at Bay they're going to go on a run at some point you would think yeah butan you have them scoreless for nearly half a quarter and getting every defensive rebound I love Jonathan coming back there maybe you keep them from going on a run if you keep playing this type of Defense Schroder trying to throw that lob Kinga just tapped it to Looney now Reid was ready for that lob play and Wiggins off iron the Warriors are cooling off themselves shooting but they are holding Minnesota to 20% but you're getting whatever you want offensively you're getting some great looks now's Reid having it knocked away every Drive is tough the help is ready the worriors have four blocks it's nice to see blocking other teams Warriors have getting blocked you know the Warriors get blocked the fifth most in the league step through McDaniels couldn't finish that but Naz Reid he lost the handle but he was fouled in the process principles and moving their feet because a lot of times the play breaks down they're just going ISO where is and moving their feet Anthony Edwards still struggling Warriors are quick to that 50/50 ball make sure they got that rebound 10 nothing this quarter for the Warriors and it and we have shoter being fouled by Conley that's my point though You' got them at zero keep going you know get it to 20 I mean really push this lead we're trying Wiggins Warriors not buying one right now Podziemski kept that alive nicely Schroder all right now the Warriors are getting way too three happy here they're only six of 20 on threes don't let Minnesota off the hook and Anthony Edwards still can't buy one I you need to be up 30 if the team can't score in an entire quarter T rules are great defensively Kuminga took it inside Looney couldn't tip it home we have a 10 nothing quarter we played half of it open three and McDaniels finally drops one home you can tell from his reaction he was exasperated after that one the crowd kind of gave him a a little cheer they had had a field goal since 115 left in the first yeah Schroder and see this has been the warrior offense they're down to 38% shooting we we've seen this movie unfortunately on repeat Edwards tried to lean in McDaniels missing that three Schroder in on Conley and he will get to the line yeah he he made sure he got the contact there he wasn't avoiding it we saw where Conley was go ahead and lean in there exactly what the doctor ordered and that's the veteran in him right there we're casting away from threes we're not hitting anything jumper wise I'm not settling here this is a free throw brod Brooks Carlos remirez Donte Whitner Niners Dolphins 49er pregame live tomorrow at noon on NBC Sports Bay Area the Niners playoff chances are hanging by a thread still there I think everybody's still optimistic about shoter enjoying the Warriors last game yeah he looked like a new guy with a new team like terminology is different everything's different can be tough at times but he is so Dynamic getting downhill pick and role player tremendous pick and role player you'll see that eventually he's an 88% free throw shooter he went one of two Intruder that's a beautiful play Gobert was going to have a dunk there that's him helping the help without fouling too get it from behind set up the three for Edwards and Anthony Edwards is on the board he missed his first eight shots and he got another exaggerated cheer there from the crowd go bear H that last screen tell you if you're Minnesota you're you're pleased it's only 16 Schroder setting up Looney who's crushed another pump fake these pump fakes the fifth most in the league and that's just not understanding how to finish your finishing IQ pump faking floaters like jumping into bodies not avoiding contact all that comes into play when it comes of finishing around the rim second free throw coming your way from Super Cuts Baristas highly caffeinated to finally so Looney one of two from the line step back in Randle back in DiVincenzo three okay they're finding their Rhythm you can feel it coach cerr is like okay we got to about this was a Laker he Atlanta Hawk he played for Brooklyn well he's on the squad now be curry with go hounding him there and Steph dribbles out to the three-point line missed that three that was a tough one Minnesota started to hit some threes and now Edwards working inside an offensive foul used the free arm on Looney to Ward him off take that basket away that's a good right there out here in the first half that's good news they blew their challenges trying to get it Looney a little step under nice L okay they're getting smarter with these finishes man the pump fakes the step throughs these are things you haven't seen enough from the Warriors how about 11 and 12 points and rebounds for Looney and Trayce Jackson-Davis has a combo tonight get great Center productivity as Schroder was called for the foul there I said he was holding on he was just trying to fight through a screen shter saying I got pushed from behind three team fouls each and three personal fouls on Trayce and on shrer and gb2 is coming back in to tag out and take Anthony they say Gary Payton II is they call him the wrestler because he he rides the bike back in the tunnel then when coach ker calls on him he Sprints out of the tunnel and head hunts the other team's best offensive player like a wrestler well remember Gary missed half of last season a lot of it were leg ailments been very durable this year been much Kuminga and Wiggins have played so well defensively and Andrew right there on Randle kicking it out to Buddy Hield warm- up three he got it it's so perfect from Andrew first of all the defensive play to come up with that one get the steal and push it hard get all the way to the Baseline almost draw in buddy Hills Defender kick it back out you can't get any better than that on the reason I mentioned Kinga and Wiggins is because Randle without Draymond Green you've needed Andrew and Jonathan to play well and defensively they have but again pushing get out and transition McDaniels following his own shot to hammer that down that was a frustration dunk pretty impressive just going vertical there Warriors led by 11 at the end of one they held Minnesota 6 minutes without a point trying to rebuild that lead now trying to finish this half strong Wiggins does not have a field goal Anders had such a good season in his former team and he is 0 for five right now doing it defensively not offensively yet Minnesota have a burst here in the final two minutes of the first half stenzo setting up McDaniels spins on Steph to Gobert to duck it down they're making it easy on Gobert this game Monster threatening drives is drawn to help in Warriors are kind of in scramble mode that time tell you this is a big two minutes you're at 15 right now you you've dominated defensively but you're not scoring yet Payton fouled right and Steph misses the free throw oh again they used the fact it's been odd that's been a thing all season with the free throws it's just getting in the gym on working working on it like getting the free throws up it's the same thing with finishing around the basket any part of your game like you just have to to get the Reps in we have highlighted because we played Minnesota now three times in two weeks we've highlighted Rudy Gobert you shooting a career best as he got it up near 80 he's at 74% Payton one of two like the Warriors as a team are giving away so many points at the line no one's above extra work and go speaking of which will go to the line Gary Payton II tried to get over there but he's just a smaller man even though he's got bounced like a big in Gobert's help and you're just trying to help the helper but it's tough when a guy like Gobert has crazy catch radius now Gobert as I said the one field goal attempt against the Knicks and he's got 7 point6 rebounds tonight allstar game is coming to Chase and so the All-Star voting is live presented by Google Cloud your power to send your favorite Warriors and other NBA players for the All-Star Game right in the bay those votes in vote now that was one thing the temp rols were struggling with offensively was driving to finish almost all the time instead of figuring out when you need to drive to make a play for someone else this game they're starting to make a play for someone else and it's go be a lot of the times so Warriors better be aware first of all on ball defense moving your feet make the drives tougher and then helping the helper too so the lead at 14 Wiggins lost the handle and the Warriors don't get a shot up and go ran the floor and he missed a layup but he was fouled I see Julius Randle the Warriors fifth turnover so they've done okay there but it's just timely turnovers that's the thing in some of these games Warriors have had low turnovers they've just had them at the worst times Gobert continues to show that improved free throw stroke hey and when you're in year 12 and you can shoot a career best from the foul line that that's just flat out hard work so this this is what I see from him like last year a lot of the time he would shoot and almost come down as he's releasing now it's more of just one push where he gets up on his toes and he releases at the same time that's one thing coach Cur has been talking to the Warriors about some of the guys that have struggled with their free throw just making it one clean push and one motion going towards the basket final minute 15 of this first half sta bottoming a three much needed go was looking around like what am I supposed to do there I'm up on him so Gobert with 10 curry 11 the two double figure scores Randle on Wiggins no Draymond tonight and now it's just a parade for they go ISO so much and Julius Randle he's going to try to attack especially if he feels like he's got the strength Advantage Andrew Wiggins is in a tough spot all right I'm going to ask you something that it's unknowable but you know you played would you be aware if you were guarding r that he was one of eight shooting and that not fouling him like let's see him make a jumper before I put him at the foul line yeah it's easier said to done though especially if you feel like he has an advantage like he's about to lean in he's got pretty good position in there he's pretty good at all the flip shots around the basket in the moment but yes you're definitely thinking about that trying to keep him off the free throw line and not let him see one go in yeah cuz randle's one of eight and Edwards is one of nine and the free throws now for Minnesota eight of nine you can't lose a quarter where you held a team without a point for 6 minutes St that good Defender McDaniels couldn't finish with the left hand there and then Looney fighting for it Wiggins comes to get the free ball buddy hee open three Warriors continue oh that's a bad foul to foul buy heel pretty good look that Timber rolles did a good job of getting out to contest as well as they could but the Steph is playing with so much energy trying to drive it get in the paint break the paint get the ball movement going you just need some of those to fall you know Christmas next week with the Lakers you have Indiana on Monday and the Lakers on Wednesday can Santa is hard to watch for a month I think they're 24th when it comes to field goal percentage on the season I know and but that's happened this month that just typified this quarter he got a game and gives the Timberwolves defense some credit too but the worriors have missed some open ones Randle that extra opportunity down the lane to flip it up and in and Anderson just jumped to his right just kind of left the ball so the shot clock off and the Warriors now have a officially lost this quarter they have a chance to redeem themselves the final 11 seconds a good fake from Randle skip pass to Podziemski side step open three and Brandon who's been over 40% from three the last six games hits that triple DiVincenzo to end the half and the Warriors will take 30 or something and instead it's only 133 got the foul first that that was to post up Edwards that was exactly Intruder has four Edwards Gobert Julius Randle and Conley and Gobert is the leading scorer in the game he's got 12 points well he was open off that role he knew Anthony Edwards was not passing it so he just Trail he got to the basket pretty easy offensive rebound for him yeah just let's see what the score is under seven minutes of this quarter because the Warriors may have missed an opport in the second quarter they could haunt them for this game Conley so quick with his hands Schroder was looking for the roller who Steph has had a screen for he just forgot about his own Defender yeah randle's got shudder with four fouls on him in a huge size disparity going to walk him into the lane and then throw it away Kyle Anderson to step for three Trayce tried to keep it alive Curry is four of 12 three of 10 on threes that's the NBA fast break I get it with Steph Curry's out there and Edwards laying it up and in he's coming you need to keep that same energy against him you had the first half but he's going to make it tough and shrer Nifty move and finish there's that change of pace little him to sleep go about 20 mph get to 80 ASAP keep us in Pace Warriors want to go quick and Randle back to the line again these are drivers they don't drive enough on the season and Schroder is going to bring that and this is why any level of basketball that you play work on your free throws because Julius Randle is two of nine and yet he's impacting the game because he's a good free throw shooter he's attempted nine free throws or going to and he's in double figures and sometimes it affects guys' games when they know they're not good free throw shooters they get scared to go scared to be as aggressive as they normally would be Julius Randle he puts his head down like a bull you can tell he's not afraid so he's got 11 now seven of nine free throwing a warrior offense going to emerge he played solid D but the ball must go through the basket shrer the mid-range Dennis Schroder at the layup and now the field goal there okay sher's coming on strong McDaniels yeah Minnesota's offense is coming back well he just got not communicating to stayed up he didn't get the help there truder and Trayce Jackson-Davis little two-man game Conley good recovery want to switch that if you can it just happened so quick they set it up nicely the timber wolves did Kyle Anderson to Trayce and go sending that away there's two to shoot will still be Warrior ball well the timber rolles are playing much better now on both ends four time defensive player of the year seven times all defense for now only8 and by rule this you can secure an attempt but you need point three so it would have to be hot potato shooting it won't be disallowed by rule but you can't really catch it and get it off Steph did and so that quick release pays off with a three he kind of took his time there too Anthony Edwards side step three perfect yeah an averages 26 a game you see him with three and a half you're like get ready for the second half and he shoots that three ball so well 42% like we said McDaniels fouling Steph tense ever it was long Warriors will take that then through the mix Wiggins is held and Edwards will pick up a foul yes Steph was setting that back screen for him and the Timberwolves are doing all they could to keep Andrew Wiggins from they flatten Steph out to the sideline whip pass to wiggin open three and Andrew's first field goal tonight that's the perfect spacing you need what a f from Curry there Steph Curry's run all over the place driving the Baseline the whole defense is focused on him you're going to have some open looks off of that again here comes Bowl in a china shop setting up go to lay it up and in big to Big passing Julius Randle is creating Schroder and Trayce now step dipping in you see mcdo what a good Defender shot clock get seven shot clock at three Trayce Jackson-Davis finding Wiggins on the other side and then Julius Randle the rebound here's Randle 100 milph to go bear to dunk it Down single the league settle down see if you can get something going to the basket here out of the timeout they get Wiggins inside he is denied so Andrew against his former team one of eight and Randle bottoms a three here just not getting back and matching up two Defenders with Anthony Edwards there for a second he didn't get any rotation to R they have all the momentum right now the crowd could feel it there Jackson-Davis and Kyle Anderson every time they get in there they see go bear Kyle pulling that rebound he got to get go bear away from the basket someone draw him and kick it or dish sh clock at seven knocked away from shooter Dives on the deck and got a timeout the time points in the first half and had a chance to just blow this game up open they started settling for threes and they have been okay you missed your opportunity and you might need to win this game a second time a different way and it's good to see Andrew Wiggins bought him a couple free throws there was definitely some open looks to Warriors Miss in that second quarter you got to give the Timberwolves defense credit held up enough to keep them in the game Randle on the Baseline back to Gobert and he couldn't handle it Anderson helping recover and anyone in a white jersey start to feel it from the field this a good candidate Steph dribble it out of bounds give Randle credit man he moved his came back right he was still there yeah the Warriors are plus 10 and points off turnovers but you don't want those empty possessions as good as Minnesota's D is you want to get shots up when you can now the Warriors have to rely on their defense good recovery by Wiggins on Edwards shot clock at 12 Mike Conley bottoms of three of course Conley has been shooting 20% the last three games and his first field goal theight well he's a better shooter than that though he's going to come around eventually Ra's Jackson-Davis on the roll and he is fouled got two Defenders staying and Trayce hits the free throw that's what you need though like something go to the rim get to the bass especially if they're going to guard step that way where two stay with him including go bear that's what I said the rim protector his domain is that restricted Circle and eight points at only three in the first half Warriors one of two from the line from Trayce and it's a five-point game Edwards with Naz Reid open three and he got it they're rolling now I said the seven minute Mark I was off by a minute that lead has dwindled CF NBA games this was the second quarter the Warriors missed their chance they're going to have a brand new game here Kuminga from the mid-range I watched him before the game working on that consistently that mid-range off of screens off of drives that looked good thear on the roll he's the decision maker Edwards the open three and Podziemski with the rebound you got to be careful there you don't want to leave Edwards if you don't have to to your Gary Payton II there dominga just walked conly under the basket and didn't get a foul well he treding to come up under his arm didn't work now's Reid on the step through Minnesota has not LED in the game The Warrior lead from 21 down to two the crowd has gone from booing to cheering for their squad Kuminga air ball three and Anthony Edwards a chance to take the lead Edwards on fky driving soaring on the kick out and he's fouled on that pass now Sher four fouls so Anthony Edwards out of the game let's see if you can make hay here going into the fourth quarter Steph is still out on the floor Mel Alexander-Walker with DiVincenzo Naz Reid Jaden McDaniels and go there that ball kicked recycle the shot clock to 14 if he just threw it off the leg without the an intentional extension of the leg that would have just been no kick but as it was rightly called so buddy heel back in how Reid throwing it away B Podziemski running with Kuminga and the Warriors get nothing another block he tried to slow down and and cut off Reid's momentum but Naz Reid gives Minnesota their first lead the night that's a massive sequence fiveo swing the Warriors did this to themselves in the second quarter Steph Curry and he retakes the lead as Steph's got 16 as as spicy and as hot as the Timberwolves were coming in after getting blown out to the Knicks you weren't going to blow them out tonight no no it's just when you have a team dying from the field tougher to do because of that as well yeah they're going to look at that second quarter though the shot selection is something they got away from that beautiful first quarter yeah of running and trying to go inside and the whole this settled for a lot of Castaway threes that aren't going it wasn't great there was some good looks in there too Steph Curry off iron there Looney kept it alive Podziemski with Kuminga on Naz Reid Johnathan Kuminga getting to the mid-range and Looney didn't hit the rim and step will get a layup out of cavon Looney's hard work Looney saw that go had vacated the premises going to contest the the jumper so he's working hard to get the off defensive rebound now's Reid Corner three and tipped up and out tipped up and in McDaniels the second time that can't happen Podziemski three Talia it's seven games now with Brandon over 40% on threes and he is finding his stroke his continuation of last game too your lip reading skills are amazing yeah I heard him I saw him he had all of it basically so Minnesota they couldn't throw it in the land of a thousand lakes in the first half but they're 12 of 16 in the quarter 12 of 17 after the random miss shter little bumper car and he will get to the line again you go get to the free Thro line shooter after boy we're putting our foot down to keep our feet up like way up with Lazy Boy we worked over and I touched on this last game Schroder with his leadership that's what he would do with the German national team like he's galvanizing the troops calling guys together huddle up and that team had fron Vagner Mo Vagner yeah they won the World Cup and then we're beaten by France in the semis of the Paris Olympics and look at him picking out full court he just got tripped he didn't get the call got a tech and Schroder was pretty upset about getting tripped in not getting that call he was trying to bring the ball pressure turn his man move it's okay though you listen it's not a bad idea to probably get fired up as DiVincenzo miss the incidental versus illegal contact that would be incidental contact again sher's fired up or need to be fired up like everybody else needs to kind of follow his lead especially with step off the floor right now how's Reid down the lane well I think you have to look at if you gave any Warrior fan all right you're up four with 2 minutes left in the third you would take it sure after the Dallas Memphis games you would take that glass now now how they got here is odd but you have a four-point lead in the ball on the road inside of two minutes glass half full Podziemski running hook and Brandon py has eight Off the Bench you shot that hook so much last year not as much this year it worked out there now Reid 13 and Randle down the lane pjy it was a wide pin out Podziemski couldn't get over that Randle screen so Looney had to help knowing to get back to Randle double team buddy heel get ball security there for buddy Schroder what a whip pass to Looney sh clock at seven Podziemski around and out Looney fighting for it DiVincenzo comes out of the pack DiVincenzo three well you use the word fight that's the right word it's a dog fight right now on the glass and the Timberwolves are bringing it you got to match their intensity and Podziemski is getting corin's attention there's spillage on the sidelines and there's a a lot of liquid that was over on the court there think yeah that's happened to me a couple times just like even just sweat on the court that's why the ball boys and ball girls are so adamant about getting out there and sweeping up anytime you see any liquid on the ground yeah Steph not finishing this third quarter so one-point lead in the ball buy heel Springs free missing that three you're going to win these type of games these are the shots that have to go down at some point we've been saying that for the month of December for the Warriors those are some of the looks they missed in the second quarter and out of bounds it's still Minnesota ball that will be a backcourt violation and the Warriors will take that extra possession thank you very much is third but they had five all of the first half so they've had three in this quarter alone the Warriors have Podziemski ended the half with the three can you hit a bucket here to end the third buddy for three right on Q massive t-s can't quite freeze it out a little over a second difference but Minnesota's come from 21 down they're more than in the game Randle likes to call his own number here Kuminga not letting Oz Reid squeeze one off initially and that's good awareness by Kuminga two seconds to work with Schroder from midcourt and that will do it so a buddy healed three games recently have struggled there now you got to start this quarter without staff he's kind of backed his the way his minutes were before where he sits out the beginning of the fourth the bench has done well 37 points Off the Bench you need him to show up now buddy off front iron it's Buddy heel Gary pyton with gaban Looney Dennis Schroder and Jonathan Kuminga Conley Anthony Edwards Naz re with go and Donte DiVincenzo and shrewder with the steal n Reid good hustle and then buddy heel dropped the ball buddy Hill sometimes that ball was even fortunate to get to where it did that was that had turnover written all over it Edwards is playing with four fouls he launches a three long and strong and Gobert he is fouled he tried to pass that out and you want to be careful Warrior killer he went one of seven against the Knicks I need to see video of that cuz he's six of 10 tonight for 16 you don't believe it us this guy never misses when he plays the dubs apparently misses against other teams Schroder with to a bear knocking it away Kuminga shot clock at three Johnathan Kuminga couldn't quite B it home Edwards looking for the lead DiVincenzo to the ground it went right to go Looney pinned it behind the backboard shot clock at eight Edwards again creating space getting around Kuminga to lay it up and out long rebound to Looney easy the Warriors don't secure the ball and DiVincenzo misses a three fourth opportunity for Minnesota and go will lay it in and draw foul the worst of every turnovers but the timely turnovers in the worst way like the worst times Gobert is killing the Warriors scoring the ball finally misses a free throw he averages 10 a game he's got 18 he's coming off a three-point game so down one Dominguez been three of 10 shooting there you go he got that I like that he got very intentional on Naz Reid come up under arms didn't get the call that time it was too egregious for them to not call it but you like that instead of looking for a play to get a three or shoot from outside go inside and Kuminga hitting that first free throw you can spend the holidays on Warriors ground kids don't have school anymore in the coming to town Miles Turner and Tyrese Halbert all the tickets available at warriors.com or 888 GSW hoop great home week when you have Indiana Monday Lakers Wednesday and the Phoenix Suns on Friday and Kuminga lasers in both free throws that's a great sign massive Johnathan Kuminga in double figures has 10 Off the Bench you go with Buddy heels 11 Steph's 18 looks like this is going to be a tug of- war from here on out he Naz Reid they run him off the three-point line Conley in open three barely ticked iron and the rebound Gary Payton II scooping it up that's great awareness not giving Naz Reid an open three then gone Naz Reid again trying to use some quickness spins on him pump fake let him foul you again see they're getting back to their game this is what I talking about last game against the against a really good defensive team you need all that more and Kuminga is thinking about that now and you're at the free throw line again there's a lot that everyone wants out of Jonathan Kuminga you got to remember he's 22 years old he has all this ability but you're watching him grow up you know he took some early threes the three ball is should be the almost The Last Resort for him because he can do Dam that not a lot of Warriors can do in this way and you're looking for him to be this like the go-to guy with this unit with certain units out there someone that you can go to and you know he can get us a great shot now he's three of four free throw there he can live with that 75% should be his standard was nearly that last year he's had a very rough free- throwing season dp2 is trying to stay with Edwards the touch pass to DiVincenzo and flipping it up and in that was a clever delivery before Trayce could Elevate he quick shot at him tied at 82 I said probably a minute plus before Steph comes back Schroder with the quick hands of Conley it's still Warrior ball Conley knocking that away Conley can still do it great leader tried the duck into Kuminga the ball was going a hit underneath the backboard it's going to be side out of bounds says Sean Corbin and they'll still remain Warrior come on rter and Trayce and it's Buddy hee with an open three buddy off iron there buddy 11 points but three of eight on threes had a good look there Anthony Edwards the touch pass to Conley for the open three he said he has not been making them long pass to Gary Payton II and he's crushed and Gary checking body parts he will go to the line well that was a good outlet from Buddy hee a lot of contact but he he didn't mean that well hasn't he gotten like teammate of the year like four or five times or something like that so Mike Conley played with Greg Odin in college okay yeah then he ran that Mark cou Zack Randle griton Grime Tony Allen Memphis team then he was in Utah with Gobert and then now here in Minnesota he's had multiple iterations of being a great leader and a great teammate as Gary Payton II drops in both free throws or the sportsmanship award or something he was winning all the time you're just a great great guy Steph Curry coming to the scores table just as we said right around the 8 minutes minute Mark DiVincenzo the skip pass to Reid Donte on the relocate driving on Schroder to put it up an in dento has been good Off the Bench he's got a dozen we're tied at 84 shooter involving Gobert now they got Gobert outside and you've got a foul first I think n k Walker Alexander he sh budy healed okay so you got a you one more fouled you can shoot free throws the whole rest of this game well that all that attacking Kuminga did is going to pay off Curry Off the Bench for three long rebound to Wiggins an extra possession here Kuminga to Trayce dumped it over Gobert created by Kuminga he's dunking on everybody from France he got lyama now he's getting Gobert too he got ret in Washington as well just everybody in France taller than seven feet that was Kuminga creating too though Gobert tried to return the favor and he tried to get is going to be called for foul number five and he did not agree with catch on the move going to your drive and made it tough on Gobert to help and recover Gobert short arm that free throw that was not that Rhythm you were talking about that has given him a career best free throwing this season well last year he'd get up on his toes and it would be like a second delay until he released and so you've just kind of destroyed all that momentum you had and it's all arms at that point so it looks like maybe he's kind of reverting back to that watch no that was pretty good that one was short well I think also he he has a T-Rex finish where he doesn't extend all the way now Trayce Jackson-Davis when you don't have Draymond Green it's Trayce and Looney against the world in the middle Trayce now with five fouls Podziemski trying to break the paint get it back to Wiggins good recovery by Minnesota wigs from the Baseline py flying in tippet hole either crash or get back and Podziemski chose the latter no the the former I meanon 10 points and seven rebounds what a great 16 minutes off the bench for Podziemski monster crash Anthony Edwards perfect for three Wiggins has worked awfully hard on Edwards He's four of 16 and Midway through the fourth onepoint lead in the ball Trayce rolling Trayce banking it in Coach K said it he is the Warriors best finisher R Jackson-Davis 11 points with his seven boards he spends a lot of time in the air he was up high again that time this is where Edwards wants to take over behind the Gobert screen another look at a three got another one yeah Trayce Jackson-Davis was kind of hung up in the lane so they drop coverage Gobert is able to set that screen all kinds of space for Anthony Edwards Kuminga in on and followed in by Trayce Jackson-Davis how about that Kuminga went on Gobert you thought you might have a foul that was Cordy the best yep TJ D's been influential in this game he's back to having his impact Anthony Edwards driving and reversing so Edwards he had eight points through three he's already got eight points here in the fourth quarter by himself that deceleration is lethal we're heading into another clutch game The Warriors have played 16 of them Trayce shck to Davis dunck it before go could catch him listen it happened in the first half where they're trying to bring bring the ball pressure I said if they do that drive it he learned he drove that one Trayce has 15 and the rest of the defense was compromised remember Trayce is playing with five fouls though McDaniels with the big step and he got a foul they're going to call it late on Steph I think they say he didn't hold his Line St Steph hates this it is on Curry she waited till the Miss happened the free throw went with all kind of force that time Jen McDaniels a 71% free thrower Minnesota 11 of 18 from the line the Warriors 13 of 19 clutch minutes here we are again you're seven- n two and seven in your last nine clutch games clutch game plus or minus five points inside 5 minutes here we go again with a one-point lead in the ball can you execute skip pass Podziemski didn't want that three he'll shoot the short floater Podziemski five of nine and he's got a dozen in the Mavericks game a similar play happened where he pump faked and he picked up his dribble trying to step back into a three that time eat up to real estate go if they're giving it to you go Anthony Edwards we said already eight of his 16 here in the fourth Wiggins tying him up and quick timeout by Minnesota that's a great double team using the half best plus minus behind Steph tonight at plus 13 that's the thing no one's going to give you wins in this league you got to go get it you got to earn it Warriors are trying Edwards fouled on that drive he came up underarms like James Harden that time that's some Edwards out but the ball must go through the basket look at the first seven games like they were doing it we're executing we got to do this Edwards want up two from the line and Trayce with the rebound you remember that Draymond was the one that was handling when Steph set that ball screen in the one they won at Chase against the T wolves McDaniels hounding step TR sets the screen Curry an open three he got it so staff's got 21 and up five oh the screeners defender was just preoccupied with all the action going on in the paint Steph came off there with tons of space Randle on Edwards and Ant-Man missing the three tried to guide in was McDaniels and Minnesota took it out of bounds where probably by all right should have had five wins in the stretch only have two and McDaniels knocked it away from Steph but he was he fouled him in the process well Warriors are looking ahead going and then the timu is being a little overaggressive at times now you got free throws all you got to do is continue to attack if you can take advantage of these get a few cheap ones you know who Steph does not want to see in 15 days Jaden McDaniels three times the Timberwolves I mean I I give McDaniels such great credit it's 69201 he's in year five well he has the same mentality a lot of players have you're finishing up a tough stretch but there's going to be tough games coming cuz teams seem to play their best against the Warriors and the Warriors know like hey we we got to bring our a game because if we start out slow like we've seen the Warriors do in the past like every team can get going even the terrible ones push the lead to seven after Curry's two made free throws Julius Randle banging and bumping on Wiggins and Wiggs blocks the shot and Ricochet is off randle's leg and the Warriors take over what a block Andrew Wiggins the fact that he hasn't been going offensively has not made it to where he's lacking it three again half a three two free throws another three and a 10-point lead the closer back DiVincenzo in out up and good you got to keep going though you want to relax here get complacent you need to keep scoring in Denver you were up six with a minute and a half in Houston you're up six with a minute and a half you're up eight coming down to two minutes here Schroder didn't want that three give it to the hottest Warrior Curry's got another one three threes in the last two minutes and step steel they call it a foul it's going to be a foul in the back court but you knew Steph Curry would have an answer listen Warriors have done a pretty good job taking care of the ball on their side offensively you've struggled in the past in clutch minutes pretty good so far now you just need to be solid defensively DiVincenzo is that a really nice game Off the Bench Donte has been averaging only eight points a game shooting 36% and six of nine shooting and bottoms both free throws we talking about how influential Steph is DiVincenzo always points to how influential Steph has been with his game and his shooting you want to use almost the whole shot clock every trip down just limit the number of possessions left in this game shot clock down to eight Curry floating it up and out rebound tip and DiVincenzo comes up with it and Schroder knocked it away Edwards gets it and another loose ball foul that this is a disaster for the ball even if Minnesota were to score you want him using 15 20 seconds if possible and Edwards dropping that in seven in a loss yeah so it's all about if the Warriors score seven-point lead in and a half left and acquiring shooter means step can play off the ball here and now he's got it on the good Defender McDaniels dp2 brings Naz Reid on Gary Payton II love to Wiggins yeah two Defenders stay with Steph hockey assist for him the rest is history great Play by Gary would been the Draymond middleman there Edwards blocked by Wiggins he did it again what a defensive night for Andrew Wiggins didn't have it going going offensively until late with the dunk and a lay in and the Warriors push it to double Figures it's only right that Andrew Wiggins gets to see some go in aerial assault on the rim before that one DiVincenzo three right through and Minnesota's not done Schroder and step see it's a second ball handler to play with and Curry is foul it to dunan what has it been good with their turnover taken care of it here lately in this game well the Warriors very quietly are 12th in the league in turnovers okay so Steve instead of 28 29th they're getting shots up and tonight is at 46% which is much more Warrior like the Warriors going negative Nathaniel talking about them in the second quarter oh they did it to themselves they this game twice Warriors are still fighting missing there you can chastise me in a 10-point lead this is a big win man for team Denver Houston Minnesota Minnesota at Houston Dallas at Memphis at Minnesota yeah they wanted this one so bad well eight of the next nine are going to be at Chase Center Naz Reid misses what a game for Trayce Jackson-Davis and Podziemski and the Brilliance of Steph Curry 31 points 10 assists the Warriors for is
