 backing for Success courtesy and my fitness pal are great friends over there as a Warriors win the offensive rebound battle fezy fil offensive rebound well the Pacers are bottom 10 in the league and rebounding so you got to make sure you attack them on the rebounding this is one thing that you can win tonight is all effort Bonte and tonight it is imperative they win the points off turnovers Battle Points off turnovers offensive rebounds you got to win The Possession battle those offensive rebounds a lot of times turn into open threes to set the tone last night we're going to need several players to follow suit tonight to beat this Pacer Team No Doubt make those 18 to 23 point shots they average about 15 M threes a game hey give me some Lindy Waters he stays with the strap on him right Gui Santos Moses Moody buddy buckets let him fly tonight big fell you're greedy man 18 to 23 something means you need them from Gui Santos you need them from Lindy Waters you need some from buddy my need some from Kyle Anderson man all right let's go BL dog gets out there Let it Fly too the heck with it and you know this Pacer team wants to get up and down the floor with tremendous pace so really for both teams which team can play with Pace but also take care of the basketball at the same time and we know our play-by-play announcer Bob Fitz J will be in a very good mood because another day fighting fighting Irish are going to the national championship game what a game down in the Orange Bowl in Miami as a Outlast pin State 27 to 24 and if fits his honor I've been wore a dark green suit I feel like I'm part of the Fighting Irish right now I'm ready to go to South B Fitz I'm surprised Fitz is in IND Indianapolis you're not celebrating with Marcus is Freeman right now Molly knows there's a little Irish in all of us it's all come together for America's team come on and Chuck Hayes pulling for Notre Dame yesterday f is so fit is so high right now I'm just trying to pull him down right need to keep him down on the ground he's up in the clouds somewhere but I'm thinking about this game Fus talk to me about how annoying it is trying to deal with someone like a Gui Santos someone that just brings that Steph Curry even said like a Josh Okogie someone that just sneaks in there always getting their hands on ball deflections Second Chance points the extra possessions like that's what they come in the game Infuse that energy like if you're on the other side of that if you're the Pacers tonight in the Warriors bring that with Gui all the guys that get an opportunity how hard is that to deal with when you're trying to keep a guy off the glass that's throwing Juke moves at you like you're not just going to box me out that easy well Buie when you have a guy like Gui Santos and you're going against him you got to understand he's not going to get a lot of minutes normally if the full roster is here so his job is to go as hard as he can every possession and if you're a guy in the game going against him that is annoying that's you know that's every box out that's every time R sprinting down the floor that's making sure that you feel him every time defensively if he's your teammate you're excited because he brings energy to the floor and the Warriors have been lacking that of late so having him on the floor last night especially that was huge you're going to lead a lot more of that tonight against Indiana Molly I think that with Dennis Schroder not having Steph next to him it's back to that pick and roll stuff that Schroder run his whole life and with Trayce Jackson-Davis finishing with Looney spelling him and then the one guy we left out post is here in terms of shooting thre so might be pick and fade but how about Schroder as a pick and roll guy and that's somewhere to go with the Warriors kind of battered and banged up but at least offensively they could run that a lot against Indiana yeah Fitz I think that's a great Str stry he can control Tempo on this back to back with limited players available we saw him do against the Warriors when the Nets beat the Warriors here at Chase Cent he controlled the total fourth quarter so I think tonight controlling Tempo keeping the turnovers down on Dennis Schroder more than capable of doing that also think last night we saw him do a great job defensively on Cade Cunningham in the first half if he could just slow Haliburton down you're not going to stop him but slow him down and keep this game close give yourself a chance at the end or maybe steal it and you're also just hoping that human nature kind of hits the phers you're like they got guys down like oh maybe they're not going to say that outward but you know just that's human nature right and for the Warriors how many easy buckets can you get talk about the fast break points the second chance points about cutting to the rim off of screens the split action cuz you're just trying to keep it simple with your pick and roll your split action the plays everybody knows right but just celebrating screening see how many easy buckets you can get and just keep the game close like you're saying Molly yeah I I think you know Rick Carlile is in his locker room right now just go my good this is the worst game for me because all these guys are out human nature kicks in and we don't play our best basketball so the Warriors can take advantage of that if they go out and play like Gui Santos did last night go out and really establish your energy your effort and then hopefully the made threes uh and and the style of play and then Dennis Schroder can keep that pace to play the way they want it all right fellas have a great call out there in Indiana see if the Warriors could win back toback games here the road to start this 4 game Road Trip have a good call guys I tell you what we just broke down what you call in sports a free swing there's only 10 healthy Warriors you have Pat Spencer and pul know they're going to play Gui Santos going to play a lot there's no pressure on you listen you want a game in Detroit okay Steph and Draymond are out take that free swing it's an opportunity you get to play an NBA game the guys that are available to play like you said only 10 available go back to their High School mentality right just come out of here do work you know you got to stay in the game so it's about just taking advantage of the opportunity making sure you start the game off with that same type of energy that intensity that Gui Santos brought Everybody follow Gui Santos's lead what he did last night see if you can stay in the game quarter by quarter yeah and I think that for the Warriors they got a lot of Good Vibes in that win in Detroit because they had two very popular teammates play so well our Ford plays of the day he Santos and Kevon Looney were all over everything they're beloved on this roster and I think it fueled their energy if you bring Gui Santos's energy what he did last night the Pacers may not know what hit him and human nature May set in from the jump but the Santos like yeah the threes are kind of a bonus but what he does is he just infuses energy with his intensity getting deflections getting his hands on 50/50 balls and then Looney comes into the game and he's Mr steady edti he know he's going to get the offensive rebounds in the second chance points you know he's going to be setting wonderful screens you know his IQ is going to be there you know he's going to be super solid defensively they can depend on him for that so everybody is happy to have Looney back in the brain no matter who's available to play when you look at how you catch a Pacers team they've won four in a row 11 of 14 and every team in the NBA wants a big three well Indiana has that and they're playing their best basketball of the year when you have Pascal Siakam Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner three quality players that always seem to give the Warriors a lot of problems Pascal Siakam he's kind of the Ying to their Yang he's going to inside a good amount he goes ISO his post game may have to double team at times Haliburton he's more aggressive lately right he's going to be in charge of controlling the game and their pace and Myles Turner you have to know where he is yes at all times really on both sides of floor he's got the pick and Pops he may have to rotate to his pick and pops and he can roll the basket on the other side he's blocking shots got to know where he is when you're trying to finish around the rim jump into him pump fakes get him away from the basket beat him to the rim if you can get up and down fast break points will be huge tonight the NBA game today is all about the three-point shot and so you have a chance if you have three-point Shooters they can put up big numbers now you don't have Steph Curry tonight but buddy hee has made more threes in The Last 5 Years than anyone in the league former Indiana Pacer he's got the greenest of green lights tonight only 10 healthy Warriors back out of a back to back bring it on free swing with vat and the guys back in the studio coming up next back home again in Indiana this was taken earlier before the snow hit Indianapolis basically the Warriors taking on the Pacers for the second and final time this year Indiana redot having one four in a row and 11 of 14 warriors with a really nice win in Detroit on the back Tob backs they will not have Stephen Curry or Draymond Green it is a homecoming for Trayce Jackson-Davis who grew up about 20 minutes outside of Indie and he's going to get the opening tap and start here and for the Warriors everybody that's got a uniform on knows they're going to play some minutes tonight that's it how long can you stay in the game how much can Dennis furder control the game you're going to see a lot of pick and rolls with him but anybody that wants the ball out the opportunity is there and for this Pacer team much better offensively they're about their points in the paint yeah they're a good three-point shooting team but they're going to drive you're going to have to guard a lot of pick and rolls you got your hands full so Schroder with Lindy waters getting the start Trayce Jackson-Davis Buddy hee and Lindy opens missing that three for Indiana Tyrese Haliburton Nembhard with Bennedict Mathurin Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner I think Nembhard is one of the best defensive guards in the NBA and when he got healthy the Pacers kind of took off Miss three there especially defensively with him slow mo getting the opportunity to start but Trayce Jackson-Davis giving buddy Hield another chance and that way half one down and out attacking and flipping it up and in art with the first Pucket of the ball game he's going to be super aggressive know about his three ball but here's where I'm impressed with him his defensive intensity is going to bring the pressure and he's got a big task with dealing with Schroder Lindy Waters Another open three and the Warriors are going to have to have a night where they bury some of these Indiana will let you they'll give you looks you could score on the Pacers and that'll be a travel well the defensive side for the Pacers is is where they can be had at times it's interesting their starting lineup this current starting lineup there's Rick Carlile they've been amazing defensively almost dominant defensively but it's been their bench where they've struggled at times they're actually last in the league an opponent field goal shooting for the bench yeah Carlile one of seven active coaches over 500 wins in his career 23 years as an NBA head coach buddy back to Trayce and Trayce Jackson-Davis welcome back to Indiana and put Myles Turner in a tough position make him guard pick and roll have to help stab at the drive and fall backwards but Trayce Jackson-Davis is too tenacious when he rolls D hard handling shot clock it eight Tyrese Haliburton hiding behind Turner try switched onto him step back partially blocked that Trayce Jackson-Davis moved his feet and then blocked the shot that's a win for Trayce Jackson-Davis Schroder with a shot clock at 11 get Siakam on a switch but he terminated the dribble Buddy Hield at five and Schroder for three what's going on with that Rim down there Warriors have a bunch of these buckets going in out Rattle and won't stay can't get discourage but shoter did the right thing just moving without the ball his man lost side of him for a little bit pasalo inside outside in the post in transition great mid-season acquisition a year ago signed the big extension to stay here he's got so much game and that's one of the reasons he's so consistent he can rely on that postgame slowmo hit the side of the backboard and the Warriors have open over for five from distance Neymar got caught up had it knocked away and Haliburton fouled well he did the right thing not letting the Warriors off the hook after Nembhard got in the paint broke the paint the whole defense had to collapse you get an awkward close out and Haliburton is driving that he had the weird start to the season maybe not as aggressive but lately he's been so much more aggressive he actually said you shoot it more they go in more and his percentages have gone up when it comes to his three-point shooting his field goal percentage but just more attacking from him and if he's aggressive as a point guard you don't have to be aggressive to score it's aggressive to make plays Harlem Globe TRS coming to chase Center January 19th all the tickets available at Chase center.com if any of the Globe Trotters are available to shoot distant shots the Warriors would take them right now give them some time let him get warmed up it's freezing outside Schroder another three and Trayce Jackson-Davis offensive rebounds that's the one area you can get at Indiana now pick and roll that pass behind him Grace could handle it Mathurin in full flight and putting it up an in the confident maen and he's got the change of pace the deceleration in his game too he had the laborum issue last year after March 9th and didn't play the rest of the Year this is year two for very talented player out of Arizona Lindy Waters or are get all the threes they would want their tracking down some of the misses Buddy Hield on the Baseline saw Turner foul him there look Kyle Anderson this is one thing the Warriors can do especially in a game like this where they're missing a lot of shots how many Second Chance points can you get how many extra possessions can you get Kyle Anderson we saw that last night with Gees Santos talked about how many battles can you win and and Gees Santos won a million battles last night Kyle Anderson just won a battle there just go ahead and get that second chance opportunity fire in there A lot of times you can go from the corners that's one pretty opportune place to go from cuz it's you have to say it NBA players a lot of times nowadays they just don't box out they don't find bodies they watch the ball in the air I think you're right on the money is that you got a techical foul here is Schroder I think they're going to give it they're going to give it to Nembhard you're right there there was definitely some conversation going on there I don't think I've ever seen a technical where after the guy gets a technical he's this calm hard you would never know they gave one to each so you you saw the first I saw the second so it's offsetting t as Nembhard and Schroder were not having apparently a pleasant conversation so that's basically a double Tech is basically guys chill out yep about enough they Mar down the lane to lay it up and in but the question now Schroder can't get a second T the Warriors don't have enough bodies he's got to be careful Kyle Anderson breaking the paint there tough take for slowmo to put it up and in did you see where Siakam was when he caught that ball Kyle Anderson saw that I'm not going to let him off the hook maybe a tough contested three go and eat up that real estate oh there's Haliburton at his best look draw the foul he'll flip that in but Thea mentioned there were games where Tyrese was taking five six shots a game and now you see him impose his will there did you see where Siakam had to come from that is an awkward close out and even with slow Mo's slowness he's going to get there with his deceleration his body control and Halton is Perman at people he's talking crazy to people after that one he's hyped up probably trying to set the tone for his team not to have a let down here with so many guys out for the Warriors He's got five early toes Tyrese Haliburton race Jackson-Davis spinning in the lane with the left hand and he is fouled and Trayce an opportunity to shoot two free throws like that action from Trayce the more you can get him downhill him being aggressive making Myles Turner defend on the ball and not just be able to roam off the ball and go and block people's shots and come from the weak side like you got to deal with a threat out here Trayce Jackson-Davis showed him that time and also too you pick up two fouls on Myles Turner and Rick Carlile has a decision in terms of you want him to get three in the first quarter TR bottoming the free throw and that's big actually all right Kena you ready yes Gui Santos has checked in Gui Santos Gui last night was just fantastic with 13 points in 26 minutes and enough energy to Pilot the plane from Detroit to Indianapolis last night endless motor Timeout on the floor with the paint the Warriors are 0 for seven on threes and 13-7 Advantage for the Pacers our Kia player profile now look at Trayce Jackson-Davis and his last 11 games the assertiveness the finishing ability and the numbers have been there and here two just getting better and better he can be so physically imposing at times it can be demoralizing for the opponents it's just him staying there with his mentality whatever it takes for him to to finish that strong all the time we talked about him being aggressive I think a game like this is a game he can use to just get himself there mentally I'm going to be aggressive every chance I get never miss an opportunity like I just said make Myles Turner defend or whoever's guarding him buddy Hield just whispering in his ear nobody liked you you lasted to the 57th pick they didn't want you in Indiana bro whatever it takes I mean Michael Jordan was an extreme version of this but he would lie to himself tell himself whatever he needed to tell himself to get himself get himself mad he Santos has to deal with Pascal Siakam and you can't play him any better than that siakam's just that good he got a good angle the way he's able to get into your chest and then fade away he's going to get that separation got such great footwork with that Buddy Hield attacking nice finish there he just rejected that screen the defender was kind of shading him that direction he's like great news when you say reject the screen tell people what you mean yeah you got the screen happening on one side the screener Defender is going to be on the other side of that screen as Trayce Jackson-Davis is able to get a steal over through it though what a great hustle play by Anderson how did the Warriors get that Lindy Waters hits the three save that highlight play a steal a near throwaway but tracks it down and Waters buries the triple defense turns to offense and again you're just trying to keep it as close as you can only down two now how many little battles are you going to win Steve K talked about aine so explosive but he bothered him and Thomas Bryant good steady veteran acquired just a couple weeks ago putting that in well they're the 29th worst offensive rebounding team in the league got to do your work and keep people off the the glass shot clock at eight buddy an open three just off iron there these are the looks you want though amard hides behind Bryan then Schroder will commit the foul there he was just in a tough position trying to deal with Bryant and Bryant did the right thing made himself as big as possible defense to offense active hands get your hands up no ball fake Warriors have seen this kind of bite them and turn it on the Pacers get your hands active save that one tight rope it that was well done throw it back to Lindy Waters Lindy Waters stays ready you know Lindy Waters is going to let it fly he's going to give himself an opportunity to have a big game Obi toppin and Ben Sheppard have checked in Obi Toppin can fly Obi Toppin worked on his three-point shooting too Yes Albert and Skip pass and I mentioned Obi Toppin has worked on his three-point shooting but missed there I think he h he's trying to prove you're right well done Pat Spencer is going to play a lot tonight because Schroder on the back end of a back to back as Pat Spencer just off the bench and into the bucket hits a three shot that with confidence everybody in blue knows they're going to play tonight there's only 10 guys and Quenton post has been brought up from Santa Cruz you want Bryan shooting threes not that he can't make them but look at the rest of the Firepower the Pacers have Wy Waters cycling it around Gui Santos good movement patience and finish it's just a great cut and Nembhard was just kind of trotten behind him to fall asleep defensively I I mentioned cutting when we were talking of Molly and Festus like it's it's something the Warriors can do and again the defensive side of the floor is where the Pacers can be had Baseline jumper misfiring there Nembhard couldn't hit it the Warriors pushing it back with the lead and P Spencer he's got a three and a dunk yes I'm telling you let human nature take its hold the Pacers are looking at the Warriors going they have men down we should have this game and the Warriors is competitive as they are they concede nothing Indiana takes time four 12 minute games if they can look at it that way and break this game down well the Warriors are winning this one by three right now three-point lead and Kena had talked about Tyrese Haliburton when he kind of enforces or imposes his stardom you get the Pacers playing better a Royal Caribbean Starwatch the last 13 games Haliburton is led the way and that's why they're 10 and three yeah much more aggressive making more plays he's back to being himself basically learned a lot from this summer as humbling as it was I think it's made him a better leader overall he can relate to more people on his team now you want to talk energy and you want to talk being a pest defensively TJ McConnell has checked in everybody would want TJ McConnell on your team he knows how to set things up he can score a little bit drops that in and on defense you better be careful with the ball challenge for Pat Spencer here Leon Looney's first playing time Moses Moody he's not playing back Tob backs but an opportunity there Gui Santos pulled it short Here Comes Haliburton running with McConnell it's the right cut he made though the inside is open ryant was posting up Gui Santos did well to front him and then mes has knocked it out of bounds till Indiana ball yeah Moody coming with energy it's energy on energy right now McConnell Pat Spencer but you're the Warriors you're leading the game you're shooting only 38% yeah that's because you're doing a lot of good things Indiana's 57% from the field Haliburton and show go float how about that Tyrese Haliburton has seven what a pretty finish yeah he's going I can't have an off game if I have a bad shooting game that's fine but I have to be aggressive to make plays get in the teeth of the defense make could play for myself or someone else he Santos with a big shot blocker and Obi Toppin Moses Moody attacking had it knocked away good play by Ben Sheppard mconnell how did he get an angle there Steve K says okay we can get up and down get there before the Pacers get set and Pat Spencer is spilled Pat Spencer tried to return the favor McConnell he's doing what their team usually does a lot of drives anytime they see an opportunity to to get by someone just like Haliburton did there with an kna close out from Pat Spencer they're driving in there I believe they're eighth in the league in drives that's one of the reasons they get a lot of points in the paint they don't like to settle like their three-point attempts are down even though they they shoot a great percentage from three-point range but they never rely on it Moses Moody good look at a three the Warriors that's the one thing they haven't done yet hitting threes two of 11 right now they started last night one of 10 mconnell another mid-range and he's more dangerous attacking and dishing he can score but you'll live with that a little bit and you got a better contest there better than the last time he shot his mid-range that's Spencer down the lane tried to throw it back to Moses who track it down and then couldn't quite grab it they tried to run the pick and pop with Looney and Looney cross pass with him his Defender kind of opened up maybe you just go ahead and trust your in between game there go float game tried to force the pass back out to Moody who is kind of replacing the role Jarace Walker was getting ready to sub in and to get a foul off the ball here as Haliburton and Pat Spencer Collide I told you they're going to run a lot of this type of action where there's exchanges rub screens ball screens just trying to get angle to get drives which is what they want to do they want to get downhill on you continue to put pressure on the defense the eighth pick of 2023 the one year in Houston for jerus Walker as Haliburton sits with his seven points fourth Warrior team foul Indiana's committed three will be Toppin have get knocked away but it goes right to Sheppard and Sheppard from the Baseline and that's just an unfortunate bounce of the ball he's solid it is basically a deflection he kind of lost it it worked as a great kick out Kyle Anderson played point guard his whole life growing up as a kid and so he'll run things a little bit and Steve Kerr's going to use a timeout so minute 24 remaining in the first break the game into segments know that you're deep answered by eight straight by the Pacers in a five-point lead dash pass by door Dash is your door to All Things basketball and the Hooser state is all about basketball when you think about IU you think think about the Pacers great college but amazing high school basketball the movie hooers is just incredible about Hickory High School tell the Pacers are trying to finish this quarter pretty strong Moses Moody on the wheel there putting it up and in beautiful delivery by Kevon Looney you can use Kevon Looney as a hub let him initiate your movement cut off of him I tell you the play Steve C designs out of timeouts they're fantastic and then the Pacers throw it away that Spencer has Bryant on him but he picked up the dribble and Looney is foul he had Ben Sheppard on him and Looney recognized it right away he just gave his teammates a Target see if he can Bo him up gained Advantage there during the timeout Steph Curry came and talked to Pat Spencer I'm just it's such a cool thing to watch who who was the Hall of Famer or big time guy that would give you advice was it Baron Davis Baron Davis Baron Davis Jason Richardson too and those guys especially Baron Davis took me under their wing as the Warriors aren't able to get that one to go now the Pacers have two for one Moody shot it long and strong and mconnell down the lane and he didn't make the layup Warriors had the rebound but then Ray aosta had the foul and McConnell to shoot two but it's so helpful when you're a young guy and the veterans come over especially the big time guys the stars in this league the guys that have established themselves and they talk to you about not just basketball but just life how to be a professional how to handle the stuff off the court how to handle people coming at you and everything comes that comes with being an NBA player so TJ McConnell seventh in the league in six-man voting a year ago this is year 10 at 62190 undrafted remember him in Philly he was part of the process years when they were losing all those games and and at that time I was like this guy plays so hard who wouldn't want him on a team and he's found a home in Indiana and played very well and I think he was having a little running conversation with Draymond Green on the bench had a few Choice words for him had a good time with it P Spencer now I'm going to tell you what Steph told Pat Spencer during that timeout it was what you said when you drive in like that don't be afraid to shoot it absolutely don't throw it back out there yeah trust that in between game it's exactly what you had just said yeah sometimes you have to go to that there's T of a second difference game and shot clock winding down this first quarter Spencer has seven Off the Bench by the way McConnell driving from the Baseline Warriors forc the Miss and that will do it Looney from 3/4 court but you're okay so far so good four 12 minute games you got 10 guys the Pacers have won 11 of 14 in four in a row no step no Draymond no Wiggins no Kena no Gary Payton II Brandin Podziemski so far no problem down only three after the first 12-minute game Indianapolis Bob and Kena with you on the road trip tons of dub Nation here Warrior shop item of the game presented by rington saved 30% off the iot G30 off the bay black te's and men and women's I think sometimes they like to mess with you on the 25% 30% off they're going to have to talk to people I know people that know people Harris Walker that pass behind Thomas Bryan Trayce Jackson-Davis did a great job of just getting his hands up making the pass a little tougher the Gui Santos experience moves around the Midwest he hits the three it continues The Legend Continues that's their third three it's a tough cover for Moses and Siakam I just don't know how you deal with him he's so big and he's so skilled so comfortable down there list him at 68 but he weighs 245 so he gets to where he wants on that low block it takes his time you may want to double team him especially with this lineup and and tyree's Haliburton not out there and Myles Turner not out there so Moses had the right idea there but wait a minute that's off that's off Bryant's leg Ed Malloy needs some help here from his compadre they gave him a timeout coach Kerr hadn't signaled the challenge yet Moses went to return that pass to Trayce it definitely looked like it was off on Bryant right went on Bryan's leg and everybody on the floor saw what we saw Edo gave him the timeout before he signaled a challenge but here's a quick look at it watch Thomas Bryant Golden State call time it looked like it hit off his leg from where we're at now the Warriors are going to challenge this and did that ball change direction it sure looked like it we'll have the result coming up we saw that go off Thomas Bryant's leg the replay review there is clear conclusive video evidence that the ball last touches Bryant's left leg prior to going out of bounds therefore it's a successful challenge it'll be Golden State ball with eight on the shot clock we saw this the ball definitely changes Direction ever so slightly but right off the side of Ryan's leg and I do like the fact that the Warriors are letting multiple guys run pick and rolls was a right play by Moses if it wasn't off Brian's leg Trayce would have had a dunk buddy missing that three and Siakam with the rebound he got to stop Pascal Siakam in the open floor gets who knocked it away Gui Santos from behind he Sprints back Moody sprinting into the lane to float it up and and there's your in between game he didn't go all the way to the rim Thomas Bryant isn't as good of a shot blocker as Myles Turner but he's a threat down there he's a presence go ahead and go to your floater all started by Gui Santos hustling and deflecting Gui Santos again knocked it away look at the Pacers get back defensively Schroder thought he had something early get your spacing right here longer the Warriors hang in the game the more the belief system starts to work out and Buddy Hield couldn't get that layup Moses the offensive rebound to a cutting Gui Santos to get to the line cuts at the right times his Defender is focused on the ball watching Moses Moody take advantage cut he's been the main cutter so far Gui Santos look at the Poke from behind Gui Santos just kind of crossed over the other side and reached in with his right hand and then you're just there you're you're ready you're ready to help your teammates get your hands active after you come over to help be at the right place at the right time it's moving on a string Gui Santos is everywhere it's a little thing as Gui misses the free throw when Moses got that offensive rebound I can hear you say take a beat and then that beat allowed Gees Santos to cut down the lane sometimes the offensive rebound Warriors get so frenetic they either throw it away or don't get a quality play out of it yeah when you take your time that that allows things to open up like we're saying and that middle is open and Gui Santos sees it so we've had three ties had three lead changes McConnell knocked Away by Moody Warriers are active right now they're trying to stay in this game as long as possible they have their nose out in front right now so Schroder and Buddy Hield with Gui Santos Moody and Trayce Jackson-Davis Myles Turner back in but he had those TW two quick fouls and allowed the Warriors to get back in the game Pascal Siakam deflected by Schroder shot clock at seven comes mccon again Ben Sheppard out of the corner and Trayce with the rebound Warriors are on it defensively right now he Santos he just shuffled the feet he had the right idea with the show and go but just the footwork not appropriate trying to make sure he didn't let him off the hook but Moors defensively they're switching decisively good heart aggressive defense moving their feet ready to help each other Walker attacking and then buddy Hield gave ground didn't foul him nothing easy at The Rim Al Turner has buddy out on a switch he goes by him and couldn't get an angle on that layup he had beaten the shot blocker but he knew Turner was behind him he just came with so much speed he couldn't slow his body down and his hands down and Sheppard missing there the Warriors are in this game leading at 38% shooting Indiana's is at 52% from the field almost doesn't make mathematical sense McConnell knocking it away still Warrior ball the one thing the Warriors have done pretty well is take care of the ball for the most part so they' given themselves opportunities even though they haven't shot the ball well from the outside they're plus seven in points off turnovers and they've taken seven more shots than the Pacers and and they're not really settling even though the three ball hasn't gone I haven't seen too many shots I'm like Ah that's not a great look that's a low percentage contested three Dr clock at seven Schroder and Trayce Trayce in the pocket with the left and just couldn't Bank it in the Warriors are going to regret these there some point blank looks I know Turner's a shop blocker but they got to find the bottom a little bit aine get it back out to Haliburton and now Z wants it again because he's got Schroder on the switch buy he bothered him enough shot clock in one zakum recognized late and still made the bucket Pascal Siakam four for four he's been their best offense picked up the dribble that good Defender Nembhard do as good a job on Steph as any player in the league e Santos shot clock at five nowhere to to go Trayce taking his time there couldn't RI it home so Trayce Jackson-Davis is getting the shots the Warriors would like Siakam three he finally misses you like the pace and Tempo on the back end of a back to back down bodies the Warriors are still playing hard and fast they can't get three to go to save their life right now three of 15 again I like this shot selection Siakam fouled got to make sure you don't get frustrated with the misses and don't be surprised by it keep your intensity and your effort up I think if you're Steve CS you you just kind of look at guys the only stat we care about is the score absolutely we're iname it's a onepoint game don't worry about who's missing shots don't worry about shooting 33% right now well they're 0 for seven from three-point range atherin what a tough take but they're getting inside 20 points in the paint for them 2014 points in the paint Advantage but still single possession game Kyle Anderson kicking it back out cycle to Schroder buddy giv go and had it knocked away good defense by Indiana Close Quarters Katherine finding Haliburton for three and he got it first three of the night for Indiana that's if you turn it over against the Pacers good night and that's when they really Excel Myles Turner now is bothering everything inside Kyle Anderson missing Mathurin in three rebound ricocheting all the way out nearly to midcourt mat another three Steve Kerr going to use a timeout it's just an inability to finish inside that's kind of hurt him all year that's fighting him here and now you see the Pacers starting to get a little separation here the their last shots building the nine-point lead AR Kaiser Permanente lead the way the longest current tenures with only one team Stephen Draymond people know that but gavon Looney's on that list Myles Turner's on that list yes he is guys move around a lot in the NBA but three of the dubs very long tenard and I I love Myles Turner I just think he's such a great player he's led the league in blocks twice he's going to give you 15 and seven you see him changing shots for the dubs and they don't bother ways a 39% three-point shooter and the more you listen to his teammates they always talk about how great of a teammate he is I remember when he first came in the league one of the years wars were in the finals against the Cavaliers in Cleveland I had dinner with him and a few other people and I was like this is a good dude he gets it man he's got his head on straight going to have some success in the league I think I was right how's auki always looking for a free meal let's see how that works well that's the main point of the whole thing you're going to get a free meal tomorrow night in Toronto courtesy of Trayce Jackson-Davis let's do it P Spencer a career best nine points for Pat Spencer tonight that jumper looks really smooth he gets really good elevation on that but he's got the pull-up game going Mathurin cutting and oh buddy Hield knocked it away but there will be a foul Budd he thought he got that very clean that that was the right idea though from maen Hield was in a tough position just helping because of the Halton Drive swipe down there's a lot a ball maybe a little hand arm it's not not free throws it's only the Warriors second team f Indian committed one Looney playing the D took it from Turner sometimes you can just throw that ball pressure on they don't expect it tell you what throw it somewhere where Nembhard is not such a good Defender he had bottled up buddy there quickly shot clock at seven Spencer reversing it up and out Looney fight for that rebound Looney still fighting and then he tried to tip it up and in I mean the Warriors are shooting 33% in the game and they're still in the game and then that's a fouling Myles Turner that's what happens sometimes in transition they're just bad matchups Pat Spencer was trying to deal with Turner inside had him hemmed up the help had to come all they could do was foul him Myles Turner is also one of those big Lego guys Star Wars he's got like I think he's got got a a statue of himself built out of Legos do you ever do that as a kid you do a bunch of Legos I was all into Legos me and my brothers we build planes cities whatever we could but he's still into and it's something he does as his pastime something he does to keep his Joy you can get all your highlights analysis live updates and Lego information podcast episodes and NBC Sports Bay Area app you can download it now I I got the kids all Legos right yeah and then I ended up stepping on all those little things bare feet all the time my brother still has a scar on his forehead from falling on Legos when we were just forcing forcing around household be Gui all the Legos in one room and then that's your playroom my dad doesn't have to go in there Legos are great Lego Land out in San Diego super fun yeah get the building stuff going Looney with a naked hand off and F Turner erase that slowmo picking it back up buddy Hield with three on the shot clock and Pat def or the offensive rebound oh then the one-hand pass even anyone who does the oneand pass in this league it's a turnover hard nearly had it stolen away back out to Turner for three and he bottoms that it's just having awareness of where Defenders are the one-handed pass but just seeing Defenders Hal Burton is there in great position it's just a matter of the Warriors being unable to hit shots I mean right now they're playing the right way way they're playing hard they're moving the ball these are combos that have never been together so they're not surprised about this but to be three of 16 on threes and 12 of 38 from the field it at some point for the belief system to kick in they just got to see the ball go in the basket yeah and Pacers are going let's just slowly get separation keep inching away from them it was 2724 at the end of w the Warriors have eight points in the quarter Pat Spencer did have really good minutes though P's got nine as he sits shot clock at four Schroder on the kick out Moody on a relocate three and Trayce Jackson-Davis again another opportunity Warriors continue to rebound the ball but can they make a basket well that's the thing they make a basket part they've only got three Second Chance points and they got way more offensive rebounds in that they have nine offensive rebounds and then yeah to not convert those just keep your fight going and like you said though we've not said hey that that's an awkward shot or something they're taking good shots Great Looks just ones that you have to put in once in a while shot clock at three I moody right there he's going to make that seven out of 10 times and just banked it out and you're okay with that look mes stay with mathin Myles Turner another deep three different result Kyle Anderson the rebound tell you single digits at halftime is a win I was about to say this closing stretch going into halftime can you find some momentum some Rhythm Lindy Waters floating one up and out and it's an offensive foul Nembhard his defense you said it cuz he missed most of November and they struggled so much defensively without him coming back in December now they're kind of finding their defensively and a lot of it is him off the ball too he's hounded Steph into some of his worst shooting nights stepson Street Clos I thought it was unfortunate nart was still guarding him earlier in the game Haliburton will pick up a foul and head to the line Haliburton I love his game you know he's uh his I think his cousin is Eddie Jones right yeah his cousin is Eddie Jones and he didn't really ever meet him growing up but he said the only way it affected him is like well Eddie Jones is my blood that means I can make it I can make it to the league I can do what he did Eddie Jones out of Temple with Philadelphia was Andre gala's vet when he was with the Sixers oh there you go one of them anyway Warriors need some points and they need him in a hurry here still stuck on that eight Point quarter after 24 in the first and they're down to 30% shooting Lindy Waters laying that in that's a nice find from Kyle Anderson as well done cutting MH har in out up and short Trayce with the rebound Trayce Jackson-Davis with eight boards can you have a few solid possessions going into halftime here Trayce running the floor a on Obi Toppin and kind of f it away and Flo it in ky's so good at that always under control with his pace and again not letting Defenders off the hook ball movement creates long Closeouts you can attack those long Closeouts slers have nobody in double figures nart there he kind of acted his way out of a foul got a little momentum here can you keep the momentum oh car is all up in you this his face yeah fi R Ransom we had Carlile out on the floor that's his exercised as he's been look had a technical foul he wanted a foul on their last Drive Pacers have shot nine free throws the Warriors have shot six Ed Malloy is a finals level crew chief by large game's been fine see if the Warriors can take advantage of their frustration but Nembhard attacked pretty hard Wy Waters is on them there's a little contact back there no that's not a foul that's not a defensive foul at that's not a foul you got to if the defender is able to hold their line and that that's where you see R carlle an easy Ransom face Schroder ring that home hey momentum and so back to single digits sitting there at seven right now coming upon the final two minutes of the half Haliburton ah nice lob and Obi Toppin finishing they do a great job of cutting off those drives and Obi Toppin Defender was so focused on Haliburton tough to not be now you don't mind 228 points in the paint you want to see the Warriors hit some layups and some threes and that one just rimmed out I think switching baskets is going to be fun at halftime what's going on with that other basket aine missing well Kyle Anderson made him Miss I mean there is no you know crowd intensity right now they're just kind of seeing the Pacers around here another lob and Schroder broke it up I fooled him Haliburton got too casual to Warriors save it no he baited him into that pass and Moody oh had that three partially blocked got to get back now got to watch top and deep Here Comes Haliburton again and he'll go right to the rim he's like I'm not passing this one no one's bait me into passing this one so the final minute here warriors were down three at the end of one had an offensive power outage in the second quarter shooting 33% for the game but just hanging around with kind of effort look at Trayce directing traffic here skip pass and there's a three that goes down big your Moses keep shooting they want single digits at halftime single digit lead deficit he's got seven Off the Bench Haliburton that's a good contest by Lindy Waters and the Warriors not going to go two for one I don't think here no about a 7-second difference shooter though does go quick shot okay so it's a six-point game do you have one stop and 20 seconds of Defense coaches yelling no fouls Warriors do not have one to give here nart had it knocked away 5 Seconds to work with Kyle Anderson to a trailer and then you're going to have the foul as Trayce tried to send that down hopefully Trayce is okay was a big Collision in Fall Ben Mathurin sprinted back he was not going to give him anything easy but you love this ball pressure moving your feet shrewder Kyle Anderson comes up with it great pass to the running big you got to reward him now I'm telling you that that could be reviewed head and neck area got hit on the head I mean he he wound up but he hit him on the side of the head I think if they even looked at that Coach Kerr's asking for it but he's not going to get it guess they going to say that's incidental I I'm surprised they didn't even look at it though I'm kind of not surprised cuz with with the Warriors they they've done this in the past definitely got him in the head I mean I I think the fact that he was just going for the ball and it was that's not in the R I know it's not the rule but that's how they call it like he definitely got him in the head but it was a good contest and his head was just in the way that's how they've called it in the past they have that rule to head in the way that's how they am I wrong or right you seen it happen I know what you're talking about but I think Ed Malloy is going to want to relook at that it's a 13 to4 Warrior Run to end the half and as you hit the break the dubs are in the game in a five-point game Bonte Molly infestus Glenn is going to hit me in the head as we head to halftime for Jack in the Box live I've been waiting to do it for exceptional offers and halftime in Indiana with the Pacers leading by five and we talked about okay four 12-minute games now the Warriors lost one of those 12-minute games by three one of them by two but they're only shooting 36% and yet they're in the game and this goes back to Steve Kerr's press conference when the Warriors lost at home the fight the spirit the battling they're not doing well statistically other than they're battling to hang in the game they're competing at a super high level it's pretty impressive only down five one of the things you're seeing that's available though is the cutting like the the middle is open you're seeing why the Pacers are are ranked 21st overall defensively and offensive rebounds are available for you you got the nine offensive rebounds yeah you haven't converted them but you might as well keep doing those two things and see if you can stay in the game for longer I mean you're halfway there and you're here down only five Kena mentioned the cutting and The Bookies big time by focals brought to you by your Bay are Chevy dealers there was some good halfcourt offense and running the floor you can see why the Pacers struggle at times they're just kind of ball watching and look at Haliburton right here just kind of loses side of his man just for Split Second Gui SOS is like oh this is great news I can just kind of walk in here that's not even a speed cut and it worked out perfectly easy bucket there and then you're just going to run the floor if your Pat Spencer n hard was on him he just peels off of him for some reason I don't know where he's going but Lindy Waters is like oh this is more great news I can just look at Pat Spencer running the floor he's going to get an easy dunk and the Pacers are kind of shrugging going like oh how does that happen guys how you get another cut look at this top block from Haliburton he doesn't want Lindy Waters to come off here and get a three and Lindy Waters is going to kind of set him up go up then go back door and just get another easy bucket Nembhard tried to get over but he's late so these opportunities are there sometimes the Pacers defensively they're getting a little loose if you came alive from the three-point line at all you you would be in this game buddy Hield is one of seven you're looking at Lindy Waters 104 Moses Moody 10 of5 and so can you find any kind of perimeter shooting you know Dennis Schroder is going to be more aggressive only five points for him and Haliburton setting up Turner who's fouled to begin the second half Tyrese Haliburton was the best player on the floor he had 14 points and four assists well he's going to get into the teeth of the defense sometimes all the way to the rim and pass it late and make it easy on his big man and Turner so great at just rolling reacting to drivve he's got such great hands good touch around the rim that's short missed the free throw there didn't get his knees bent enough but to have any kind of upset you come in as a double digit Underdog it's like okay first quarter second oh wait a minute now you're into the third you start start to believe a little bit Myles Turner one of two from the line and again you have to feel like the Warriors have another gear they can get to the way this game is gone shooter look for Trayce on the roll wor that two travels on some show and goes here slow-mo needed an explanation FY Ransom actually slowed down and showed him with his footwork but again that was a right idea that was a super long close out the Warriors are creating these long Closeouts they just haven't taken advantage of them as much as they would like to Nembhard with Tyrese Haliburton Ben mathin Turner nart unable to finish there Pascal Siakam who's very efficient four of six but didn't look to take over that first half and Lindy Waters didn't give up a Blow by but he's got nowhere to go there that that was a turnover waiting to happen but that's ball pressure from Myles Turner he got so big couldn't really see anything else neyar passed up a lay up and warriors will take that as Siakam missed the three sometimes people get so three Centric as buddy Hield bottoms a three and that opened up because Trayce Jackson-Davis ran the floor and the last Defender there had to go with him he was such a threat you give Buddy Hield who was always going to run an open look aine working on Lindy Waters and reversing it up an in just tuning in Wars do not have Steph Curry Draymond Green Wiggins Randon Podziemski Harry pton the second Helena's not playing in this game we have only 10 healthy bodies they played nine Lindy Waters missing that three Al Turner from the foul line skill for a big guy to shoot it like he does Haliburton makes his decision so quick they kind of kept him on the sideline and actually worked to the Pacers Advantage with Turner being able to pop it's tough to help and recover for the Big H Lindy Waters ran over maing so Lindy called for the foul there it was maen kind of taking his Nembhard Playbook there just staying with the shooter the whole time and there was a little embellishment that's what Waters is boning the Warriors leading score in the game is Pat Spencer's career high nine by the way you're wondering in terms of finding points somewhere Myles Turner's got buddy on a switch Wheels around him couldn't finish but tipped up and in by zakum he's got a fine bodies get aggressive when it comes to boxing out Crack someone see offensive droughts here that when you don't have Steph and backed away again it's just still be Warrior ball again it's just a little thing the Pacers are not a good offensive rebounding team 29th there it's just the fundamentals sh clock at seven Grayson shooter two-man game Nembhard blows that up shot clock at one and War just didn't get a shot off there bud he was denied right with three to shoot and just threw it away well the Pacers did a pretty good job staying with shrewder first he was running off his screens they had everything under control and Buddy Hill could not find an opening at the end got to withstand these first couple minutes because you know Rick Carlile definitely went nuts at halftime they've come out pretty strong already forced the four turnovers out step through he pushed off it's going to be an offensive foul or will take it it's interesting they haven't even really gotten Siakam involved a ton here to start Mathurin trying to be aggressive Myles Turner's gotten in on the ACT that's it's an offensive foul you can see buddy he calling for it yeah when the arm gets extended it's a pretty easy call can you have a great possession here steady to ship Kyle Anderson on Siakam always a good defender in his own right squid action Sher attacking them hard with the left hand what a finish that's on a good Defender yeah split action and flow into a ball screen let that be your secondary action cuz shooter is so good with his speed off of that just cross pass give him an angle Siakam hold up top Haliburton always attacking for himself and to deliver to Siakam inside Siakam did a great job of not overrunning the pocket made sure he gave Haliburton a place to pass it to a good passing Lane buddy for three off iron there and Mathurin Rebound in motion imard lob and the early seal and zakum was fouled they called it on truder he's the small Defender again Siakam like I haven't really done too much here as soon as I see an opportunity I'm taking it smaller defender on him transition he got down there made sure he got to the free throw line Sher with four fouls but you don't have Steph it's on the floor so you might have a lot more Pat Spencer time Haliburton to an open Siakam for three Warriors fortunate there I mean Indiana is not making threes in their own right they're three they're three of 16 the Warriors are five of 22 make that five of 23 but Gui Santos the rebound tried to screen mat got rocked there in front of the warrior bench out of bounds that will be Warrior ball you just need a a more threatening drive with Myles Turner on shooter there try to make the defense react a little more get them off people only five to shoot here Looney knew about the shot clock and knocked out of bounds it's 2.1 now to shoot now you need even more of a quick hitter what do you have in your playbook 2.1 elevator door screen play coming right here buddy Hield to beat the buzzer grab it Siakam with a rebound telling you he he should have thrown another trash ball at your face to to get his rhythm going in this game as well bud he's two of 10 tonight last time what Ken is talking about is he he had the paper as Siakam dunks that down and Buddy wanted me to make a basket and he threw it in the basket that was his good shooting did not do that pregame tonight I think it was just more he had an urge to throw a trash ball at your face and then you realize well if I show him a basket he's not going to be able to resist that the Pacers have momentum effective eco-friendly pest control that's where the Colts

impact all the youth of America and what they're going to go on and be in life I mean basically probably the most critical job we have yeah let see if Schroder can get a little more aggressive he has the seven points he's your leading score that's available tonight foul as Gui Santos was going to pass through there was hell but Nembhard is on him and he is bringing the pressure what what's that like to put defense ens effort like Nembhard does every game he plays well it's tough to go against it's just annoying when a guy's in your jersey that's the thing he he trusts his quickness and he can move his feet laterally and he's going to get physical with you at times he doesn't really make mistakes so you're really having to make really good solid moves sometimes counter moves if you're going to get an opening Schroder an opening the Warriors just cannot throw it in one of the Great Lakes here in the Midwest there are no lakes in Indianapolis but get my idea cuz we're going to be flying to Toronto tomorrow five of 25 on threes Myles Turner missing there sh tried to move without the ball in that last Miss like that's what you have to do too against these great Defenders work without the ball scer mid-range okay that's the difference I mean maybe it's just not threes tonight Siakam leaking out after the made baskets he just runs the floor and he gets down there and the only guy down there is a smaller Defender but Schroder did the right thing that last time going counter move just attack off the dribble and he had Mathurin on him instead of Nembhard so Siakam 16 and Haliburton 14 Warriors still looking for a double figure score in the game Lindy Waters that's a nice take and finish he'll get the opportunity to add the free throw but Lindy Waters got off the three-point line there and went inside I said it during the open guys have to go back to their High School mentality like when they were the best player on the floor and just go hey I have to be aggressive I have to show I can score when I'm needed and don't miss your opportunity Lindy wers is maybe looking for someone to pass it to he goes count on move back to the middle and then don't shy away from any contact in this game as he misses the free throw Warriors seven of 10 from the line so siakam's got ind's last eight points but they go back to him here Warriors in his Zone oh Zone look out yeah they're going to try to switch it up take him out of rhythm just trying to keep contact anything you can do to do that a 212 and Mark shot clock at three Myles Turner for three The Zone work except zakum got the rebound and he draws the foul well that's the problem sometimes when you're in a Zone you don't have bodies on bodies and it's tough to find who you're supposed to box out because there's no one in your area if there's no one in your area you got to go find someone else in someone else's area Siakam just kind of slipped in there but this is actually a really good three-point shooting team they're eighth when it comes to three-point shooting percentage 3 for 17 is not normal Siakam missing the free throw the Allstar voting is live if you vote today your vote counts triple so you can scan the QR code at warriors.com vote uh Mr Curry would be a nice selection particularly at Chase Center the votes count as triple Steph Curry hits triples he's got a triple in his number the ballots are 30% off oh wait sorry that was wrong PR but it's triple the voting for Allstar did he miss both he did Schroder that was well contested Myles Turner shooting over him is something else that'll be Indiana ball out of bounds Looney was trying to get extra possessions he's always going to be in there fighting but this is why the Warriors spring The Zone on him like the team that's three for 17 right now from three-point range see if they can beat you over the top and also too because Siakam was getting one-on-one post-ups and were scoring and things like that you played last night the guys that did play are going to be worn down a little bit you only have 10 healthy bodies you haven't played post so only nine guys have played 131 back in it Mathurin in three can you rebound that and so Turner just whack it back out to Haliburton aan side step and Gui contested that another opportunity for Toppin but a foul on the rebound again that's the problem with the Zone it's so hard to find someone to box out and the first one Myles Turner is just the biggest human out there and he knows it and especially if Looney's not on him at the time he's just going to make himself tough to box out and Schroder is going to come out of the game now who's handling the ball you're going to have to have Pat Spencer bring it up Moses Moody bring it up Handle by committee if you can get a stop first and finish with a rebound four Warrior team fouls Indiana's committed two Turner with a show and go will be top and doing the same back to Turner and he'll put it up and out but draw the foul warriors were having to make multiple efforts and the Pacers were Relentless with their ball movement Turner turned one down then Obi Toppin turned one down and you get Turner inside it's just so much to defend that's really solid patient offense from the Pacers just in Myles Turner we talk about everything with him in terms of three-point shooting and shot blocking it's an year 10 but he's only 28 years old yeah he's still got he's still got some time to have a huge impact in this league but he's had a great career so far he just stays within himself he's low maintenance too super low maintenance as a big that's what's the kind of big you need in today's game it's kind of dominated by guards where do the Warriors find some offense down 10 right now shooting at 37% for the game five of 25 on threes buddy Hield will never be more open and those are the ones you get a knock down and he railed in he set him up perfectly started in the paint finally got the down screen his Defender just died on that screen TJ McConnell right to the rim mat Spencer trying to beat TJ McConnell went right back Looney keeping it alive but then Sheppard with Looney tied him up they got him Looney does not give up on the play first of all Pat Spencer went Podziemski deceleration off the one foot pump fake that almost worked but look at Looney inside like I see an opportunity Ben Sheppard didn't know what hit him now how do you win this jump ball that extra effort for Kaman he just never take it for granted and Looney's got Santos and Buddy hee if he wants it try kind of he guided that but Toppin got it Haliburton leaking out will lay it up and in that's unfortunate Kevon had won that tap but Toppin anticipated Spencer down the lane again to lay it up and in his first double figure scoring night of his career those high ball screens are really effective almost at half court it's so much more real estate for mile Turner to have to cover Pat Spencer from lacrosse to the NBA off yeah Haliburton shoved off because Gui Santos moved his feet Rick Carlile wants to pull his hair out he doesn't have any hair to pull out but that's frustration Gui Santos though man how do you deal with Gui Santos tenacious defensively moving his feet the war are doing a lot of good things in this game now shooting is not one of them but they're in the game they're here there's three inace with the deflection the outlet okay oh it's going to be a turnover no buddy Hield says it's not and then Lindy rocks into a three so good you got to be kidding me this is amazing Outlet pass but an even better rund down from Buddy hee the presence of mind to throw it back to Lindy Waters who stays ready look at try like hey I do it out there for you I appreciate you going and getting it any kind of three-point shooting or any kind of offensive burst be huge because the Warriors effort level has so good tonight just not being rewarded in making shots it's not surprising they haven't been a great three-point shooting Team all year or shooting team as Pat Spencer went off his leg he tried to Sprint his way to the rim didn't work out say the Topp and knocked it off Pat's leg so TJ McConnell playing with Haliburton here McConnell wants to go attacks the rim nicely as does Haliburton turnning the corner and floating it up and in man is he skilled six of eight shooting that was not easy we've seen him struggle against the Warriors before he's going not this game now Burton involved in that on sabonis trade the trade to really help both teams Sacramento and Indie that was blocked but it becomes a pass to Looney Looney is so smart he's like my guy has gone up to contest this buddy Hield shot the shot blocker is not inside side I can go ahead and snatch this this rebound off the block and score one easyone Looney ran a really nice route after that too but this is Looney just understanding hey I know what's happening it's going to be a block shot I'm going to grab it you have the NFL playoffs on your mind already Yes Warriors are over the limit so well this guy is tough to catch Haliburton now post is going to check in with 245 left in the third now in Santa Cruz he's coming off the 30o game he's been playing well he's finding himself he actually grew up watching Dirk nnsky and enjoyed watching agile bigs that can shoot it he definitely can shoot he shot 43% over his last two seasons at Boston College three and D big I was going to be a smart guy and say it's s feet yeah he grew up all right yeah you finished with watching and then added a few more things he grew 52 pick in the draft post e Santos catch and shoot three Gui Santos dropping it in G's three of four shooting he's got nine and the Warriors just won't go away keeping contact five-point game at Halftime not shooting the ball well yet they're hanging around Ben Sheppard bottoming that three Bryant had sprung fre and Moses Moody had to get in in there and help made it tough to get back out there it is that is post game off back iron there and Sheppard good rebound and McConnell pushing ahead Haliburton for three man tyr's Haliburton he is putting on a show right now seven of nine 23 points seven assists that's the reason that Indiana's 11 and three their last 14 buddy Hield barely ticked iron there Here Comes Haliburton again that's a tough contested one Haliburton threw it away Bryan couldn't get his head around e Santos to Buddy perfectly done he's keeping contact trying deflected and post comes up with it can you finish this quarter strong going into the fourth now never miss a chance to screen buddy right to the rim it looked like he was going to come back off with post great screen reject the screen you know the help is not there you're home free Haliburton is having an amazing game he's trying to put the Warriors away except the Warriors won't go away Indie takes time at a 10-point game get big savings on gig speed now through January 16th visit xfinity.com SL gig savings to learn more and that's where I'm taking Kena right after the game no you're not we are ice skating I'll pass we're staying in Indiana tonight don't want to break my face look I'll hold your hand and the two of us will just skate around you'll be fine it's a hard pass now final minute of the third quarter McConnell with Bryant that high screen Catherine now McConnell shot clock at three getting to that sleet spot for the mid-range and kicked iron short can you go two for one here B got be careful McConnell's behind him and that will get a foul just run into someone and Sheppard is trying to move his feet I do like Ben sheeper by the way he's pretty solid good shooter but Pat Spencer he tough to deal with can't hold your line go ahead and break the paint and see what you have you have free throws I do think as the Warriors go on here into the fourth quarter the middle is open your drives are open if if you celebrate screen don't miss a chance of screen you can go back screens and get back to cutting still we say it a lot and we do it for people that aren't familiar with Pat Spencer but when you win the tarton award which is the lacrosse Heisman Trophy and then you decide in your fifth year I'm going to go to Northwestern and play one year of college basketball and you end up making the NBA you got to be kidding me well you're a legit multisport athlete and by the way I think NBA players probably are the most talented guys when it comes to multiports I could be wrong about that but Pat Spencer's got 13 and Buddy heels got 14 of the two leading scores Mathurin lasering that in he's got 11 multiple scores you were down three at the end of one you're down five at halftime trailing by 10 right now but it's not been a blowout you've been in the game you're missing all of your offense and six of your top eight players shot clock at five Pat Spencer off iron there and Bryant with the rebound Mathurin from midcourt and that will do it so we talked about four 12-minute games Indiana won the first quarter by three the second quarter by two and the third quarter by five and they'll take the 10-point lead heading into the four Toyota game summary through three in Indianapolis pretty intriguing each of these little 12-minute games have been competitive the Pacers it's their starters leading the way the warrior bench is has the advantage 3117 and that's a limited bench I told you they struggle Off the Bench especially when it comes to their defense Off the Bench their opponent field goal percentage but Haliburton 23 Siakam 16 and Mathurin 11 have been the difference Quon pulse with the left hand and couldn't quite bank that home or is aching for some of these around the rim buckets to fall and Ryan is fighting with Gui Santos inside he's saying that's a tough match up for Gui Santos so he got extremely big so you've got Schroder and Moses Moody post with Gui Santos and Lindy Waters that is not something you would think in game 38 the Warriors would be playing but they're down six of their top eight players tonight need someone to get hot in this quarter Mathurin the shot clock at seven they try to get it to Siakam to fle it away shot clock down to four Mathurin lot of talent and the pump fake and then Lindy Waters came back for that rebound that was nice well done just make him take a tough shot too which guy in blue can provide some points in the fourth Moody having that knocked away Brian with a good Block it's one where you want to jump into the shot blocker go with something else then Sheppard nice spin move and couldn't pay it off with the basket post kept it alive and knocked it away and you're getting stops to start the quarter Schroder three got it so Dennis Schroder first made three he's got 12 we could this be a clutch game could they get it to five inside five minutes they're going to try mconnell short again the shooter moving his feet made it tough on him how much in the tank do dennish Rudder have set play last night set some screens here they've shown they'll die on some screens pick and fade and PO with the three and the warrior bench goes nuts but it started with his screen he's set an amazing screen Steph Curry's like this is amazing and he went behind the back on the pass oh yeah Thomas Bryant and he hits a three big men launching that's an answer no one could get back to his pop that may be something you could go to here post Schroder pick and pop he can stretch the floor Schroder off iron there I think Ryan will take that kind of let him off the hook Siakam from deep and Indie and let I mention it the eighth best three-point shooting team they had been cold most of the game but now bottoming a couple triples and back up to 10 Steve cerr is going to use a timeout with 927 left just trying to stay in contact with the Pacers no staff no Gary Payton II no Draymond no Kuminga no Wiggins no Podziemski And yet on the back end of a back to back look at the dubs the 5c pick in the draft get hit a three and the improbable game in Indie with the Pacers up 10 boom it's going to be fun having the All-Star game at Chase it does bring up the history at the Cal Palace and also Oracle y I think here you got to make sure you think about your shot selection if you have an advantage don't give it up you have a mismatch drive it if it's a slow or big if you can Siakam turn Schroder away shot clock at three buddy's got a launch over McConnell and he got it buddy buddy is hit a three and here come the Warriors again massive they're competitive they're going to compete for sure and the way Siakam and Halton have played this score is a stunner lost it out of bounds let say the Warriors touched it last Santos is definitely fighting Siakam Kyle Anderson hustling you think about the lineup the Warriors have right now Gui Santos is probably the best option to put on Siakam he's doing all he can to just make it tough on him now you got Kyle Kyle Anderson Gui 23 minutes last night 22 minutes tonight and the Warriors come up with a stop again Lindy Waters didn't give up on it even though he was beat Trayce Jackson-Davis up top and in the bucket he went up strong that time with two hands he knew he was going to get hit two hands finish through contact we're at a halftime margin of five I haven't been able to say finish through contact much this season McConnell to a cutter that was nice B bu he lost him there for a second I told you they cut off the drive so well but the Warriers can do get a drive in there cut see if they can stay with you pick and roll again with Trayce diving shot clock at 11 Warriors have nothing going right now Schroder going to call his own number and then threw it away and Siakam those long strides to the rim that was an unfortunate sequence there everybody just stayed home after the on ball Defender did a pretty good job on shooter see Indiana trying to put this one away right now they've up their intensity level defensively you can feel it sh clock at seven buddy Hield on Sheppard buddy trying to create space at three buddy turn fade fire and rimit out their offense really isn't creating anything right now it's just one-on-one having to create for yourselves mconnell and that's a big basket he faded hit that over Trayce off the window TJ McConnell's got 10 on four of eight shooting Trayce Jackson-Davis he was looking to pass it initially he just wasn't mentally prepared to power up oh that one off the backboard it was deflected look at buddy hee running sitting there at 11 right now but you're desperate need of a couple points just to kind of have that belief let go pick and roll the Schroder that's banged off the backboard that's not a goalen and it'll be a dunk by Siakam so a potential layup Bec the duck on the other end and Indiana moves it out to 13 it had been five just a minute and a half ago eight unanswered ultimate performer is Pat Spencer tonight with a career best 13 and without Steph Curry and backing up Schroder I think Spencer's been a big part of why the Warriors been competitive for most of the night has been amazing use that ball screen there shot selection has been pretty good running the floor never missing his opportunities and I talked about how competitive these guys are I was I was walking with him to the plane a few games ago and I was like man that moment you had with your brother cam was amazing he's like yeah that was awesome but I want to win man I'm so focused on winning I'm like I feel you brother he like I never like my brother I wanted to beat him at everything don't do that don't put words in his mouth he'll start a family feud he loves his brother but man he's so focused on trying to help his team win any chance he gets Kyle Anderson with Siakam on him Indiana's defense has become stingy here Buddy Hield missing that three and mat with the rebound Indiana's won 11 of their last 14 they won four in a row and the Warriors I mean half the Warriors have given them all they would want tonight the Warriors have been so competitive but when it comes down to it you just haven't shot the ball well enough sub 40% from the field sub 30% from three-point range shot clock at three around and out Lindy Waters what a rebound Katherine couldn't get that to go down or is it going to fight all the way through the final buzzer Kyle Anderson rocks into a hook and Bs it home that's footwork slow motion get into the paint take your time oh you got your pivot game you can work with use it ky's got six points seven rebounds four assists in 22 minutes Haliburton he justes that good 25 for Haliburton on eight of 10 shooting this will be the second and final time the Warriors see the Pacers Indiana's never lost a Chase Center they come one in San Francisco and trying to defend their home Cordon Kyle to Pat Spencer for 15 the cuts are there they'll just fall asleep start ball watching and that is lacrosse by the way moving without the ball and all the things that Pat Spencer does naturally as an athlete skip pass for Turner and he bottoms a three well they gave Bryan an extended run and now Myles Turner is in to finish it this is a five-point game two and a half minutes ago and credit Indiana for hitting the gas at the right time slowmo slowmo he's got eight that game he's Herky jerky you see the little hesitation to stop and go at froak Warriors will have two days off and then play the Raptors finish off the road trip Wednesday in Minnesota seeum dribbled that into trouble got it back though now Mathurin holding shot clock at five Mathurin on the kick out mat Spencer closed out Turner had to lean in and shot it long and strong and Lindy Waters is boxed out it's been a lot of good things from a lot of players tonight 52% shooting though by Indiana and P Spencer's got 17 I love that shot for him it was Gui Santos in Detroit It's Pat Spencer tonight well just get to the block get into the defender's body and fade away after the big man runs I can hear coach cerry yelling to to Trayce get in there get inside final four minutes here mhart Trey sent him away initially he got up in the air and fouled him it's smart if the defender's still there and he's a big and you're inside multiple pump fakes they're going to go for one of so tough for those Rim protectors to stay down but you got a big man on you this is what I'm talking about you have the advantage go ahead and use your speed against Myles Turner then get tricky with it into the body fade away you can't block that Pat Spencer is seven of 11 17 points in only 16 minutes efficient I mean I mean my goodness efficient have an impact on the game he's also efficient and Lacrosse I was just doing your thing you just connecting the two lacrosse and Nembhard misses both free throws tell you hit two threes here there's still 350 left in this game there just plenty of time anything can happen this crowd is is kind of feeling it it's like an ominous feel here that's fencer again he wanted to foul he didn't get it tried to create contact didn't get any love and Mathurin hits the three that's unfortunate they had some timely buckets momentum Stoppers all Anderson will handle up top slow-mo down the lane and Myles Turner blocking that shot he blocked that one so easy even with slow Mo's 73 wingspan they're getting downhill and they're not afraid to attack inside especially slow-mo you know what a game like this does though everyone feels included in part of the team you know if you're Gui if you're Pat Spencer you're post I mean you you all feel part of it but Hield off iron there buddy he's had to launch a bunch tonight just hasn't had a shooting night at six of 19 show a little frustration there then Mathurin putting the Warriors to sleep people will see the final score but if you didn't watch the game we 45 minutes of competitive basketball it was an exciting game and the fight Steve cerr was talking about has been there all night that was trying to get that to Trayce and it just threw it off the Pacers Myles Turner he's so good at kind of showing letting them know that he's there and then kind of backing off and the help and recover it's kind of like what Draymond can do Kyle Anderson those are the shots that just haven't gone for the Warriors really a lot of the season and Trayce Jackson-Davis Kind of Walled off the rim protector just think of the the layups and free throws and war team has plays enough defense as Siakam gets inside but offensively his team's been challenged and it's been challenged for about the last six weeks and eventually it's going to show up against the team that's been rolling offensively lately Trayce Jackson-Davis nice finish there little fake handoff in Indiana averages 115 and you may hold them below their average you have no problem with how you play D for for most of the night back in him a back toback shooting 40% on the road you're not going to win a game against a quality team is Turner misses but Mathurin scks in well remember last year they're second in offensive efficiency I mean they're up there their offense was huming they're getting back to that level they've won four in a row looking ice skating pass and stream the names the games of the NBC Sports app hard brought to you by your northcal Toyota dealers that place look look the people look warm there you're not going to sell me on it I don't you can do it I can't you're a pro athlete I am okay I'll drag you around in that little chair I'll do that actually that looks fun but I actually was a pretty good skater just not ice skating cuz ice skating it's so much harder to stop I don't feel like twisting my feet up and all that stuff twist an ankle so the final minute 45 here Indiana 12 of 19 shooting in the fourth the war is not bad nine of 20 but the Pacer offense just got rolling down the stretch Pat Spencer to post and he got it okay so post is going to add to his career best so he passed up the pick and pop three and he's still going to get a chance to get three points on the board lose your combo maybe you weren't expecting to see as much we were expecting to see it this game though with guys down get quit and post scoring maybe a chance for a three-point play I mean think of the Warriors last two drafts where tra Jackson-Davis 57th pick post 52nd pick I mean that's kind of some value at the very end of the draft yes good amount of value and by the way that 52 pick also came with Lindy Waters essentially because Warriors traded it and then got it back Mike Dunley be doing work he spent 5 years here in Indiana he did player that was the trade that got the We Believe team going true Al Harrington Steven Jackson Ste Jackson shuna J kevish let's go yes good pull with Mike dley Troy Murphy at good years in Indiana e Santos continues to get it done he's awesome for what could have resulted in this game versus what did happen this was a great game I mean the Warriors players up and down the roster going to take something from this and credit Indiana they're going to win 12 games out of their last 15 and they're absolutely rolling that's a travel well for one Gui Santos played as well as he did last night you want to follow those games up string games together and he played well again tonight so the Raptors on Monday two days off as the Warriors will head north of the Border first look at Toronto coach Curr is still coaching him up Clinton post and Spencer shot clock at five bat's got to make something that that is is James Johnson in the game Pat Spencer off the three and Jarace Walker will drag it down and that will do it so the Indiana Pacers stay hot the Warriors coming with 10 healthy bodies in missing six of their top eight in the rotation they hung in the game really all game got to give them credit like there was an opportunity just come and have fun and play an NBA basketball game and ball out put some numbers up multiple guys did that they competed they stayed in the game as long as they could got to give the Pacers credit offensively they've been rolling lately played well enough to win this one Warriors hope to add some bodies for Monday in Toronto 10896 the final Warrior postgame live coming up right now yep get your passports out yeah win this basketball game with six players out but they gave a spirited effort and that one point in the fourth quarter had cut the Pacers lead to five but the Pacers will go on a 124 run to win their fifth straight game they're now 12 of four in their last 16 and the Warriors dropped a one of1 on this four game Road Trip and go back down to 5 and9 and 19 but we'll dive into it and highlight
