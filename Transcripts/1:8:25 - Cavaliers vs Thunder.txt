 championships are won today but I think there's a lot we can learn about ourselves I mean this what we play for for games like this playoff type atmospheres whoever hits first that's the key we got to go in there go out there and do that it's a test um we want feedback we want to see where we are against the best there's no other better tting going against another top team in the league and it's going to be a good test place they're a tough team they're a unique team so for us we got to be ready off to jump and I have no doubt we will the snowy shores of Lake eie set the scene for this much anticipated presentation of Cavaliers basketball on FanDuel Sports Network brought to you by Hyundai it's an epic East West showdown as the Cavaliers play host to the Oklahoma City Thunder this match up between two heavyweights features in one corner Jarrett Allen and the Cavaliers which have won 10 in a row to own not just the best record in the East but in the entire NBA in the other Corner representing the west and hailing from The Sooner State hartenstein and the Thunder have won 15 straight and comfortably sit a top their conference as well hi everyone John Michel and Brad dhy and what a beauty we have for you here this evening two talented lineups two glorious starts and two of the brightest stars in our game today and Donovan Mitchell and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander whose Spotlight are Toyota key to the game man we got a big one tonight John I mean we've got the two best teams in the NBA and and probably the two best shooting guards in all of the NBA going head-to-head both of these guys are elad at their positions and for for different reasons Donovan who used to be this explosive alltime score has now become this player that's empowering his teammates and creating this balanced offense that everyone is a part of oh yeah he can go get it when he needs to but he's also giving everyone else the opportunity to participate at a high level you go to the other end Shai Gilgeous-Alexander I'm telling you it's all downhill this is the most aggressive attacker of the front of the rim in all of the NBA he comes at you downhill all the time and tonight Donovan's going to need his a game to slow down that young man and it's just such an intriguing match up on so many levels the Unstoppable Force against the immovable object is the Cav's number one ranked offense will get a huge test against the Thunders number one ranked defense here the even yeah these are the two best teams in the NBA and tonight it's going to be a will a battle of Wheels I don't care what anyone says the guys the players can say we're just it's just another game it is not you want to know who the best is and at the end of the night we're going to know let's welcome in the third member of our broadcast team it is Serena Winters and Serena as usual Donovan Mitchell has his pulse on the on the on the arm I guess you could say of this Cavalier team well John look as much as we can feel all the attention Sur in this team and the players can certainly feel it too behind the scenes when you see Donovan Mitchell speak you can tell that one of the keys to this game is trying his best to treat it like any other game you're always confident you know you trust the work trust what we've done what we're going to continue to do trust your habits um so like I said the other day you go into every game expecting to win you know if you don't then you know what are you competing for it's going to be ultimate test for us but these are all about just like I said tests you know it's it's going to feel like a high intensity game it should be a high intensity game but ultimately it's just another test coming up to smoking hot teams on a historic Collision Course and we get it going in only moments as it's now about that time sit back crack open your favorite beverage and settle on in the NBA Spotlight shines brightly upon the city of Cleveland and it's next like a good neighbor State Farm is there the starting lineups and the tip off are straight ahead we've had this come up a few times this season like I remember like Golden State came in here when we were like 10-0 I think or 9 and 0 and they were like 8 and one and that one felt different and then I think obviously the one in Boston we were 15 and0 felt different and then B like so you have these a few times that come up but they're really just about like um kind of testing see where yourself is where you where you're at as a team um cuz at the end of the day your goals didn't change it's just keep getting better as this year goes on but these games definitely feel different you know what I mean and you can feel it inside this building history in the making the first game in NBA history will take place tonight between a team on a 15 game Run and a team on a 10 game run this is the first time the teams from different conferences have met this late in the season with winning percentages of 85% or better and you see all of the history a lot on the line here this evening the Cavaliers have a sparkling record of 31 and4 the Thunder 30 and 5 Brad you've been in locker rooms like this what's on your mind yeah you're you're thinking about just what Ty was talking about where are we at you know you've had the the the tests before against Golden State against Boston well you played those games they're behind you this is before you you have not played this team this season you've been watching this team out of the corner of your eye because they have been absolutely dominant just as dominant as you are and this is a collision course so who walks out of here tonight as King of the Hill that's important because as you march on you want to have your confidence as you leave this game speaking of dominance the Cavaliers inside this building here at Rocket mortgage Fieldhouse are 18 and one there you get a look at the Concourse the energy is coursing through this building come on inside for the player introductions number 10 scarl the other gu here from Louis the 45 SP Mitchell now we have the former Kansas state number 32 W the other Bo he from USC number four EV M the man in the middle he from Texas number 31 Jerry KY C fans to let them know everybody make some noise for Kenny Atkinson is the reigning two-time Eastern Conference coach of the month his Cavaliers open the season with 15 straight victories they've now won their last 10 and 14 of their last 15 as they're perched to top the Eastern Conference at 31 and 4 here are the Thunder starters the headliner is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander he ranks third in the league in scoring he was the runner up for the MVP award last season as he checks in averaging north of 31 points a night 39-year-old Mark deaugh was named the NBA coach of the year just a season ago his Club has been running red hot as well the Thunder ofana a franchise record 15 straight they sit at top the Western Conference at 30 and5 with that let's send things back down to Serena Winters hey John There Is No Lack for story lines in this game you mentioned it right first time in NBA history that a team on a 15 game win streak and a 10 game win streak are meeting in the regular season that means these two have combined to win 25 straight games and out of their 61 total wins 46 of them have been by double digits talk about the two hottest teams in the league now that doesn't mean either of these teams haven't had to come back from a deficit right 15 of those wins combined came when they were traing by double digits and both of these teams have absolutely perfect records in their opposing conferences but for one team that's going to come to an end here tonight it's just wild the starts for these two teams as you get a look at Donovan Mitchell there's hartenstein a big free agent sign during the off season he's become even bigger with the absence of Chad holen who's been out with a broken hip Stein become a conate center in this league the Cavaliers have not lost since December 8th the Thunder have not lost since December 1st as Serena detail the Thunder are unbeaten against the Eastern Conference the Cavs have yet to fall from a team from the West these clubs own the NBA's top two records something has to give here tonight Jarrett Allen and hartenstein step to the center circle the tip it one by the Cavaliers and we are underway John Michael Brad dhy and Serena Winters buck up as off we go here in Cleveland Darius Garland is watched by Gilgeous-Alexander he'll feed Allen off the Wade for a quarter three hey knocks it down right away just great ball movement something that's been continuous throughout the entirety of the season for the Cavaliers moving that basketball making this Oklahoma City defense which is tenacious move their feet and create gaps by moving the ball quicker than they can dribble it Shai Gilgeous-Alexander gets it into the pain as slower doesn't go it's rebound by Donovan Mitchell Mitchell has his head up Mitchell in toward Williams finds Garland in the corner he's got it back to back threes for the Cavaliers to open the show yeah nice quick Ball moving again by the Cavaliers two very efficient offensive possessions back to back Cavs are starting with a lot of strength on that offensive end Shai Gilgeous-Alexander gets fouled the foul is on the floor Brad this is a set play the Cavs win the tip the Cavs get into the offense and Dean Wade in the corner yeah this is a nice pick by Dean you see the roll right there Dean continues on throughout the lane Jarrett can shoot that basketball or deeds wide open for a nice pass from Jarrett good job our crew chief John Goble made the call he's joined by referee Ray a Costa and umpire Robert hussy Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league in drives as here's Mor Mor his shot doesn't go Hartenstein can't follow Mobley plucks the rebound out of the air and Out Come the Cavs with an early nothing lead Garland will orchestrate this offensive sequence he's guarded by the rugged perimeter Defender Lou George as Gilgeous-Alexander picks up his first foul foul number two Alexander Cavaliers did a great job recognizing the mismatch with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander getting stuck on Evan Evan goes right at him there a foul right there he cannot guard Evan Mobley and I like Evan's aggressiveness going right to that basket Allen hands off to Garland who comes and gets it back it goes to Wade Mitchell now Mitchell pulls up in and out here's Jalen Williams third year man out of Santa Clara he's averaging 21 points a game he backs up he's guarded by Jarrett Allen down the alley he goes he'll settle for a mid-range jumper that gets the thunder on the board Williams like many of these Thunder players love to drive as Garland sneaks his way inside glasses clean by hartenstein he'll take it himself lumbering into the four Court he finds Gilgeous-Alexander off to L dor for three Lor's long range game has really come around he shot a career high from three last season his fifth in the NBA he's been even better this year Allen from the elbow Wade upstairs he BS it in nice job good pass top to top and your comment about Dort is actually the right man he is a tenacious strong Defender but he is shooting that basketball much better this year gives him a lot of VI viability on the offense of him when he can make those shots Williams could not find hartenstein it goes to Wallace in the corner he'll tip toe Baseline give to dork dork can't shoot it back it goes to Williams touch foul is called on Wade here was Wade at the other end he makes a nice catch at the doorstep yeah you see Don return the corner over top to Jarrett Jarrett nice up top usually that's Evan Dean happened to be there great catch by Dean nice little spin on that basketball look just enough little English on that ball to kiss it off the glass nice job each of these teams has been off since Sunday that afternoon the Thunder top ranked defense held the Celtics to 92 points as Haren Stein's floater is good including just 27 points in the second half as the Thunder beat the Celtics 10592 the Celtics by quarter scor 35 30 15 and 12 they got smoked out of the building defensively Dort with the block on Mitchell Mitchell can't quite get it back comes into the hands of Wallace Wallace leads the break Williams lays it in he gives the Thunder the lead yeah their their defense has been just the best in the league I mean holding 16 of their opponents under 100 points that's over half their games and in today's league if you can't score 100 points you you're just in trouble and so they really good wall the basket as Williams with his shot that doesn't go only tried to squeeze between Wallace and Hartenstein he got knocked off the ball as Mitchell fires a three long rebound is back down eventually by Wallace there's Wallace again Wallace hero steps down the lane he missed the shot credit Garland who tracked him back step for step Darius did a great job staying in front of him he had nowhere to go and he left his feet Williams did that's why Wallace didn't he was in trouble Kenny ainson is in sense that the original foul wasn't called on Williams Williams eventually gets charged with the personal see Evan crosses him here and he gets hit right there that's a foul that's yeah I I don't know what yeah I think Kenny's argument is if that's going to be allowed there this is going to be a long night y but allowing it on both ends Allen straight away pestered by hartenstein Garland with six to shoot he'll step back that Ball's tipped and grabbed by Williams Gilgeous-Alexander SC over 31 a night eventually it's dord in the corner he stepped on the line and the ball goes over to the Cavaliers we take a look at our injury report brought to you by elk and El Sam Merrill remains out for the Cavs no to no Mitchell Chen hren out with a long-term injury to his pelvis Alice kuso has been out for a couple of weeks this is a Thunder team it is 15 straight and they still have Caruso and hopefully hren coming back before the playoffs Caruso for sure hren they're hopeful Garland touch pass to Allen and Allen gets fouled by hartenstein yeah teams are are very similar Cavaliers same thing with a coral coming back and you know and Merrill coming back there's a lot of Talent on both of these rosters nice pass two great passes good feed by Dean Wade nice pass by D Darius right into the palms of awaiting Jarrett Allen there's the mention Isaac Okoro he's a notable Omission from our elk and Elk injury report he is available here this evening as we pause for a word from alson Jewelers discover the Timeless Elegance of Alon Jewelers your destination for unparalleled selection and personalized service more than just jewelry it's an experience Max Strus and Caris LeVert are the first two Cavalier substitutions as they check in for Mo and M this has been the usual substitution pattern for Kenny Atkins in this season yeah they come in they bring that kinetic energy right away with Levert and spru you got guys going to defend hard and run the floor so you don't lose anything you actually gain some Pace when they're on the floor Wallace shuffles inside throughs find a teammate in the corner it's Williams good ball Movement by OKC similar to what the Cavs do make that ball move they don't dribble a lot a lot of passing Garland for three carers Garland this season ranks top 20 and three point percentage he's one for three to open this ball game Gilgeous-Alexander leads the league in drives that time he'll stop at the elbow that shot was wide right and well defended by Dean Wade Dean Wade's got size and he can move his feet Dean Wade can guard guards on the perimeter at 6869 he Gilgeous-Alexander 66 big guard but could not get around B screw stepped on the sideline it's caris Levert who opened him up as we have our first timeout we are underway here in Cleveland back inside rocket mortgage Fieldhouse we get a look at the live odds for tonight's game courtesy of FanDuel the play the thunder right now at minus 115 the Cavs at minus 111 the over under it's a 226 1/2 play over at- 118 under goes off at- 110 the Cavaliers open as threo favorites the 31 and four Cavaliers taking on the 30 and5 Thunder as Serena was back behind the Cavalier huddle at that last timeout yeah the two big things Kenny mentioned were look we've got to get every 5050 ball tonight we've got to up our physicality and then Donovan looked over at Jarrett and said hey keep setting those screams and we'll keep making things happen what a start Kenny ainson has had here in Northeast Ohio backto back Eastern Conference coach of the month as we are back underway Williams has seven quick points for the visiting Thunder draws a foul there Levert picks up the personal LeVert Garland truce Wade and Allen make up the Cavalier five may have heard our court miks pick up Kenny Atkinson say as long as you call it both ways yeah that's all you want you know it's going to be a little touchy fou here or there make sure it's consistent look have two game get two best teams in the league you don't want to separate it by po officiate way grabs a long rebound so here's Levert he'll stride into the four Court Levert sets up a three here's Levert checked in fifth in the NBA and three-point accuracy credit Dean Wade on the offensive glass that ball ends up out of bounds last off the Thunder Dean just being aggressive going to get that basketball fighting through three guys in those blue jerseys nice job by De keeping that possession alive for his teammates L plays through Allen goes to Allen my Jarrett Allen with a menacing finish car car lebert turns that corner draws that Defender Jarrett Allen steps in there like a windmill and tomahawks one down strong rebound by Dean Wade as he held Jalen Williams off and it goes to Allen again Jarrett Allen with backto back ferocious dunks has given the Cavaliers a 1412 lead being extremely aggressive and active on both ends of the floor Cavaliers love that when the big guy cuz they trust Jarrett to change the momentum to change the game and he does it Gil Alexander's first points as we have a foul on Cason Wallace we'll talk about it night in and night out this guy right here is the Difference Maker because of his defensive proudness but on the offensive end equally so so effective scoring that basketball any within 12 ft of that basket and a high clip highest in the league they're going to use him tonight and he his energy is contic through this basketball team Allen's third in the league in field goal percentage as Garland knes inside he Bing score nice job Darius Garland strong move to the basket good finish Aaron Wiggins has checked in along with the second Jalen Williams that we see here tonight for the Thunder this is the third year man out of Arkansas who has the ball he'll shovel off to Cason Wallace Wallace Nails a three Thunder have a number of capable three-point Shooters they're a lot like us John lot very similar basketball teams a lot of guys can make shots Thunder lead the league in points off turnovers and they pick up two there Cavaliers by the way are second in that department so two opportunistic defenses George neag is checked in he'll send one back to Strus Strus and corks a three that's true ni little two-man game between Jordan D and Max Max Strus George had nice little pump fake drove the defense was able to get back in front he makes a nice little kick out as streu's Defender was coming to help Kon Wallace with his dribble back it goes to Joe Jalen Williams once more to Joe Joe got decked by Strus and he'll shoot free throws a lot of times you run a play and and the the continuance of the play is what the actual result is that's what this is the play was designed for georan to shoot that quick three he had a an opening he drives to the basket the defense collaps and having such a high basketball IQ he recognizes that someone's open you take a look out of the corner of your eye you see Max Strus standing there wide open kicking that basketball smart basketball so here's Joe who has flourished in Oklahoma City over the last two seasons after being waved by the Sixers back in 2022 Joe's about the only player on this team Brad who will hunt threes most of the other Thunder perimeter players will look for the three to set up the drive which this team loves to do yeah he's very aggressive getting after shooting that basketball and so very streaky but he can get going he's a guy you have to pay attention to cuz it's going up and if you don't guard him he will hurt you thunder 21 Cavaliers 19 heang puts his head down shovel the moovly bobbles it and that of bounds and goes oh that's a nice pass for George that's good play a good attack Defender had Evan blocked off he couldn't see George's hand so the pass kind of came out of nowhere kind of close B jity will be at a premium tonight for the Cavaliers that's their fourth turn over as Jalen Williams line drives home a three that's Jalen spelled j a y Len there too many of them John I can't keep up also Kenrich Williams is going to come off the bench likely at some point in this game as Niang spots up Joe tracks it down Jo sends it ahead to Wiggins Wiggins going to half step on knee to the basket Mobley was there as Wiggins adjusts and lays it in Wiggins at 15 big points off the bench in that win over Boston on Sunday and just 20 minutes of play as Mobley lines up a three G just Alexander picks his head up he's watch by LeVert that's way long Mobley huls in the rebound gers Alexander has opened this game two for six SCU again nice shot by Max Strus that's what those are back breaking shots but that's his rhythm he catches you off guard as soon as he catches that basketball if he makes those shots it's absolutely devastating to you the morale of the defense because it's not set L tips the weak side rebound eventually picks it up those zigzag into the four Court his CS Trail by four L hands off the thru out under two and a half to go in the first Gilgeous alexand uses a Williams screen works now on Mobly tries to drive can't do it then he draws a foul that's an excellent defense by Evan Mobley wow Gilgeous-Alexander will shoot free throws when we come back and also when we come back we'll hear from this man Darius Garland on the importance of the SE Darius Garland going out at isn't anything new they've been competing against each other since high school Darius said he was looking forward to how fun tonight's match up would be but he also said it's welcome back to field it's cool to have um especially since we don't get the recognition that we get I know that's been a topic for like the last week or so so uh uh this moment today is going to be super cool just having two spawn Market teams and two teams in the top of the league going at it so it should be a fun battle yeah and he's exactly right it it should be a fun battle and yeah that that's the thing that this league is starting to become more aware of is that these small Market teams are very very good and the stars of this league lie within these small Market teams and we got to do a better job of making sure people know who they are instead of all these you know guys who've been stars on these massive in these massive cities but aren't relevant as far as winning and so uh he's right and and this is fun I I love watching Shai Gilgeous-Alexander play tremendous the talent as well as Darius SC go us Alexander no NBA first team reach of the last two seasons he was last year's MVP runner up play man some big man in Denver name yic as the Thunder lead is 2822 now 2824 as EV Mobley a mid-range jumper and Evans on the board nice little curl play where you curl right into the pocket right there that's a nice job right around that free throw line defense is not quite set got to be quick and Evan was Joe leaves his first three short Levert leaks out Mitchell thought about it Mitchell on the bounce Joe rebounds Jo's out here with Thor goas Alexander Wiggins and Williams Gilgeous-Alexander this time works on truths he loves the mid-range game yeah he's he's excellent in the mid-range game he'll create contact he'll come into you and then bounce away from you got to have your hands up move your feet be underneath him and be aggressive what a move by Mitchell as he'll find Mobly and Mobley gets bow first of all Mitchell was able to shed a plus defender in door then he wheeled right around Gilgeous-Alexander to set up the play yeah you see this play a lot with Mobley as well as Jarrett Allen and he's going to curl right around this nice screen Donovan set him nice screen Jarry a lot of times will roll to the basket with that thunderous dunk and Evan who continues to grow his game will stop a lot of time trun that free throw line and shoot that little jump shot get the Cavs core four on the allstar floor All-Star voting driven by KIA is live get your votes in for Donovan Darius Jarrett and this man Evan Mobley right now at vot Cavs Doom bble has already drawn three fouls here in this first quarter har Stein has re-entered Mobley splits the pair Thunder 30 Cavs 25 as we approach the final minute of the First Jus Alexander works on Levert keeps his dribble stops phades away from 15 poked by Niang and grabbed by Mobley good defense by Caris LeVert very aggressive with Alexander who's very aggressive with the basketball ironically L works on Gilgeous-Alexander and how about that pass to niang niang however could not lay it in nice pass by LeVert that was a great play George just wasn't quite expecting that pass Levert almost picked off the Jordan effort K just Alexander from the Cavalier logo he'll wait for a dork screen to the foul line he goes goes Alexander leans and misses Hartenstein with the offensive rebound he gets fouled foul is called on the floor it's on the Cavaliers knee Ang hartstein grab M's Jersey and pull him down getting that rebound and there's the foul watch this drive here gives a nice pump fake nobody fouls and arin's got a hold of Evans Jersey gives him a good pull down he s a healthy three-year free agency deal over the summer became a full-time starter last season with the Knicks after that injury to Mitchell Robinson and just made a major impact on the Knicks defense changed the complexion of that Knick's interior had a marked effect upon that team success I mean I think he's the most improved player in the league thus far he has been remarkable talking about Hartenstein and the the effort he he's given this basketball team on the offensive and defensively he's always been tough physical but he has played fantastic on the offensive he's a two-way threat you have to guard him and uh he's legit every night Leber is badgered by Aaron Wiggins halfway down the alley rebounded by Joe final seconds first quarter Gilgeous-Alexander with a leaning three 12 minutes complete from downtown Cleveland Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers Trail by seven the G were led by Jarrett Allen with a couple of dunks Max through with a couple of Threes as off we go East versus West the two top teams in action Cavalier Austin Carr and Austin what did you see after that exciting first quarter well it look like both teams are feeling each other out but the one thing for sure you can have too many negative possessions this is like a playoff game each possession counts yeah look we know that OKC is one of their biggest strengthes turning you over they did Force turnovers in that first quarter definely got to clean it up there right got to clean that up because if you take care of that you're going to get a lot of good open shots so you got to take care of the ball yeah one of the things I did notice the bigs do it did do a good job defensively OKC look they're known for those paint points right but just five of 13 in the paint there guys this is only the eighth time in this the 36th game of the season that the Cavs have trailed going into the second C have won five of those previous seven games as off we go here in quarter number two we'll set the lineups for you in just a moment as here's Williams he'll relay and find Dort here's Kenrich Williams the third Williams to appear for the Thunder as he'll launch a long two and hit Okoro is a welcome sight back on the floor for the Cavaliers he missed a number of weeks with a shoulder injury as the knee Yang shot doesn't go Mobley with a terrific rebound he holding the one arm board and keep the possession alive yeah it is good to see Isaac back on the court he's having tremendous start to the season before he hurt that shoulder so hopefully he can pick right back up shooting that basketball playing a tough defense unaccounted for it's his third three of this first half good ball mve again for the Cav Strus feeling that tonight's got that shot going so got to keep going through it Ma can be a dangerous man when he gets hot last season he had 10 games where he hit five or more threes that d triple wasn't close Kenrick Williams hits the deck SOA scce down ball very Hustle by Max Strus ball movement just par himount on both ends of the floor Donovan makes a nice pass to Isaac Isaac makees sure that ball gets to Max Mobley Muses through Hartenstein he puts it up an in and Evan Mobley has a chance for the three-point play just playing Big Boy ball down on that block Evan Mobley just not going anywhere he takes the hartstein and puts him in the basket which is difficult to do two a couple years ago in New York he could not do that tonight it's a different story Evan Mobley setting up shot down there where the big boys play stre been in constant motion also credit truce because he got that basketball quickly moved it into the corner and the Cavs got that ball down low to Mobley where Mobley could go to work one on one all about Pace no matter even if the other team is fast you still want to go at them hard to make sure whatever they're doing they're have to doing doing it at the top speed that's where you make mistakes arenstein he flow Bly played him step for step rebounded by ni now it's Mitchell Mitchell into the four Court took a BMP from Dort and Dort picks up the foul but tell you what Dort is an excellent Defender he can match Donovan strength for strength as well he stays in front of Donovan very well look at him move his feet that's a big guy 67 235 lbs you know and he he is he's going to give Donovan all he wants but I think the spider it's going to it's going toite him this physical defense that's being played on him be an elite three and D guy he always had the D but he's added the three recently as Mobley inside had it knocked away Strus rescues back it goes to Mitchell inside Mo's there Mobley pump faks and gets fouled well I love the fact that Donovan who had a shot went right back down stairs to the to the posted up Evan Mobley that is outstanding get those points in the paints we got to establish that territory instead of trying to outshoot them before Evans last basket you we we went 5 minutes and 16s seconds without a point in the paint so we got to change that we're too big of a team too good Bley hits his first as we pause for a word from Kia the Kia Santo xro and Turbo Hybrid John Michael Brad dhy and Serena Winters thanks so much for joining us here for this epic showdown East versus West to 30 win teams just 35 games in yeah two best teams in basketball two small markets not the most popular team so you don't hear about it enough but they're here tonight and uh you we got Doris Burke and and Mike Green we got all the big big names in the house good to see Williams cans at three he has 10 quick points Jalen Williams might be the best player that a lot of people have never heard of he was really good very talented young man shoots the ball defends extremely well does a loopa of everything very well very good Defender with his size as well so you're exactly right but he can shoot the lights out he's only in his third season he's averaging 21 points a game as there's Isaac Okoro Okoro knocked it away from hartenstein and then hartenstein fou him to pick up his second I'm sure that's when the big man would like to have back good play that ball comes parkstein gets a little bit casual with catching that basketball instead of grasping it two hands aggressively he's already turning and looking and that just goes Isaac Okoro right place right time that's good defensive mindset Ty Jerome is checked in he's on the carousel he'll dump off the Mobley and Mobley crushes it home Evan M's dominating that paint last three shots all within 6 feet of that basket he knows where he's supposed to be and that's where he set up shot Ty Jerome quickly making an impact as there was Isaac Okoro guarding Jalen Williams now Kenny ainson has that extra Defender at his disposal Mitchell knifed to the basket ran out of real estate rebounded by Wiggins Wiggins in Tor Mobly dumps back to Williams Williams back into Wiggins who Banks it in and Kenny Hinson wants a timeout remains here in the second quarter this has been the season of Evan Mobley Mobley once again inside flexes his muscles and throws it down and that matters you know stacking experiences at as a group figuring things out having to persevere through adversities falling down and having to get back up sticking with it all of those things uh can lead to breakthroughs and I think there's probably some of that going on um their players have grown they still have young players that um are still forming Mobley is the guy I have in mind there um but yeah there's no rules on on who can be a good team you know they've figured out a formula with this particular group of guys that's been very effective for them that's our rocket mortgage built for Success thought of the night Evan MO is the high man for the Cavs with 10 points Mark D would know he is a team that's similarly situated they've been around together for a couple of Seasons they're starting to work their way up in terms of postseason performances each of these teams was knocked out in the second round just a season too as meanwhile Ty Jerome bankson scores expectations continue to grow in both Oklahoma City and Cleveland yeah the only thing I I would I would disagree a little bit on is you do have tremendous players and these guys the ability to keep those players together and he talked about the the tenure which is important but it's also tenure players that are very very talented K Williams looks for an opening there was none but he'll find a teammate in Wallace however and Cason Wallace Banks and scores Wallace the second year man out of Kentucky was inserted into the rotation as a rookie a season to go as to Rome cuts and Street finds him tyone was such a smart basketball player he puts himself in position where his teammates can see him and gives them an outlet and that time it was an outlet leading to the basket great pass by Max Strus smart play by Ty Jerome Jerome accounts for six quick points on three straight possessions two buckets and an assist as Kenrich Williams Fades away he's the Elder Statesman of the bunch in his seventh season out of TCU once again it's Ty Jerome as Jerome with instant impact H Ro had the defender on his hip thought that was a foul looked like a foul from here but did a great job guy was hanging off of him Williams draws the foul you hear the reaction from this cavaliere crowd see this pick right here this little pick and roll you throw that thing up top to Jarrett but Hartenstein just totally goes right to Jarrett it leaves a wide open Ty jome on the back door cut Butz his man's head is looking at the B as well great basketball IQ so here is Williams here's the foul that neither Allan nor Okoro was thrilled about and there you see why yeah I mean you see why on the other end to Jerome had a guy hanging off of him as he shot the basketball and made the basket you know just one consistency Williams has selected 12th overall out of Santa Clara considered a late BL in college spent three seasons under herb send de with the Broncos to the West Coast Comas here's jerone he draws another foul boy he checks in and right away it's the Ty Jerome show very aggressive I like his aggressiveness you know he's looking to score that basketball and as that becomes what teams recognize OKC recognizes then he'll start being able to make passes and get his teammates freed up the Thunder are already over the the limit more good news that's the second on Williams Wallace and hartenstein also have been saddled with to you can secure your spot for next season's Cavs United memberships by placing

in the second quarter Garland barks it off to Allen that was a terrific feed as Allen got fouled and fou is on Wallace who picks up his third that pass may have looked easy it was not no it was not an easy pass and it was the correct pass cuz look how wide open that lane is so the either Defender did not make the appropriate adjustment to Jarrett cutting which is difficult because and I'll tell you why it's because Darius is such a great great ball handler and the guy guarding him and saying I cannot step away from him because he can handle it and shoot it so it puts so much pressure on the defense there you therefore drawing the foul nice job here on Sunday in the Cav steady 115 105 win over Charlotte Allen recorded his 20th double double of the season 19 points 11 rebounds he was nine of 10 from the field wow grabb five offensive rebounds blocked a couple of shots yeah he's every night I mean the guy just fantastic every night so consistent long distance three by Joe is no good Allen gobbles up that rebound and out Trot Okoro we approach the Midway point at the second give it to Ty Jerome why not Jerome lost it that time Wallace will feed Joe Wallace plays with three fouls here 605 to go in the second here is Wallace and he hits a three one thing that's been consistent with this Oklahoma City team is every time we've had a turnover they go make baskets they go make something happen so we got to be really cognizant we heard AC talking about that at the break got to do a better job taking care of that ball make sure we at least get a good shot Garland Dan it with that basketball all oops for Allen and Allen does the rest and that's a good shot great patience great Poise by the caval talk about those points off turnovers Oklahoma City scores over 22 a night is a big number a lot that's a lot of points that's in and out for Guild Alexander it's a four-point game it's been tight throughout if you're just joining us as Garland between the circles angles off an Allen Street those two have developed such a chemistry as he'll sling one off to Jerome back it goes to Dean Wade Wade salvages The Possession plays it to Okoro Allen with another offensive rebound gives to Garland Garland fires hey and knocks it down yeah give Jarrett Allen a ton of credit on that he kept that possession alive we talked about the chemistry between point guard and Center Garland and Allen and it's on display here at quarter number two is these teams punch and counter punch of the second quarter other in terms of talent so tightly contested hustle plays can so often make the difference as we take a look at our Alon jeers time to celebrate moment Jarrett Allen hits that offensive glass finds Garland in the corner as the Cavs just on the other side of the break from this thunder lead all the way down to one yeah the difference becomes the little things and at the end of the day the little things add up to possessions and this is a a possession oriented game you have to outp possession your opponent because that gives you opportunity for volume and today's game is so much about volume of shot when you make mistakes and you don't get get a shot the other team goes down and makes a shot you're almost two baskets behind so got to be careful got to be smart just Alexander ran out of options he had it knocked away Levert the other way gives the Cavaliers the lead great transition break opportunity Cav took advantage now that's the Cav doing what OKC does very well transition and and taking advantage of turnovers for Point yeah has it really picked it up in the shooting Department here in the second quarter an offensive rebound however by Joe keep possession for the Thunder the Cavs shot it at 41% in the first they're over 60% here in the second as Gilgeous-Alexander gets loose and dumps can't give them Second Chance opportunities they're very consistent at taking advantage of mistakes oh man by the opponent wow illegal screen is called on the Cavaliers Dean Wade these are the top two teams and creating points off turnovers the Cavs pick up a couple here yeah Jarrett Allen a disruptor in there good job by Darius getting that thing out front Caris Levert taking advantage of that turnover making it a bucket that's a two for one when you take advantage of a a turnover and get something out of it Donovan Mitchell back in the ball game interesting lineup here for the Cavs Gilgeous-Alexander finds dor dor gets run off the line by Mobley he'll give to hartstein who shot puts it up and in Cavs have both big men on the floor along with Donovan Mitchell der I Garland and caris Levert Thunder by three Mobley works on Williams uses all that range does Mobley he now has a dozen I like the fact that he took his time did it quickly but took his time was that very controlled explosiveness where he was going to get that shot it's just so long and difficult to contain and that's on Hartenstein that's his third credit Donovan Mitchell if he doesn't try to fight hard over that screen no foul is called now Mark danol has a decision to make as his starting center has just picked up his third well he came in and set a big screen on Donovan he really gave him a shot if he hadn't rolled if Hartenstein hadn't rolled away from that he may have gotten away with not getting the foul but when he's hitting like that he's almost moving and that one hurts as H Stein will head off to the Thunder bench he's replaced by one of the Jalen Williams so both Jalen Williams are on the floor Gilgeous-Alexander Joe and dork complete the Thunder five lt's open lbert fires Allen got hauled down I think that's on sh Gilgeous-Alexander it is and it's his second the Thunder have been over the limit for a handful of minutes here so Allen will return to the line that clearly is a restriction of movement foul on J he's got him by the back there and gives him a little tug and tries to get away from him but too a little too late Allen rattles in his first we're tied at 53 Jarrett Allen steady 10 points three rebounds he also has a team high four assists the Cavaliers here in this first half have dished out 17 assists on 19 field goals Sensational percentage as Gilgeous-Alexander wants to drive he'll stop fire and score yeah they they played well it's just they playing against a team that's just as good as they are so it's going to be the little things that separate how do you do that what does it look like I don't think there's going to be any huge runs in this game I think you just got to have consistency and Poise to have an opportunity LeVert gets picked up by Williams on the switch the shot clock shows five LeVert wants to go to work he'll throw on the brakes tough shot Allen with another offensive rebound it was knocked away though by dork here goes dork ring into the four court but he lost the ball great rebound by Jarrett Allen and good good play by OKC knocking that ball away without a foul so Mitchell he'll work on D had him leaning the wrong way Levert saves it gets it back to Mobley Mobley angles inside but he got called for a travel so the Cavs giv it back Kenny ainson looks on this is a Thunder team that does not have a lot of weaknesses however rebounding has been an issue where was the travel in there did you see a travel I think if you go off one leg you have to come down on two and vice versa as goes Alexander again got stripped here's Mitchell Mitchell has his head off dumps off to the trailer garland that was knocked Away by Joe Gilgeous-Alexander that was really good defensive posture by OKC getting in the way of that dribble darling on the bounce what a pass inside Donovan Mitchell dorks hot as L got called for the foul let's examine it here good pass look at that right through the middle think that it was a foul cu the ball went up if the ball went down oh yeah he got him on the hand used to always try to explain that to our officials when we played against the great Michael Jordan he would always slap at the ball Mitchell sinks is first as we remind you that Cavs basketball on FanDuel Sports network is brought to you by MGM Northfield Park featuring world class gaming dining racing and entertainment find your fun at MGM Northfield Park and by your Chevy Network dealers those are Mitchell's first two points of the first half under two to go under 57 C 56 we've seen Donovan do this before play the role of distributor do the little things in the first half before coming on in the scoring Department in half number two they're going to reverse the call this be Cavaliers basketball and credit Mitchell there as he was up at the point of attack defensively yeah really good defense by Doan being very aggressive on that back court making a a tough pass he was right there almost got to he almost got to steal P works on Joe gets inside finds Mobley Mobley for three Allen's underneath and he lays it in nice job by Jarrett Allen cleaning that up Evan got hit a little bit low there and couldn't quite get his legs Williams got hooked by Mitchell Cavs had one to give seems to be one of those games where Jarrett Allen is everywhere yeah certainly has been here in this first half and remember the Thunder are without hartstein he headed to the bench with a little over 6 minutes remaining in the second quarter as he picked up his third foul Jed alen a pelvis injury early in the season played only 10 games he is expected back toward the end of the year they certainly of course lose some size of big Chet out of the line up as Williams spins it back to Gilgeous-Alexander he'll lean and Miss Allen grabs another rebound that's his six and he altered that shot by G this Alexander he tried to shoot over Jer that just ain't happening mitel weaves his way inside Allan got a hand on it out Prince Williams back and fourth we go yeah this is a who Flinch his first type basketball game nice pass oh to Allen Allen leads the Cavs at scoring rebounding and assists here in this first half he has 15 points on just six shots from the field Gilgeous-Alexander can't hit that's rebounded by Mitchell he checks the shot clock and there's a six-second difference between game clock and shot clock it's the kind of half you expect from 230 win teams I agree 100% this has been a difficult game Mitchell right down the tee the defense he hammers it home with an explosive dunk the spider attacks wasn't expecting that they thought he would back off that cross over shot slamed that baby home Dort a contested three and that's the way you want to end the half right there the Cavs get a couple of stops a big Donovan Mitchell done as these teams have gone Toe to Toe throughout the first two quarters neither team has blinked Mitchell right down the lane just G gorgeous as his Cavaliers take a three-point lead into the locker room yeah this is what I anticipated as far as the type of game we would see there's not going to be big runs in this basketball game you're going to have to play your best basketball each possession and out just like a chess match whoever's left standing will be the winner Max Strus and the Cavaliers put 37 on the Thunder in the second quarter and now Max joins Serena Thanks joh Max just describe the intensity of this first half for you guys start what 36 game of the year but it feels like a playoff atmosphere in here uh it's a lot of fun um we came we brought it they're a good team though we got to buckle down and and be better on the defensive end in the second half hey what are the little things that can separate this team coming out of halftime uh we just got to keep them out of our paint um protect our paint keep force them in the tough twos U and then get out and run and transition appreciate you no problem coming up on the Ken G the Kia halftime report AC and Kay taking a look at the first half Brad's got a breakdown and I've got an assistant coach all coming up right here on FanDuel Sports Network we welcome you back to the start of the third quarter Cavalier 62 Thunder 59 Williams finds Harin he float it up and float it in John Michael Brad dhy and Serena Winters thanks so much for joining us on this Wednesday evening as Darius Garland will find Dean Wade these teams start the second half the way they started the ball game as Garland thought about it three goes to Mitchell for a long range triple that's rebounded by Gilgeous-Alexander yeah I think the Cavs figured a little something out that second quarter 12 big points in the paint did a good job of getting a lot of good point blink shots with Evan Mobley being aggressive around that bask you got to continue that Hartenstein with another floater that's his game tell you he he's the most improved player in the league I mean he he he has absolutely turned himself into one heck of a center and uh it it's just been remarkable to watch there's one heck of a center as well as Jarrett Allen twists and scores Allan fine night continues he has 17 points six rebounds and four assists he leads the Cavs in all three of those categories Williams steps back for three that's tipped the foul is called it's on Mitchell moments ago Serena caught up with Cav's assistant coach Trevor Henry thanks Sean coach Jarrett Allen and Evan had phenomenal first half what were you guys able to manipulate defensively to find that Advantage yeah it helps that they're just bigger than them too right like you know we know that they they play small just because of their personnel and they're not a great defensive rebounding team so the emphasis of those two guys to keep putting pressure on their uh defensive glass what's one factor that you think this game's going to come down to in the end for you guys our ability to keep them off the free throw line take care of the ball on offense and again to punish them down down low in in the paint and on the offensive glass I love it I asked for one you gave me three got it guys Mobley with a terrific finish of a sensational Garland feed after a Gilgeous-Alexander scooping score the last time down Cavs by one opening minutes third quarter Williams float scores and gets fouled Williams now has 15 here's that feed by Garland yeah beautiful pass by Darius and then you come the other end with the drive Donovan got caught on the backside hard foul the foul is on Mitchell it is his third so he's the first Cavalier with three Wallace and hartenstein HF three for the Thunder Garland is pressured by Cason Wallace now picked up by hartenstein on the switch off it goes to Wade jonovan Mitchell works on Gilgeous-Alexander the shot clock now shows five Mitchell down the alley puts it up Allen there for the rebound he had it slapped away Williams Glides into the FL Court dumps off to hartenstein he banks and scores hartenstein now has a dozen and Denny Atkinson Stomps onto the floor and he is really giving it to crew chief John Goble he thought there should have been a foul at the other end as Allen went up for the shot it's a good one Brewing here inside rocket mortgage Fieldhouse as we take a look at the live odds courtesy of FanDuel you can take the Thunder minus 2 and A2 right now atus 108 you get two and A2 for the Cavs atus 120 over under 2362 over plays at - 118 under at - 110 it has been a back and forth of fear 17 lead changes the largest lead for either Club has been nine about what we expected yeah coming in I I thought it would be a possession game like I said originally you know you're going to you going to match possessions to this basketball team and and mistakes are will be you know the thing at the end that will be exacerbated so you got to do the best you can play mistake-free basketball and be aggressive and be smart and uh we've seen a lot of that on both sides of the basketball that's why such a close game right now fourpoint ball game points up turnovers Cavs have the advantage 1210 always critical against this Thunder team Garland teardrop he scores and gets fouled as Darius Garland has a chance for the three-point play well he turned the corner no one stepped to help he goes right by Alexander got fouled right there got fouled again nice job but there is not stopping to look to pass the basketball no one came to help Hartenstein a little bit late getting there we see that tear drop every night Gilgeous-Alexander becomes the third Thunder player with three fouls joining Wallace and hartenstein we early in the third the Thunder lead is one goas Alexander gets to the foul line fires over Wade Gilgeous-Alexander has taken 20 shots and he has 20 points Cavs have made him work here's Mitchell he'll relay to Garland Garland works on Williams turns the corner another tier drop a block is called and Garland has another chance for three that could be four on Alexander right more good news Gilgeous-Alexander and here he is on the other end with a 15-footer I wonder if he had feet in the restricted area Brad he did both heels were in here new to the game you can't draw a charge in there so that is four on the Thunder's Premier player Garland with back-to- back traditional three-point plays has tied this game at 72 Wallace bounces off to hartenstein Williams comes and gets it he's defended by Mitchell tough shot oh really tough shot but a good defense by the C Cavaliers made him put that basketball up and shoot it fading away going laterally that's a tough shot wait for three and the lead got it Dean Wade is taken only three shots he has hit all three and he has eight points as Wade is giv the Cavs a 7574 lead Mobley defended Allen with the steel Here Comes Mitchell Mitchell for three arenstein Gilgeous-Alexander works on Allen that's his first triple on his sixth three-point attempt Thunder 77 Cavaliers 75 Mobley works on Williams petts a number of times he'll find Wade Wade again he's got another excellent ball Movement by the Cavaliers EV Mo could have easily shot that basketball maybe even draw a foul but picked a better route better shot wide open Dean Wade scores again Hartenstein appeared to travel as he dumped off the Wallace and the cow's bench is Le just Le Garland angles off an allen screen a contested three is tipped by Allen Allen got grabbed by Hartenstein so the fouls are really starting to mount for the Thunder Hartenstein has picked up his Force fourth team Ser Gilgeous-Alexander already has four did he travel you be the judge Kenny still hot darland to trigger Mobley inside H to Allen how about that big to Big And arenstein basically ducked brat he's playing with four foul he had no choice but to get out of the way great attack by Evan as well as Jarrett both very aggressive might as well go at him dor he'll look to penetrate he got cut off Hartenstein tries to display some range it thuds off the backboard the Cavs have the basketball and an 8079 lead Garland tears down the lane scores with the left hand about the aggressiveness of Garland going in leaning in with that shoulder shooting a tough shot daring gets a delay game War it because he headed the basketball after it went through can't touch it once he go through that iron was having a little fun tough shot by Darius Garland good job Garland all of a sudden has 16 points and five assists here's Williams Williams picked up by Garland that's the pen straight again across the lane finds Hartenstein just says that little floater shot putting type motion and you you forget every time he's left-handed you know you go for that right handed he just shoots that little shot foot Carling off to Allen Allen takes his time he got hartenstein in the air another patient move by Allen who's having another Ultra efficient evening he's eight of 10 Williams he got fou by Garland what am I doing Darlin wants an explanation Allen has been under control all night yeah he's going right at Hartenstein Hartenstein can't has nothing nothing to do with it gets the arm hook there they're really good at sticking that arm underneath and grasping the defender's arm drawing the foul Thunder team features a number of elite drivers led by Gilgeous-Alexander Williams Wallace he'll bounce off and by d d challenge all that idea here come the Cavaliers with numbers Garland off to Levert extra pass to Strus K knocks it down big transition basket great defense by the Cavaliers leading to that opportunity taking full advantage Ma Strus has drilled four triples the Cavaliers make it happen on the defensive end as jar and Allen with the rejection on the D shot the Cavs are on a 92 run as the turf war between the top dogs in each conference continues I've been playing against Chase since high school though so uh we always had these battles um yeah but tonight it's going to be super fun hopefully a lot of highlights and some fun stuff so so people can can watch and see well Garland and Gilgeous-Alexander certainly have provid an ample highlights tonight and what has been a beauty here in Cleveland so far they've absolutely put on a show on both ends of the floor and it's just been a heavyweight battle a big time brawl between these two teams a lot of fun thus far got a lot of basketball left let's see how they see how it all shakes out Joe out of the timeout he fires a three that's his first triple it trims the Cavs lead to 8784 we pass the Midway point of the third quarter as Garland throws on the break Allen another offensive rebound it's his Fifth and he hammers it home what a brilliant night for Jarrett Allen yeah he just pinned hartstein under that basket and just pushed him out of the way took that basketball from him great job by Jarrett Allen Joe misses badley bounce pass by SCU was too ambitious picked off by Williams Williams gallops down the lane draws a foul that was the Cav's first turnover of this third quarter a third in which they've hit 11 of 16 shots Serena was back behind the Cavalier huddle at that last time out Serena what do you have yeah the message was simple just keep wearing them down no middle no back doors and look Jarrett Allen has been doing a great job protecting that Rim all night Kenny said look man just

Season see the efficiency there in his numbers third in the league in field goal percentage this is already the eighth time this season he's had a 20110 and five games down by three Williams bounces

Williams he banks and misses but gets fouled really like that zone look by the Cavaliers though make it a little bit more difficult to get a clean look because you're your defend pending areas you see

47 wow that is a 70% winning percentage Yeah you get him on the floor you got a good shot there's no doubt about it better than average no doubt about it shot at winning basketball games so glad he's

on Levert that pass fors out of bounds Well Done by Caris as Caris third dog Gilgeous-Alexander the length of the floor absolutely caris was in his lap he had nowhere to go forced him to throw an Eric

defense by the Cavs didn't give up any inch towards the basket Dort just made a lucky shot you live with that LeVert from the wing Dort rebounds Wiggins now inside that is this game's 24th lead change tell what going at it very mature basketball team on OKC side they they get good shots Cavaliers just really Dynamic and complex on the offensive end creates opportunities well Mitchell continues to open up wide open threes and that time it's Levert who takes advantage You're Expecting Donovan to go off at any second and OKC is as well he's just continuing to be a cond Joe missed it rebounded however by Wiggins who lays it in and we're knocked up at 100 Mitchell directs traffic 40 ticks to go in the third he wants a Strus screen uhoh Strus knocked down dork Mitchell steps back a fire over two and dra it nice job Max Strus comes up set a big screen nice job just real physical basketball by the Cavaliers Big Shot by Donovan both teams have shot it well here in this third G just out Alexander got cut off but he still hits a tough shot a little fade away he's got is hard to get to he's so long and he he pushes so far back away from you talking about Alexander and it shot so smooth that's an interesting spacing to shoot the ball the shot clock is off Mitchell looks for an opening he'll work on Joe Donovan Mitchell goes to work steps back for a long two score the third quarter three quarters are complete Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers have a one-point Edge on the Oklahoma City Thunder the 31 and four Cavs the 30 and5 Thunder the war on the Eerie Shore heads to the fourth in the dire we got to move for the new reevolution yeah we got to move thanks to Pat phoh and our terrific production truck and those pictures and highlights it has been tight throughout 26 lead changes the largest lead for either Club has been nine 12 minutes remain the battle for Supremacy in the NBA and off we go here in the fourth yeah it's just been a a a bludgeoning every possession you know it's just hard to either one team scores then the other team scores somebody stops the other stop so it's just you know two like I say two similar basketball teams just it's it's a battle Testament a wheel Mobley can't get it to go and then Mobley gets called for a foul he'll start this fourth quart with Mitchell Strus Levert andang did he foul dor we got him right there he tried to go around behind look like Joe I believe it was I beg your pardon Joe you're right I swap that ball Away Joe let that go he's out here with dor Gilgeous-Alexander Wiggins and Kenrich Williams here is Joe we talked about him earlier he's the guy that hunts for his threes got to recognize that coach Atkinson told these guys know number 11 catches that basketball get up on him it's going up Mobley hands off the truce he's chased by Joe SCU has five threes here tonight lbert works on Aaron Wiggins Tred to send that inside to Mobley and the G get bailed out by a Kenrich Williams foul number Kenrich can't believe ites over the back of Mobley there to get to that basketball grab the shirt as well he did that's close though I mean he had to grab the shirt Hope was losing balance a little bit may have gotten away with it but we put his hand on him that's a foul Isaac Okoro returns he played Seven Minutes in the first half and his return to action as George Niang buries a three that's a big shot George Niang they're not expecting that they know that's what George does but he was not that he wasn't warm in the first half he can make a lot of those shots that's a big basket George has been strong as of late here's a Williams for three that's short rebounded by max Niang over his last 11 games he's been shooting threes of 49% of Okoro good play to keep that in bounds he tipped to the sideline and kept The Possession alive Mitchell got Stripped by Joe dor send it ahead to Joe meang fouled D from behind takes off George gives him a little pop there three to foul no clear path or transition take George made a legit play on the ball that wipes out transition take and also Donovan Mitchell is back behind the play that takes away any possibility of a clear path foul that fouls on Niang as he picks up another one quickly that time he bumped Gilgeous-Alexander give a little shot there friendly little gesture in the neighborhood wa welcome to the neighborhood that's already the thir foul on the Cavs Okoro defending Gilgeous-Alexander Bo nice to see big number 35 back in the line up he missed eight games with that shoulder Sprain and he's inching him back into the lineup Okoro played 7 Minutes in the first half we can get back to the level he was playing fantastic basketball Isaac was shooting that ball just at a remarkably high level and his defense is always spectacular Mitchell draws a crowd and we have a 3 second violation it's going to be on the Cavaliers second violation 950 remains in this fourth quarter Mobley planted himself inside he thought either Mitchell would shoot it wow for it went back to Nia he thought that shot was going to go up all right 945 to go C 106 Thunder 105 go to Alexander back it goes to Wiggins Wiggins down the lane dumps off to Williams Williams almost walked try to find Jalen Williams out of bows it goes last off Jalen C basketball that all happened because of Evan Mobley they had the dribble drive by Williams and he did not want to shoot that basketball with Evan Mobley standing around down in that lane AR D is going to challenge the question is did it hit Niang's foot last before that ball rolled out of B yeah went off on somebody's foot there hard attack we'll check it all out when we come back remind you that Cavs basketball on FanDuel Sports network is brought to you by your local Toyota dealers for

Jerome has checked in he gave the Cavs a big boost as roce works his way to the basket he flips it up in over Williams started to say that Cavaliers tie Jerome gave the Cavaliers a big boost off the bench in the first half he scored seven points in six minutes dished out and assist Williams lost it davs ball it was Strus who defended so we you know you're talking about this call was called on Evan Mobley earlier as a walk the same thing gavs 108 Thunder 107 Mobley started by Kenrich Williams goes to SCU gets it back Mobley takes his time and lays it in very smart he did he gathered himself knew there was no one that could stop him didn't make that extra pass went ahead and did the thing to be selfish sometimes with that basketball and Williams rebounded by mowley Max Strus missed the first nine weeks with an ankle injury this has been his best game by far here goes Mitchell he had it knocked away ball will stay with the Cavs as here was a terrific feed by Max spru who already has five threes in his back pocket yeah he usually comes off firing and the defense is expecting him they're trying to trying to make sure he doesn't cut that corner or get too many too far out because he shoots so quick create a huge gap nice pass Mitchell finds Strus through the hands of Bley it went Gilgeous-Alexander watch here by by screws picked up by Ty Jerome under eight to go Gilgeous-Alexander tries to draw a foul and he gets it that is number four on the Cavs here in this fourth quarter so the Thunder will shoot free throws the rest of the way as Darius Garland Jarrett Allen and Dean Wade file back into the ball game Wallace and hartenstein turn for OKC Wallace finds Gilgeous-Alexander he's picked up by Garland and Jerome it's Jerome with a steal here goes Ty Jerome Jerome to the bucket lays it up and lays it in I tell you that's just a typical Ty Jerome high IQ basketball play stood right there defensively didn't leave his his post and stole that basketball nice job and three is no good out of bounds last off of cor the Cavs through his Zone in the last two times down and paid off with this Jerome steel that's just being very disciplined by Ty Jone right there he goes over to help doesn't leave that post doesn't leave that position to wander back to his guy get his hand on that basketball and then we've seen him just be magical at scoring the basketball the Cavaliers are on a 60 run which ordinarily doesn't mean much but on a night like tonight might as well be 16 oh this is to separate yourself these two teams there have been 30 lead changes this evening unbeliev what do you say we stick with 30 the rest of the way that' be great s and a half to go arenstein had it poked Away by Guess Who it's Ty Jerome Ty Jerome is just does he does so many things so well he's just a guy who plays winning basketball like you always say John and he's coming in right now and been the difference Jerome at his own speed Ty Jerome slow walk walks a bucket he's a perfect five for five for 11 points in 8 minutes the Cavs have taken a seven-point lead tell you what Ty Jerome has been a differen maker in this game first time we've been able to take this kind of lead I'm going to give the credit to Ty Jerome and that guy right there Jarrett Allen Allen with the steel it's Garland on the Hop he'll find Jerome and Jerome walked Ty Jerome with the second steal of this quarter this time hartenstein was the victim yeah really good Defender takes a chance there A lot of times they'll call a foul but he did a good job hitting nothing but basketball then that little floater he got such good touch on the basketball does toome can score it effectively in a MRI of BL the intensity is picked up again in this building hartenstein he has 16 he also has nine rebounds and a team High eight assists every one of them's been that left-handed hook Garland cut off by Wallace tries it again garland that rebounded by hartenstein Gilgeous Alexander he banks and misses he appeared to be out of bounds when he grabbed that ball off it goes to Wallace oh brother wow okay it's a two-point game 555 to go Jerome from the Cavalier logo plays through Wade and goes and gets it back Dr Works in on Joe he floats it up he missed it Allen gets it back to Jerome Okoro Allen got grabbed by Hartenstein who's picked up as fth Jarrett Allen will not be denied no not at all his second did Gilgeous-Alexander have his foot in bounds but he touched the ball see that again out of bounds he's standing out of bounds we're looking right at it I mean it's not that difficult led directly to a three is Ty Jerome in traffic he'll float and score Ty Jerome has simply been dazzling off the Cavalier Bay Williams pestered by Garland back it goes to Gilgeous-Alexander he'll work on Okoro his elbow jumper is true really good defense by Darius Garland there getting up high on that screen being very physical K Jerome has just been dominant since he's come into this basketball game Jerome to the foul line he gets fouled by Williams they have no answer for Ty Jerome period he is absolutely shredding these guys great job Ty under number eight Jalen Williams third Williams picks up his third he just plays at his own pace This Ti Jerome you can't speed him up knows where he wants to go where he wants to get to and he just does that you can become an All-Star today Cavs kids club memberships are available for fans ages 12 and under Vis A cavs.com kidsclub to sign up today this man at the line is six of seven from the field a pair of assists a pair of steals and we've seen him do it multiple times throughout the season so this is not an anomaly this is who he is he has been remarkable for this basketball team come on clevel under five to go sh Gilgeous-Alexander finds Williams Williams pedal to the paint L dor bounces inside to hartenstein who bobbles puts it up three ejected by Allen Jarrett Allen just absolutely timed that perfectly waiting on him to go up and went up with him even strong Donovan Mitchell the fourth quarter is his time they love it here're inside rocket Morgan Fieldhouse Cavs by seven just an electric atmosphere this place is hopping Williams nowhere to go inside the hartenstein he missed it Allen altered the shot but back it goes to Jason Wallace second chance for the Thunder Gilgeous-Alexander looks to penetrate he'll float and score it has just been a battle all night long punch after counter punch Ty Jerome got knocked off balance here's Lou Dort he'll chug into the four Court Dort got

lost since December 1st listen to that overation well that young man deserves one Ty Jerome absolutely lit this place up nice job Ty great job great effort dor makes both Ty Jerome heads to the Cavalier bench with 15 points eight of which came in this fourth quarter Allen off the Mobley they can make that looks so easy over the top to Allan Mobley burst out of the corner C by five yeah they make it look easy and it's not that's a difficult pass for Jarrett to make and he does it effortlessly great communication that's assist number six Allen he runs Dort off the line it's playay by Wallace to keep that ball inbound Dort looks to penetrate has to stop because Allen was there to TI of the air as Mobley took it away from hartenstein Jarrett Allen changed and altered that shot give him a lot of credit nice rebound by Evan it's all about grasping and getting possessions these next three minutes Darin looks for an opening he's guarded by Gilgeous-Alexander Garland on the bounds got Gilgeous-Alexander to reach he'll Lo it up it's tipped and grabbed by Dort 245 to go Gilgeous-Alexander down hill Mobley cut him off Williams thought about a three spru is out there however Gilgeous-Alexander again gets the foul called John cobal says it's on the floor however that's academic as the Cavs are over the limit so Gilgeous-Alexander will shoot free throws way when we come back great theater here in downtown Cleveland couple of big block shots he's just been dominant in that paint just not yielding at all and the communication between he and Jarrett Allen on those multiple alley plays has been fun to watch and watching this transpire over the last couple of Seasons these guys have becoming Unstoppable they have dominated that interior and we're going to need more of that over these next two minutes Aria ingame Player Pro profile I like the Cavs two starting bigs 42 points is one thing but how do you like 18 rebounds 13 combined assists both men Ultra efficient this evening as down the stretch we come with 233 to go the Cavs cling to a 123 118 lead Gilgeous-Alexander has taken 26 shots from the field he's hit half of them he now has 30 points on on the evening that's his season average there you see the numers it just doesn't seem like he's taken that many shots I guess he has he's he's come on strong Cav's done a good job against him tonight though Garland Mitchell Mobley Allen and Strus are on the floor over the top it goes to Mobley Mobley takes a dribble knock Williams back Allen's there a foul is called and thunder action caught a break that that foul was called because Allen was set to clean that up Dort picks up the personal Mobley will shoot free throws we saw this play work earlier in the quarter and there the Cavs go again he got got fouled twice there got fouled initially by Williams then he gets fouled going to the basket there so good strong move it Movement by Evan typical though going to the Rim Yeah they charged that foul to Dort I thought Williams he did got him at first did too oy's first is good download the Cavs app and play Cavs pick them for a chance to win a pair of Cavs United memberships in over $150 in prizes download the Cavs app and play Cavs pick them now Cavs big men are flirting with triple doubles as Morley missed the second Morley has eight rebounds seven assists Allen 10 rebounds six assists he approach the two-minute Mark Williams gets to the Elbow off the heart Stein oh he has not missed with that floater last two minutes of play it's a two-point game Garland Works into the four Court he's picked up by Williams on the switch now it's Hartenstein the shot clock shows six gin works on Hartenstein step back fre Allen had it for a minute a foul is called and it's on Gilgeous-Alexander Jarrett Allen tonight has grabbed six offensive rebounds that will not count as one but he got fouled by Gilgeous-Alexander with that hustle Gilgeous-Alexander now has five like hartenstein and Allen has two big free throws yeah look how far away he is from the basket that's what Jarrett does so well in rebounding the ball is he chases that ball you know today's game there's so many long shots and if you have the the effort you'll get these rebounds if you go after him and he does man with just ferocity Allen's run six big fouls Mobley with a big play right there as Allen missed the second but Mobley poked it up top so here's Mitchell 90 seconds to go Mitchell pulls up Allen again he had it knocked away and out of bounds that is offensive rebound number seven the good news is that the Cavs have the ball the bad news is that they have only two and a half seconds with which to work as that is a big time play by Evan Mobley that was a huge opportunity for the Cavs Evan great job tapping that ball out still have a chance here to take advantage of that got to get need to get a bucket here mitel has D in front of him he'll go to Mobley he wants it back Mo's got to shoot it he just got it off in time he gets it off iron Allen was there he pokes it to Mitchell but a foul is called it's on the Cavs says John goal Donovan is already calling for a challenge wow Mitchell was whistled for the foul and Kenny's going to challenge so Kenny wants to take a look at this as do we look here see did Mitchell commit a foul here no timeout Cleveland coaches challenged challenging a defensive foul caught on the floor yeah I like I like the have chances on that one yeah unless we didn't see something Brad John goo was right there and John goo is the crew chief he's on the right he will be the one in contact with the NBA replay Center and the Cavs are hoping that he reverses his own call yeah yeah I don't I don't did Mitchell foul Dort you can see Dort holding the shirt there of Mitchell yep he's got a handful of donalan shirt D did lunge forward but I don't think Mitchell pushed him forward boy it doesn't look like it there no so we await the verdict 119 to go a critical call as the Cavaliers look to keep possession Kenny has won challenges at a nice clip so far this year his Cavs are 31-4 the thunder come into this building 30 and five winners of 15 straight this challenge is taking a long time John goo on the right Ray aosta our referee this evening is on the left Jarrett Allen has grabbed a season High eight offensive rebounds eight of his 12 Donovan Mitchell took a peak up at the humongonaut lead after three did Mitchell foul number five dor the lower right hand corner of your screen I just don't think that's a foul might be after review Mitchell does not extend his arm into D's back therefore the contact has been de marginal at the time of the whistle there was imminent possession as Donathan Mitch had the basketball it will be Cleveland's basketball the challenge is successful well done Kenny good job by John goo in the replay Center acknowledges he made a mistake they get it right that's fine 100% that's the way it's supposed to work got no problem with that that was a good challenge the better news is that the ball went into the hands of Donovan Mitchell that's the second thing they check who would have imminent possession so that means the Cavs have the basketball had it been a loose ball it would be a jump ball at Center Court so possession would be in question it is not here so the casts will inbound with 119 to go and 14 on the shot clocks protecting a 125 122 lead huge possession for the Cavaliers with a limited clock you got to get a good look at this maybe get something going to the basket try to draw a foul if you need to but you've got to get a good shot Allen leaned on by Williams finds Mobley Mobley's checked by hartenstein who plays with five fouls Mobley halfway down the alley he floats and scores a clutch bucket by the seven-footer gives the Cavaliers a five-point lead right at Hartenstein with those five fouls Evan Mobley's just been dominant inside No Doubt good play Hartenstein from the nail once DOR can't find him K just Alexander instead up near the timeline he'll look to penetrate he scoots it off the window Hartenstein had it knocked Away by Mobley here comes Strus Strus throws on the brakes wisely giving it back to Garland Garland eats clock the Cavs lead by five Darlin finally gets loose from Wallace the shot clock now shows six Garland down the lane he Scoops and scores timeout Thunder this place is on fire the Cleveland Cavaliers in this battle between the top teams in each conference have taken a seven-point lead with 27 ticks to go that timeout execute
