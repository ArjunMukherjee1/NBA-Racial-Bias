Sacramento Austin Reaves controls the bonus on Davis Keegan Murray checking LeBron roas on the switch with LeBron now Murray guarding Davis shot clock is at six Davis goes to the turnaround here's an offensive rebound Katie that's one thing you talked about leading this game yeah and absolutely one of the things that they're trying to do is they're trying to get that switch so that Keegan Murray is guarding Anthony Davis and they can post him up on the low block and that also leaves you really susceptible for offensive boards because Domantas heing 26 points Thursday against the Lakers I think pace is going to be really important tonight kle for the Kings and I don't just mean in the full court their Pace in the half court is what makes them really special and it's a little bit slowed down against this Lakers team Katie your two keys for rebounding and turnovers First Kings possession a turnover first Lakers possession and offensive rebound right Kings figure out to take away that Advantage from La so LeBron heads to the line for two that last foul is on Keegan Murray his first and that slows the game monumentally there was 52 total free throws attempted just a couple nights ago and that really slows the tempo of the game so these are areas where the kings are going to have to be challenged to really pick up the pace and try to avoid fouling 25 free throws made Thursday night for the Lakers as Malik Monk looks to turn the corner stops on the dive goes left hand no Here Comes LeBron and that's not a block for Anthony Davis but it is Rui Hachimura on the leak out from LeBron Lakers with an early for a lead back com to [Applause] Kings Le thought about it instead LeBron picks up his first personal and has some words right there for Kevin Scott I don't understand though what are workas calling for it on the low block against Davis six on the clock sabonis trying to Big Boy Davis Davis comes away with the block remember he had six the other night on the kick out chrisy catches shoot and the Lakers remember they started off just like this Thursday night 70 lead and Mike Brown tried to use his time out as well to stop these types of runs and it ended up in a situation down the stretch of the game where he didn't have a timeout I believe the last four minutes Omas going to the strong hand and that's how you get points in the paint against Anthony Davis the two other times you had Malik getting downhill on him trying to shoot over the top of him and then Domantas in single coverage having to create his own space that doesn't work as well as the two-man [Applause] game Austin Reaves averaging better than 21 points per game against the Kings over his last four makes it a 9-2 ball [Music] game mon te's up a three aimore clears the rebound Davis trying to get deep position against Domantas De'Aaron came with the help in transition bu lost control of it LeBron comes away with it it throws to Mike Brown a lot great camera angle there from our crew high above Golden One Center Here Comes De'Aaron Fox oh he trying to put chrisy and a blender oh everything but the layup but De'Aaron will have two Fox knocks down the pick Murray checking LeBron here as he crosses the timeline LeBron full head of steam getting right to the there's got to be two other options behind him to to cut LeBron off not wanting to let him get to the paint that easy there was a defensive breakdown for sure LeBron on the switch out another turn over there how many turnovers do we see trying to throw the ball to Domantas in the post Mike Brown talked about putting that ball up high don't look for bounce passes or for passes where the small guard can steal it and I like that box out though by Keegan Murray and it leads to a bucket in transition he's someone that has done an excellent job um on the defensive end in terms of taking on all different kinds of matchups from point guards to centers um but also on the boards he's been phenomenal and the Kings got a bucket out of the last one and here they are again another shot at it to R roen now in attack mode nice kick out Domantas Corner three came up short and on Q Keegan Murray almost being able to come up with that offensive board in transition yeah so you're doing everything you're supposed to there's going to be plays like that where you don't end up coming up with that 50/50 Ball but the hustle is important Murray looking to answer box with the hustle play Murray right into the chest Davis is there you cannot go up nonchalant with Anthony Davis in the paint meanwhile LeBron oh they're going to give him the and one Rodney M said we saw right there and back to the point I was saying Kyle you cannot go into that paint without expecting that he's going to be there have a plan you cannot be nonchalant with the ball so LeBron unable to complete the three-point play the Lakers with 15 points 11 of them coming by way of Fast [Music] Break here's the Roose box on the blow by travel and and that's Anthony Davis the Davis effect right nearly threw it away tries to force his way and he does throw it away turnover Here Comes Malik Monk in transition decides to pull it back Derozan out to Keegan contested jumper K's having some issues offensively just two of nine from the field 22% mention this Lakers defense over the last four number one in defensive rating second behind OKC over the last five yeah it's something that they've definitely been looking to improve upon two on the clock LeBron with a tough three nice box out there here comes sabonis with the ri and run leaves it for Malle out of bounds play but they're just lacking Domantas too strong on the 18-footer a lid on the basket here as of late for Sacramento only seven points Midway through the first Reaves stops pops and one Austin Reaves will head his early career unable to make the free throw Here Comes Tomas looking a push with Pace here Kings down by 10 Derozan still has not taken a shot Gabe Vincent on the floor for Los Angeles now they're just switching everything right now is the Lakers Huerter with a good look at one here comes Austin [Applause] re they run a double at Davis Reaves three-pointer I mean you look at the Lakers as well they're you know running some really nice plays just struggle with haven't been able to convert goas this time free throw jumper is [Applause] good off the steel Keon took his lunch money and that's how Keon comes in and makes the passes and he's going to jump in passing lanes and get some easy buckets might have gave C here at home not where they want to be how critical I mean you still got and you're getting a look at just how dominant the western conference is and it's going to be really hard to make up ground so that's why every game at this point is so critical D'Angelo Russell Fresh Off the Bench knocks down a three Russell makes it a 20-2 Lakers lead coming up on four minutes to go here in the first I I think man D'Angelo Russell with fell asleep there defensively he wasn't guarding anybody getting some some good looks are the yeah see I mean they've created some nice shots just not shooting the ball well and that has been a common theme here in the early going this season and part of the reason why they find themselves where they are it's not about anything like not having the pieces it's just about people struggling and not being able to execute here's Derozan getting to his spot from 17 Bullseye tough tough shot there by Demar Derozan that's his first attempt and his first bucket of the game and they're going to make him work hard Derozan with three points remember he only had 10 the other night as Russell oh man late whistle right there and Derozan really pay attention to it Isaac Jones on the floor De'Aaron Fox back on the floor as well eight-point deficit for Sacramento here's Kevin Huerter trying to slice his way over Anthony Davis and without LeBron James on the floor and he's been out for some some time I mean you want to hope that the Kings can really kind of cut into that Lakers lead but the Lakers have done a pretty good job of trying to hold them off Davis he's trying to go one on five out there and got ripped Kings now down by six G ro oh he put him in the basket Katie Rui Hachimura put his head down and immediately started quarter as well so you know I'm not sure kind of it's suddenly become an issue right hasn't it hasn't been kind of something we've seen all season like a couple years ago when it was third quarters that were troubling but you know they've got to find a way to come out better and correct that Gab Vincent picking up where he left off on Thursday knock it down to three he had 12 the other night and shot the ball well and if you look at his numbers his three-point shooting numbers are not high but you got to look P back to you know his time in Miami where his last couple years shot the mess out of the ball from Deep stocked in zone as Keon Ellis answers back rattling one home man Keon's giving him some great minutes yes he is he is just finding ways to impact the game in little ways on both ends so LeBron back on the floor here's D conect 17th overall pick got his pocket pick here's Keon in transition Isaac Jones with the contact and they're going to call an offensive foul game Keon and De'Aaron in the back court for the Kings De'Aaron now guarding LeBron on the [Applause] post and no help at all as LeBron throws it down vient I mean that is a mistake by Isaac Jones right there I don't know where the hesitation was he was kind of clearing the lane and going the opposite direction Ellis looking for his second triple but Keegan man he is consistently crashing that offensive glass here he is trying to check LeBron now and LeBron James tough Leander he's the first player in double figures he's got 10 and gab vinent picking De'Aaron Fox Up full court but that isoul a foul right there 36 minutes on Thursday turned 27 yesterday as we know that helps his game just a little bit seven points for De'Aaron here in the first [Applause] quarter Vincent on the kick out High arer Drew nothing but air Here Comes Keon we got an 8sec differential on the clocks here trying to put Koloko in some action here oh Fox Blows By him oh man he's like that October wind he blew right by Koloko just smoked [Applause] him under 10 to play here in the [Applause] first James off the one leg wow that is a tough tough shot but we've seen him make it time and time again Munich and that is an area where they have struggled from the beginning oh De'Aaron nice little F Isaac Jones De'Aaron Fox playing him allaround ball game can do some damage spread him out get to the paint cam reddish seeing his first action today Keegan staying in guarding LeBron LeBron 12 points in that first quarter going with the Skyhook Jones with the block and they're going to say gold tending great job of trying to to be a force around the rim Fox on the turn around now Cash Money de'arra Fox pitching the shut out he's got 11 points a perfect three for three from the field four for four from the line how about this match up here Jones against James you got to wish him luck that's what you do all right came up with the stop Kings a chance to tie this up here with a three ball as Keegan puts it on the deck oh goes right to the cup nice aggressive decisive yes decision right there by Keegan Murray his first field goal makes it a one-point game I mean he is putting in a ton of work on the defensive end of the floor man D'Angelo wrestle sometimes he just I mean huge confidence we know that but yeah I mean he's been in the starting lineup he's obviously been an Allstar his time in Brooklyn he was phenomenal but you know his name is surface as a piece that the Lakers are trying to potentially move Kevin Huerter in and out Murray contact foul on Koloko so let's see if they can continue on that path here in the second quarter well something Mike Brown has talked about even going back before Thursday's game this Lakers team they want to punish you in the paint and on the glass oh yes message received so far as Murray gets hit by a ma truck very familiar with LeBron James so he can offer some advice on how to take on that match up Mike Brown former coach of Lebron in Cleveland who went to the NBA finals together when they lost to the Spurs all right Kevin Huerter now 10 on the clock Fox guarded by cam reddish waves away Fox want to get busy with it oh reddish got a piece of it and fox already got fouled and yeah frustration foul [Applause] there hurder on the switch with James Rui Hachimura does not get the roll there's that offensive rebound second one for the Lakers Russell Isaac Jones skyed up for it but lost it R to stay with it multiple opportunities here for the Lakers says LeBron goes over Trey Lyles his ground really well Mike Brown however wants to take that time out cuz he knows these are moments where LeBron knows that he can and has to uh kind of flip that switch yeah looking at this Lakers lineup a small lineup as Kevin Huerter unable to cash in oh look at the hustle there by Trey Lyles Trey Day staying with it down down and picks up his dribble Malik top contested Corner three is wet hand in the face from Austin Reaves but it did not matter knocked it down lace that one much needed three right there 4137 Malik's first bucket of The Game Malik now guarding LeBron on the switch let's see if the Kings give him some help here LeBron on the triple Drive triple team he's got 20 I mean there's nothing that you can do about that if you're going to get that switch you know if that's how it's going to be you got to you've got to sense someone right away or just know you're going to die on an island Domantas no he got hit no call Here Comes LeBron James extra pass cam reddish open for a corner three as Domantas to grab and go sabonis out to Huerter had a great look at it got it touch paint spray three Kevin has had a few really good looks hasn't been able to to knock it down hopefully that one is going to open the floodgates you mentioned that spray three that's something Mike Brown always talks about they only had four spray three attempts in the second half the other night it's imperative for their offense to be able to put the ball on the floor but I felt like they didn't they didn't look to stop and spray they look to go all the way and that's where Anthony Davis was so critical defensively Russell with the hands 14 on the clock pushing the pace in transition that's your Center kind of leading the charge there Kings 10 assist on 14 made baskets here's Derozan thought about a 16-footer five on the clock now raises up that's a tough tough shot Davis back on the floor with the rebound oh Reaves he got his pocket pick oh M breaking ankles uhoh we're going to stay here a foul on the Lakers everything but the that foul is on Hachimura his first we got another foul yep that you're not going to draw those fouls you're you're helping the defense in that way so nice job by Demar Derozan on that last one here's Derozan now they run a double at him extra pass yeah he had Austin Reaves oh Malik oh redish met him at the top 24 second violation and then his ability with his handle to get deep in the paint lot of size on from his defender on that one tough shot oh oh Davis oh wow late whistle oh there was very little contact right there but I can see how it was made from the angle that that official to swag and be entered into season long drawings have the chance to win even more exclusive experiences intern now king.com Ultra Courtside but Mike Brown was in a pickle there because because you've already challenge you already used one challenge you do not want to use your second Challenge and it was only gas's first foul yes here's that Twan game oh Davis oh Domantas there with the rebound and put back as Malik slow to get up over here getting some help but there's talk that he might be in the MVP conversation have you I think he should more from from him this year well first of all last year he played more games than he has in his entire career I mean he had a a you know career high 76 Games available and I think availability is a lot of your um capabilities of of being a consistent player as Rui hotar not able to get that one to drop but to me JJ reck is making him a focal point of the offense and putting him in positions where he's going to thrive here he is trying to check Derozan shot clock at nine now Derozan too strong tough tough shot over a shot blocker with size King shooting 42.9% Lakers have gone cold as of late how about that board from Malik monk yeah nice little spray for Keegan Murray yes push that pace touch paint get the ball out to Shooters especially fre in transition those are the shots that you want seven first half points for Keegan Kings with five [Applause] triples Reaves from the foul line goas with the rebound here come the Kings chance to Tire Take the Lead right here Fox thought about it instead goes to the hot hand Murray had a great look JJ reck runs out and looking for his first field goal meanwhile to Kings trailing by two to Derozan going to work over reddish just not getting yeah easy look says De'Aaron I mean he is really had to work for all of his shots he's now two of six from the floor I believe Davis now on the spin throws it away turnover Los Angeles that's their ninth he's convert off of the right that's the key Lakers the other night two days ago had 13 but only nine points off those turnovers for the team reddish one of the better on ball Defenders oh box oh yeah man he had Davis on skates he got that stop on a dime and elevated into that shot that is a way to take away a shot blocker who's scared of your speed first tie of the game oh not it up at 47 Kings looking for their first lead here's Malik oh yeah Flex on him young fella in Sacramento with its first lead of the game after trailing by 10 90 kings run re in the paint box went for the steal to gamble under three to play here in the second goas thought about it Le tur in the corner shot clock at [Applause] seven oh they're going to get Keegan Murray on the push off there that'll be his third personal foul Keegan he stays in the game guarding LeBron James as Russell pulls it back out that's a moving screen on Anthony Davis as Russell makes one of two back to the odd number Lakers up by [Music] one box bottled up triple team plenty of time on the shot clock here Malik monk going high over Davis and Russell with the rebound Kings just 18 of 4 from the field 42.9% and they keep getting this this switch right there this time LeBron passing up the shot but I like how the kings are really trying to fog that paint up LeBron settling for the long three so bonus double digit in rebounds he has 10 now Po's going to work gets the friendly roll just makes it a six from the field I mean not a high volume but a near perfect game from De'Aaron Kings up by one here after trailing by 10 Reaves looking for LeBron oh gets an easy one at The Rim when he gets going and gets downhill whether he has the ball in his hands or not I mean he is so difficult to defend roen hits the deck hard here comes Reaves l out and running step back triple offensive rebound and now Malik Mike telling the defense to go help Russell straight away D'Angelo Russell Off the Bench with 33 into this game tonight but anyone paying attention knows that D'Angelo Russell is a much better three-point shooter in that shot nearly 42% a season ago he's had some big games against sac for his career it'll be Kings basketball at 12 on the we haven't seen Lakers doing a pretty solid job in terms of making it difficult to [Music] execute re shot the Gap there so they go to sabonis five on the clock to roosen too strong goas with the tip no battle for the rebound Second Chance opportunity here Trey Lyles misses that three what a find on the inside no rush for the Kings as monk he pulls one and the bench is up and incensed here as they wanted a foul on that Malik demonstrate what is going on out there let's get a quick all right so Reaves makes a pair it's back to a five-point game shot clock is off [Applause] here JJ reick barking out defensive instructions doesn't matter number five with 17 not a lot from not forcing it at all all right here comes Malik Monk back out to Keegan thought about it oh trying to body LeBron James shot clock down to two yeah they're going to call him for steps bonus now meanwhile Anthony Davis very quiet first half as Malik gets a hand on that one yeah Anthony Davis from an offensive stand Point incredibly quiet his only two points come from the free throw line 0 of four from the field but yes he's done a good job impacting the game on the defensive side and the Kings defensively Lakers with nine turnovers here in this game here's Malik now off the curl has to pull it back out and that's the the Anthony Davis right right De'Aaron Fox oh man he went by three Lakers on that one yeah but a great job reading that because Anthony Davis was pulled away from the basket and de fox went behind him eliminated that threat look at the defense right there from Fox oh man but it breaks down breaks down right there miscommunication between Fox and Malik bunk in terms of what the coverage is supposed to be and if there's a switch here comes to Derozan now box guarded by LeBron oh loses control out of bounds and turnover he he's involved in pretty much every play Reaves catching shoot look at him oh Keegan kept that one alive yep Fox on the leak [Applause] out and the Kings throw it away here comes Reaves in transition Hachimura stop pop no but Davis yes his first field goal and that's where the Kings got themselves in trouble a little bit on Thursday was trying to make some Home Run play that in turnovers then fast break points for the Lakers there's that two-man game here Derozan Corner triple short gets his own rebound stays with it oh he went right at Davis and picks up the foul on Anthony Davis just Davis's first second and third free throws he he shot one and that was the technical was the technical yes knocks down the first allar you got to get involed on that I haven't voted yet today but been voting since day one I was pretty proud of myself for noticing that all right back to a one-point game Kings doing a much better job from the free throw line tonight Thursday they were 68.2% from the field and they forced the turnover 11 turnovers for the Lakers Here Comes Fox spray out Trey Lyles on the floor fox now has to reather here plenty of time on the shot clock Lakers want a double dribble fox says uhuh take these two points instead and he and LeBron having some words right now and one thing we have learned about De'Aaron he does back down to anybody and he does it with a smile on his face too oh LeBron trying to answer back [Applause] NOP King on top by one FOX NOW probing extra pass Trey Lyles ke on the bench with the four personal fouls Derozan and that's just a you know kind of wasted possession have a lot of purpose and it ends up in more fast break points for the Lakers and the Kings did a really great job in the second quarter they allowed 11 fast break points in that first quarter in fact you mentioned it earlier 11 of their Lakers first 15 points were on the Break um but now we're starting to see it here in the third monk now eight-footer cash money monk now with seven back on the odd number here Kings up by one and JJ reick wants a timeout we got a tight one especially at Golden One Center all right here come the Lakers here LeBron sitting on 23 finds Davis guarded by Trey Lyles Davis on the Fall Away nice job by by Tre L he played him tough it's just the size advantage that Davis has to be able to rise up over the top that was a difficult Falling Away shot to knock down however sabonis with the hard screen to rozan three ball yes sir P's eye De'Aaron is in double figures now and he has really really had to work for it too I mean they have not made it easy for him offensively LeBron looking to answer back nice gang rebound there by the Kings three kings trying to box out Rui Hachimura and come up with a stop no call there the sabonis hit the deck meanwhile Lakers got numbers five on four chrisy corner three kings Dodge one right there yeah Malik playing two and Max Christie from the corner real short comes up with a rebound doas now has to spray it out Malik wow deep three grazes the front rim neither team clicking from triple range as LeBron gets away with a push Trey Lyles got his hand on and LeBron complains here come the Kings now they got numbers here four on three Zak got away with one on that last one oh man LeBron was cherry picking then got back into play came away with the Steal hamur Corner triple and that's the 63 made tonight and Mike Brown is going to take a timeout as La goes back up by one switch back to a manto man oh monk finding a bonus on the they did a good job picking that one apart right there nice job and yeah I don't I think the recognition is not that it was necessarily his own it's just how the king started up offensively looked like it might have been with another double double is 25th as Davis with the push shot he's starting to heat up now Katie yeah just his his second bucket of the game but you know obviously to hit him back to back when you look at what he's averaging this season you got to believe that he's going to be able to get himself going Scramble for the ball Davis comes up with it and they're going to get Malik Malik and Domantas that's Malik third personal here second team [Applause] [Music] foul Reaves they're looking for Davis on the switch instead Reaves trying to get into his bag little floater H her with the rebound here come to Kings looking to push with Pace here is Keon Ellis oh nice SP oh what a play thas that is nice Court Vision by Domantas sabonis and if you're Kevin Huerter you know that anytime he's got the ball in his hand you better be looking for that ball Huerter with seven Russell meanwhile big game Off the Bench he's got 16 yeah he I mean two Lakers in double figures and 23 for LeBron and then Russell 16 Malik Phils he got fouled on that last shot tough shooting knife from Malik here's Davis now oh Keon Ellis picked his pocket clean here come to Kings three on two Ellis hanging what he want to do Domantas staying with it count it and one for Domantas another monster game unable to cash in on a three-point play but he's got 12 points 15 rebounds yes to go along with four assists yeah just you know his 25th triple double of the Season moving into seventh in sole possession of seventh all time in Kings history Reaves meanwhile laces one yeah and this is what you you kind of want to try to avoid that's the first triple in six attempts for Austin Reaves you don't want to let them get any kind of a flow or confidence here short on the push LeBron set to check in next whistle so it's Trey Lyles that Baseline shot from about the the 5 foot range to the 10 foot range is like the hardest shot in basketball in my opinion why why is that it's depth perception it's it's such a difficult shot Russell sabonis now the grab and go Kings trailing by two as Reaves gives the foul that'll be Austin Reaves just from 17 water he's just been impeccable tonight 23 points nine of 10 from the field one miss shot this entire game 90% from the field ties it up at [Applause] 74 James backs out Jones Isaac in a defensive stance but LeBron finds a d just great pass right there nice exec by the Lakers that is a tough tough play to defend undersized on the floor right now are the Kings James now with six assists two-point Lakers lead D'Angelo Russell whistle put a reach in selected with the three T I was going to say just one three-point attempts tonight he made it of course and you know we've seen a high high volume from him this season but you know when you see him get in the paint who can stop look at Trey Lyles getting up high for that rebound Fox using that screen he throws it away that'll be the 13th turnover tonight one of Katie's keys to the game and the locomotive known as LeBron barrowing down the lane Vincent answers with a three ball vinon just shooting the three ball really well in the last last game against the Kings just on Thursday and tonight two of three shot clock at eight King's got a two for one opportunity here oh man tiar Fox I mean that was deep right there that was that's the kind of night he's having shooting the ball Fox with 26 he's only missed one shot we got a 6sec differential here between the clocks ly stays with LeBron [Music] here James takes the bump and they're going to give him free throws here they're going to FW here in a moment so great defense on him in the third quarter he really was all of their offense in the first half LeBron James makes the free throws shot clock is off oh Fox oh my gosh De'Aaron Fox weaving bobbing but De'Aaron fox has answered with 26 of his own James now lacing one he's got 27 y too easy just a simple screen right there from LeBron and he turns and has a jumper you got to be up on that Lyles three ball bang yes sir some versatility in terms of small going small ball James starting to feel it though here in the fourth back to back buckets for LeBron James and his first three yeah that is only his second field goal here in the second half and both of them comeing to start this quarter meanwhile Keon Ellis man that one was down and then came back out Second Chance opportunity for Sacramento however W oh man Blue by reddish LS as James comes down with the rebound his [Applause] seventh Russell meanwhile and and Keon turned to Mike Brown immediately it's right the shooter has allowed a legal release the defender commits incidental Hand toand high five contact that would be de incidental immaterial to the play they able to knock down a jumper but they got to limit their turnovers here in this fourth quarter couldn't agree with you more about the turnovers but they're also going to have to figure out how to slow down LeBron James what have you seen from the Kings defensively in terms of what they might need to adjust to slow him down here in the fourth honestly I think as Tre was unable to cash in what about that I couldn't agree with her more and one of the things that I have noticed that Luke CLS does um with his defensive game plans is he'll will play uh some St players 3/4s kind of the same way and then he switches it up in the fourth so you got to wonder but you you have to show bodies to him there's been a lot of single coverage tonight murder oh Zone number red velvet now with nine okay Kev okay fourpoint game yep that's one of those I had meant to do that moment I had meant to do that yes yes 20 points for the bench for Sacramento 22 for the Lakers most of them by this guy right here as we got a foul on the floor says Rodney M doesn't have pictures the box score doesn't have pictures Katie it doesn't have pictures hey you got to be able to to kind of ride with it flow with it improvise right yeah improvise for sure box picked off by cam reddish reddish oh he got away with a carry no call instead they're going to give him the bucket and the foul cam reddish reddish is maybe it found a home I mean he's bounced around the league he's bounced around the league and you know he's trying to fit in here and I'm not sure how solid his minutes are his he listen to me he was a very capable offensive player it was just about finding a Groove and finding a coach and a and a team that had some confidence they're not really looking at him for anything offensively here it's all defense oriented here's Derozan now working on Davis Keegan Murray remember he has those four fouls but he also has two triples he's in double back to a four-point [Applause] game here's LeBron at 39 years old has 30 points Davis now guarded by Murray bring the help on the dribble and here comes Derozan now Kings trailing by for Derozan falling firing and hitting done better against this Lakers team than when it's coming in the half court cuz they have more time to set up that wall send an extra body it's golden one Center Crow trying to implore their team to a win here's LeBron four on the clock side step three ball and look at Keegan battling Anthony Davis who comes up with the offensive rebound oh man gon Fox leading away right now he's getting a break a breather here as Domantas with Davis all on him goes to the strong hand uses the nice up fake and able to get back to that left side use the rim to help negate Anthony Davis shot blocking tied at 89 here's cam reddish they're going to get Derozan for the foul as reddish of rebound tonight for this Lakers Squad obviously Second Chance points two days ago just was a huge factor in the is in the win over the Kings they had 18 Second Chance points the other night tonight the Lakers with nine Huerter trying to get into double figures oh that looks good too right from the release Kevin Huerter unable to cash in two-point Lakers lead Kevin's had some big shots against this Lakers team and that that helps in moments like this oh somehow Russell gets all the way to the rim and Mike Brown is going to take a quick time was a 330 Mark of the of the second quarter since then there's been 16 uh lead changes and four ties so it's going back and back every possession is going to matter he wanted to correct some things oh Hachimura with the volleyball Spike from The Backs side slotted that King shooting 44% from the field Lakers 50% aimore on the dribble Drive strong move wow tough tough play right there the roen races back down oh nice sp there by Fox to sabonis that was really fox has done a great job tonight of finding Domantas and really quick decisions down low when he has an advantage able to finish that one barely Anthony Davis was flying in Domantas 16 and 17 Fox seven [Applause] assists Reaves on the show and go oh little righty floater that's a little Scoopy right there a little scoop shot from Reaves that is a tough tough shot but perfectly used in that situation let see if the Kings can answer back they swing the ball around Derozan on the dribble Drive Murray three ball short goas battling for it trying to keep it alive you got to get a stop here Kyle I mean you got to get a stop here you want to keep it within a reasonable distance and in this little run that the Lakers are on six-point Lakers lead Reaves hitting the deck Davis going to his strong hand rolls out all right Lakers got uh King's got numbers here five on four cuz Davis is in the front row Murray it rims [Applause] out yeah and Anthony Davis is still on the Baseline and kind of coming up limping a little bit things need to stop here down by six Russell straight away as sabonis carouses 183 rebound King's getting good looks they just can't yeah they on nice truly struggling you know uh Keegan is two of seven Malik one of seven Kevin one of s it is just not been a good shooting night from Beyond The Ark there's another offensive rebound the eighth for the Lakers so they get an fresh shot clock which is now at four James foul line jumper 32 now for LeBron move that ball from side to side made that King's defense really have to rotate end up with a really high percentage jumper for LeBron in the paint Lakers on a 10-2 run here Fox thought about it shot clock down to six for mon Fox got to get it up three monk top of the key three you talked about our Shooters Malik monk now one of eight from three yeah and it's just across the board and listen the the shooting from Beyond The Arc for the Lakers is really no better they've struggled as well they're just doing a better job of executing in that mid-range right on Q exactly like you said 10-point ball game ties the largest lead of the game for the Lakers and Mike called that timeout he was trying it was a four-point game three or four-point game at that point really trying trying to to stop the leading and De’Aaron fox trying to elevate and answer back and he's had to do that time and time again tonight will there be enough time in this one to even come out with this or Force overtime got to get a stop right here back to LeBron playing a two-man game with [Applause] Russell LeBron catch his shoot all right you got to stop now you need to score [Music] Fox going to his strong hand to float game on point De'Aaron Fox with a 31 piece just making things happen tonight under two to play now you feeling a sense of urgency here for Sacramento but it has to come down to stops on this end cannot trade buckets at this point Mal with the steal oh let's see what they call here is that going to be he hadn't gain possession possession yeah oh De'Aaron was looking for the big [Applause] shot 90 seconds to play here Reaves on the fire as hamur left wide open Kings Dodge one two possession ball game as Derozan
