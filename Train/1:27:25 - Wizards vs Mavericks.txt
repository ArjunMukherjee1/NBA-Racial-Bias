offensive output for Jordan Poole will it was met with the defensive output as well too a career high six steals for Poole and a lot of this is a collaborative effort between the coaching staff and Poole and this is something that ke has talked about challenging Poole consistently this season when I spoke to this morning after shoot around he told me it's a mix of his anticipation skills and the coaches putting him in a position to use those instincts along with his vision and quickness not always being on an offensive guy that will have a high output so he can sit in the hunter spot and be able to get out in transition and move the break Megan thank you it's time now for our over and under is presented by fan duel total Point score for tonight's game has been set at 231 and a half

Mavericks Mavericks win the opening tip we're underway Gafford wins it over Sarr that's the matchup I'll be focused on tonight seeing how these two B go at one another Kyrie Irving throwing it upstairs to the landlord who misses that lob attempt as the Wizards Will Come Away with the basketball tonight's officials Josh TI crew chief in his 15th season Luca dagger in his seventh and Inon Wong his second season officiating in the league K on a crossover kicking it out to Sarr Corner three rebounded by Kyrie Irving as Mavericks team comes in 24 and 22 13 and 10 here at home meanwhile the Wizards are 6 and 38 1 and 20 away from Capital La Arena they call him the captain Klay Thompson in the corner well already has the guy do not want to get hot early on great Thompson knocking down his first three-point attempt the Mavericks leave the overall series between these two teams 49-37 meanwhile they won in DC back on December the 5th 137 to 101 Gafford collects the rebound Mavericks lost to the Celtics in their last game 122 to 10 seven Washington was competitive in their loss to the Suns 119 to 109 as we talked about in the open it was good to see K and Poole both combined to have dueling double doubles the former wizard Spencer Dinwiddie inside 3 seconds on the shot clock guarded by Kyshawn George oh and beats the shot clock that is tough right there know he to live with the Klay Thompson three-point shot the last possession but right there just a step back isolation play by Spencer Wendy then with Coulibaly two dribbles nice decision finding Sarr who was being guarded by Kyrie fact he was front he was front covered difference on that play Just Patient First points of the night for Washington you see the inactives there for the Mavericks again short-handed still have some All-Star players out there in their lineup too much space there's one of them right there playay Thompson yeah right there Jordan Poole got caught going under play with five points he only had six Saturday and that lost to Boston sawar inside ball goes on the top and then goes in but it's going to be Maverick's possession yeah you're Alex Sarr you look look at this a little bit more smaller on you put it up early 9-2 start here for the Dallas Mavericks shooting 60% to start didn't really wanted GA set a screen does that to free up Thompson again being guarded by his former Golden State teammate much better defense by Jordan Poole taking away that airace five on the shot clock Dinwiddie over to Thompson another three this off first Miss three of the game for Dallas they made their first three laal Flo Off the Mark rebound by PJ Washington Washington playing some of his best basketball as a member of the Mavericks had a c High 19 rebounds and their win over OKC earlier this week Washington excellent defense there by Kyshawn but Washington follows through solid job to the last second these guys are making some tough shots now Poole spraying it over now to George Kyshawn driving inside that was blocked by Washington come to Mavericks they've got numbers a look ahead to Gaffrey who collects and scores good timeout Mavericks already open up in this first quarter 13-2 lead Brian Keith wants to talk about it one when the team takes on the Toronto Raptors at 700 p.m. first 10,000 fans in attendance will receive a Wizards tumbler courtesy of Capital One grab your crew and grab your tickets now at washingtonwizards.com the Mavericks have almost made more field goals than the Wizards have attempted as they have an 11-point lead here Second Chance points already Dallas 5 Washington nothing it's time now for our keys to the game brought to you by your local Washington GMC dealers here now is Drews clu usually with teams that guard the three ball will Dallas in particular top 10 in the league great ball movement and that extra pass will hurt them every time and in kosma and Poole can you have a part two of what you saw in Phoenix both of those guys were phenomenal offensively clicking together seeing the chemistry and when you got those two guys scoring the ball at that high eclipse you you'll catch yourself in games in the fourth quarter see how Washington comes out of that timeout mid-range Jumper by Jordan Poole misses that one rebound by Thompson Kyrie being guarded by Jordan Poole now Kyrie inside misses Sarr gets the rebound might have Po Gafford in the face Wizards have numbers here throw it up Jordan Poole ranging out for three Jordan PS first shot attempt actually second now this is one for eight from the field to start Gafford trying to post up his former teammate goes inside and a kick out for PJ Washington driving left Duncan on S DJ Washington was not familiar with your bounce L 40 minutes against the Seas Saturday the Mavericks are 19-9 when he scores 10 points or more run is 10 for Dallas the last 246 Kyshawn ends that run with the triple that was pretty deep they came from the American Airlines logo Kyshawn coming off his first start against Phoenix that was last time he did that was January 8th at Philly tonight's his 10th NBA start Thompson now three of four to start the game leads all scores right now with eight that's a guy Drew you don't want to see get hot especially from distance doesn't need a lot of dribbles Gafford with the block J W push ahead Thompson all alone prompting another early timeout for Brian Keith his second already here in the first quarter meanwhile Kyshawn George getting in the first three to go down tonight I mean this is a Range Rover Ean George showing the extended range I mean even caught Spencer Dinwiddie by surprise not knowing a young fell can pull from that distance fan has seven games this season where he has three or more threes that's tied for fifth among rookies see the numbers he put up Saturday against Phoenix meanwhile Klay Thompson has been the guy in this game so far four five from three he's got 12 points he had 12 points actually had 11 points against the Wizards back in December only had six last game so this is uh already an outburst for Klay th for scoring the ball but we know he can get going early especially if he gets space from distance historically the W's three is off PJ Washington goes upstairs for that rebound Washington two of 11 from the field so far we just got to get a stop on defense Thompson now on the drive and kick DJ head fake over to Dinwiddie back to Thompson Thompson is the one guy in this gym you can't leave open yeah there no help responsibilities right now you have started a forest line now you got to put it out there's Sarr getting a two and he's down on the floor look like he might have rolled his ankle krie shot was blocked by Coulibaly but going to call a foul on BL good to see Alex back on his feet yeah it is you know trying to get a scouting rep part his first year guys some guys will go down right here and won't be able to return but Alex sarr you can see holding his left ankle and does not want to come out the game so trying to tough it out and I like that yeah sometime you have to be smart and swallow your pride Kyrie Irving is been the star for the Mavericks since Luka Doncic went out Christmas Day against Minnesota and since then Drew since December 26 he's averaging 27 points per game play I mean that's just too much space this this is the hottest man in the state of Texas right now and he's wide open in the corner I mean this is a guy again we've seen him in playoffs where he takes what three dribbles and he's got like 40 so you have to understand your person this this is a this is a lesson for this young team where playay Thompson is going to go to the Hall of Fame yeah you can't just leave him wide open he had 60 with 11 dribbles there you go so that's telling me all Air space I mean if he get an inch a day line is going up no help responsibilities if you guarding Klay Thompson tonight Carrington slipped still was able to pass the ball to Coulibaly swinging it back to balog this time he steps into a triple there's another rebound by Washington as Jonas Valanciunas and Corey Kispert into the game along with bub Carrington Klay again as Carrington goes under the screen Klay Thompson already with 18 points on six of seven from downtown Chris I've been here before last game of a road trip legs feel like you got cement shoes on and right here you cannot go under you in fact you might want to start double teaming and blitzing and jumping the ball once he comes off at any picks any flare strings any pin Downs Drew this is where I want to see an adjustment defensively for Washington right here what do you do against Klay Thompson don't leave him Washington now driving getting into the mid-range misses rebound by Valanciunas Olivier Maxence Prosper coming off of trying to defend Kispert here as he's inside before he tried to bounce pass to Valanciunas and it was last Touch by the wizard so that'll be Mavericks basketball listen nothing matters right now if you're balow Coulibaly you need to be looking at the eyes of Klay Thompson looking at his jersey number guarding time yeah it's face guard time and this is how it's supposed to look here's Klay again oh my God he still got a free look but that's Jason kid that is he is strategically running these quick action flares reicks to create space to play Coulibaly inside and we'll stay here as that's going to be a loose ball foul Jason kid is arguably one of the top point guards of all time Drew that's old school basketball something that you and I have talked about where something is going go right back to it yeah and and you don't think Jason kid knows that type of point guard he was I played here with Jason kid and dirt nitzki and whoever had the hot hand major majority of the time it was dirt he made a concerted effort to get that ball to him a play call every time he didn't need Rick Carlile O A much needed three for Washington to get them in double figures as a team it's now 2810 Mavericks 18 of those 28 points belongs to the guy with the basketball now who kicks it over to prosper and now somebody else other than Klay Thompson is hitting the three aers are seven of nine as a team from three he's got eight assists on 11 made field goal so far is going up the defense there by Corey but PJ Washington slips inside and that's the back and forth cat and mouse game that you've got to account for defensively if you're going to double Klay Thompson his other teammates are cutting to the basket oh it's tough right now they have a small lineup all Five Guys on in this lineup for the Mavericks can shoot the ball PJ Washington is the center right now Dinwiddie over to tesler Edwards PJ inside bounce pass to Edwards here's Klay coming off that screen he's hotter than Fish Grease right now there's nothing you can do for Klay Thompson already with 21 points here in the first quarter lead is 25 already Valanciunas with a hand off the Poole Jordan Poole getting inside Jordan Poole with Five Points Thompson shot that air ball might have been a heat chck but there's Dinwiddie who steals the basketball last Touch by Washington Drew let's look at our Toyota League leaders will'll go back to last game for Jordan Poole interesting stat line for the young man eighth time first time since 2017 Steph Curry for a stat line of 19 points 10 assists six steals five three-pointers made Gilbert Arenas actually accomplished that twice with the Wizards back in 2004 and 2007 and what's more impressive as the six steals being able to toss 10 dimes and clips almost at 20 point mark and you saw the company that he was in on that stat but right now I mean the Dallas M that was KY the scary thing is that was Kyrie Irving what first two points he hit one free throw but yes that's his first field goal first field goal Kispert putting it on the deck going off left off glass too nice move there by Corey Kispert wow what I'm saying that's good I mean he was the guy that that was a focal point tonight offensively Quentin Grimes an entry feed to Gafford for the hook shot Daniel Gafford is playing some of his best ball of his career he's on a tear Drew four double doubles over the last six games he's averaging almost 19 and 11 rebounds Dallas Mavericks can't do any wrong offensively also during that stretch he's averaging three blocks here he is trying to guard Valanciunas better offense by Jonas Valanciunas JB's first points of the night he's got two rebounds and two assists in five minutes Kuzma with the rebound 5sec shot clock game clock differential Mavericks can hold for the final shot here in the first quarter Kyrie with the rock being guarded by kozz Irving coming off that Gafford screen swinging it over to prosper another three the Mavericks have hit nine threes in the first quarter shooting 70% RIS from three-point territory well Klay Thompson outscored the Wizards by himself in the first 12 minutes 21-6 as the Mavericks shot a whopping 62% from the field 69 from three Drew what more can we say Klay Thompson has already matched his season high with seven threes and he did in the first four I mean it's been all Klay Thompson you look at these replays the defense I mean some of the he's wide open and that was pretty little covered by Corey Kispert but it's too late once he makes two to three shots I mean he is in his group take a look at our Chevy stats here in the first quarter again what more can you say about the exploits offensively of Klay Thompson 21 on seven of 10 shooting from three-point range so this shot just 32% from the field as they got hit with a three-point barrage in the first 12 minutes Chris Miller Drew good Mega MC PE with you here on the final night of this six-game road trip Washington is trailing 4-16 to start the second Kuzma turns the basketball over Gafford and Irving the lone starters out there with Prosper Grimes and Jaden Hardy meanwhile George Kuzma Ken valunas and pittsbur you're five on the fourth walk Mavericks turned the basketball over that's their first turnover of the night Kyrie Irving taking the reigns with Luka Doncic being out since Christmas yeah 11 and 13 without Luka 5 and 11 since Christmas like you said and it's a team that's teetering right now when you think about it like you know you losing all these players due to injury and you're still waiting on do to come back what type of team do they have talking to my sources uhoh they're they're the they're on the fence if they go a bad streak where they're losing some games and they did be uh under five 100 they will be talking about moving up in the draft I'm just going to leave it at that Carrington with a three-pointer Washington's third of the game cuz then you you got to think about it is it worth the gamble to go try to make the playoff the plan and lose in the first round and and then don't move up in the draft so you have to be strategic Irving with a bounce pass out to hardy hardy step back three bricks that one Ball's on the floor HMA diving for the L lose ball ends up in the hands of Gafford who misses follows his shot and a kick out to Hardy three pure he's a guy his number is called he responds sits there night in Night Out patiently waiting for an opportunity he's another Maverick that when he scores 10 or more they're now 10 and six the Mavericks just knocked down their 10th three of the game already Valanciunas working on Gafford Gafford might have touched that one Kyrie stepping into a three front rims that one look at the effort there by prosper in between four wizards Second Chance opportunities prompting Brian Keef to call time as the Mavericks now largest influence of Baltimore hoopers that you had around you growing up I think of like a Sam casselle oh no I they play a big part as well too like I want to be on the same caliber as players like that like Sam like a like a melow like a will and to do things like that obviously not going to have the scoring capacity as they do right now but I can do it in a lot of other ways and that is not turn the ball over and get my teammate shots that was my conversation with bub and shout out to you Chris Miller for giving me the idea of asking him about the influence with Baltimore hoopers with regards to how well he has taken care of the basketball and he said it to me quite simply he knows that he can make a living from simply not turning the basketball over he has one turnover or less Megan in 13 of the last 16 games and for any of us that's watched Baltimore Hooper play bub is the quintessential Baltimore Hooper especially the point guard possessing the basketball understanding the value of that as Valanciunas gets a second chance opportunity there on the offensive rebound and for bu one thing he did say that I like he says I'm not at that caliber offensively yet he will get there and the next thing up for him is being able to take that ball to the basket and finish but there is a reason why bub Carrington leads all rookies in minutes played is because of the stats you guys just yielded out right there the assist a turnover ratio as of late he is a solid contributor every night and he's a a capable three-point shooter he keeps you honest out there defensively as an opponent and uh he's slow and steady and whenever it doesn't matter how old you are in this league when you're a point guard you don't turn the ball over you get extra reps you get extra possessions and you get that trust and credibility from your coaching staff and Drew as a big I'm sure you will appreciate when he doesn't turn the ball over what does that mean maximum opportunities on the offensive there you go Prosper inside good defense there by KZ on his ground still offense rebound here for Maverick Gafford another one inside count the bucket and the foul the Dallas Mavericks have the same amount of offensive rebounds as the Wizards have total rebounds yeah what you're seeing now with Gafford 218 games as a wizard he shot 70% from the field and on that possession it was a full effect but he's a grown man now Chris you know he is definitely at that level in his Prime with a lot more playing left in his game you think about Derrik Lively out for a while and this is going to be gafford's opportunity once again to start like he did in Washington and those numbers we just showed right there as a wise man would tell me are battle test or you went to school you do the math that's right you see Dereck Lively on the bench Kuzma catching shoot following his Miss but gets bumped by prosper that wet spot up speaking of Daniel Gafford you know he said a career-high with 31 points last Monday against the Hornets and a season High 15 rebounds and seven blocks came over in that trade with the Mavericks got us ran Holmes in a 2024 first round draft pitch tering trying to work a little two-man game as he was fouled too much little too physical there by Quentin bry right now Bob carington looks like the only one with energy in this game on both sides of the ball and I'm curious to know how do you see that from a former player perspective what is it about what he's doing that shows you is the poing competing get inside the the ball whatever has been talked about in the time outs in the Huddle coach Keith is burned multiple timeouts he is coming up with that assignment and applying that in real time a hook shot for Valanciunas now with six points in 9 minutes Mar on a spray ey CR putting it on the spinning oh no I don't know I don't they getting on ke Tim saying he got hit in the face but was on George because bug played excellent defense right here let's take a look at it I mean cuts the middle off squares him up then he puts his hands up at the last second on the wall that is textbook defense by your rookie point guard Olivier Maxence Prosper went scoreless Saturday against the Seas he was born in Montreal Quebec great two years at uh Market well you were literally there for 5 minutes and left for great reason I've been there before good reasons great reasons I've been there in the past before great City I think we had dinner you woke up the next morning and had to get a quick flight man they was looking at me crazy in customs they said oh you going to be here 4 days Mr Good what what's going on why you sweating you would have told us why I thought I was a Smuggler now oh my son was born Atlas Atlas my third third one had to get back home to Mama right inside couple head fakes loses the basketball Josh T says it was last Touch by George now now you having all those kids you forget some of the names sometimes when you're or or mix up the names because I'm I'm starting to do that with my younger one I'm calling him oldest I'm calling him Andrew sometimes his name is atas well sometimes I call them by a number and when I do that they know they messed up because you so who's eight you know who's eight you know who's one does eight cost the most or one cost the most one cost the least now cuz he got a job oh okay okay he's he's OG now shout out Mick there you goer was a good shot there by caring but Prosper head of the Wizards defense slams it home if the Mavericks are getting anything they want right now in terms of shooting threes getting inside the paint they're 11 of 19 from three 20 of 37 from the field overall tough drive there by Kyle Kuzma Hardy 60% from three-point territory that's the 12th three-point for the Mavericks they can't do any wrong here in this first half Edge sports venues and in venue fan experiences shaping the future of the industry you can stream inside the industry anytime on the Monumental Plus app Washington Wizards are in Jeopardy of being a part of History the Mavericks record for threes and a half are 15 they've done that three times so far in their long history right now they're 12 of 20 going to start on the defensive end right now wizard are struggling and knock down shots but you can't give it back Drew it's been a cornucopia of offense for them not only threes but they've assisted on 17 of their 21 made field goals and you can make it 18 of 22 with the slam from PJ Washington the Mavericks have scored 60 and we still have six minutes to go here in the second quarter Alex Sarr good side to see him back into the game after twisting that ankle rebound there by Quentin Grimes Patrick Baldwin Jr giving some first half Run for the Wizards as he watches Washington hit another three now they're 13 two away from matching their franchise record for threes and a half Poole tiptoe in the Baseline losing the hand mavic's On The Run Prosper bed by Poole right there b k he has to keep his confidence shooting the ball thought he turned down a three-point look and went to penetrate and it was just a wall with Dallas Mavericks Defenders right there waiting for him and now these turnovers it puts added pressure on you on the other end you already opened up the floodgates on the threes don't open up the flood gates in transition with fast break points this Mavericks team came in 10th in the league in three-point shooting at 37% and again if you're just joining us Klay Thompson was the party starter tonight as you see LCA Doncic out for another game suffer that injury against the C injury Minnesota Timberwolves on Christmas day tell you what those calf injuries if you look around the league guys have been dealing with that in and out of lineups the entire season Aaron Gordon Luka Co spraying it over to Coulibaly and he get stays confident like you said Drew in that shot you got to shoot it right now don't even look at the score cuz if you look up it ain't going to be pretty so right now stay confident in your abilities shoot the ball Wall's first field goal of the game starts with multiple stops here yeah and playing the possession in front of you Dinwiddie three on the shot clock getting passali coming over on the weak side Wizards On The Run Patrick Baldwin Jr upstairs to Sarr good decision bow scores as the Wizards had three men under the paint still waiting for the Mavericks to get back on defense and see bow knocks down a three comes down blocks a shot and is rewarded again on the other end with a easy d good DME by saw here's where the Wizards have to stay disciplined defensively cave Thompson is back into the game PJ over saw wow I mean DJ Washington is playing multiple positions for the Maverick whether it's small for or power for to Center nice drive there by Jordan Poole Co with seven yourself Jordan PJ now trying to get entry feed being guarded by Kispert cor staying physical with him there a stop for the wizard s with a rebound and push Jordan Poole says I'm going to shoot this one offensive rebound by Alex right back at him that was contact huh turn around Fall Away Ball's tapped around into the hands of Washington on the three and a half to go Prosper running the floor I don't know how many dunks there have been so far in this game but it is no resistance at The Rim Brian Keef is going to bring in Richuan Holmes and Kyle Kuzma play Thompson misses that one Richuan Holmes he's a guy the last time we saw him was against the Sixers where he had 11 rebounds I think what Brian Keef is looking for some energy and some physicality down low didn't wit he on a cut Klay Thompson what can't he do tonight yeah it goes with bow trying to not let him catch on the top block BJ inside misses r Washington losing the handle lips out he is human got the switch now being guarded by Thompson play with some active hands he'll stay with Washington on seven on the shot clock right here balow coming strong side to block that shot and he runs the floor Alex saw a great job of just catching the ball coming down and that's probably the easy easiest two points bow has had in a long time you know Drew this is a classic case of staying ready you never know when your numb is going to be called ran Holmes is coming into the game he was acquired from the Mavericks again with that first round pick for Daniel Gafford back on February the e8th of last year and hit they are going against one another Kispert on a catch and shoot was fouled by Irving and Corey will go to the free throw line he'll be rewarded with three Corey Kispert knows he has a small window to get activated and you see a lot of teams historically around the league Baseline out of bounds they're going to run that quick pick for a shooter to come off and that's why Corey Kispert was able to come off and get a quick release on on that shot but you'd like would like to see him get going offensively you see Jason kid 347 career victories as a head coach he's in his fourth year with the Mavericks 51 years old from the Bay Oakland California with the St Joe's of alam him and Gary Payton J.R Ryder Antonio Davis those were the guys that I looked up to growing up in the Bay Area area as a kid man it was a dream I felt like I was in a dream when we were finally teammates here in Dallas I was like is this real those three free throws with the first opportunities for Washington it's kper catched out all three Kyrie air balls that one as Gafford keeps the ball alive but Kispert going the other way with it and Irving fouls Kispert on the drive so Corey going back to the free throw line what's working in Corey Kispert's favor right now is just being aggressive looking for his shot right here great defense by the Wizards and then Corey Kispert making a concerted effort right at The Rim he actually trying to dunk that Corey is eighth in the NBA in terms of points Off the Bench with 434 and he's 11th in threes Off the Bench with 74 and that's why he has to stay aggressive he got a small window opportunity and he's coming into this game where his team was down already 30 plus points largest lead for the Mavericks in this one was 38 points gford had five points Saturday against the Suns already he has nine off the Wizard's bench 90 seconds to go Gafford loses it Steel by Coulibaly now the defense has gotten a lot better night and day the last four to five possessions Poole driving past Kyrie but blocked by Gafford Mavericks have numbers GFF allow K to blow by and slams it home that's been a sweet spot the entire night bar Fields run straight to the rim if you the Mavericks Poole being double team Washington swinging it over offensive rebound staying with it Holmes had a chance I like opportunities for Washington just missed the point blank shot but I like the energy Washington trying to go one-on-one against Kispert spins off of him and scores CJ Washington now with 15 just an X Factor for this Dallas Mavericks team multitude home set the screen for Jordan Poole ran slams it home off that tap feed by Coulibaly just hustle and then Corey Kispert taking that shot you do anything else with that ball does it lead to a turnover no you got a second chance opportunity Washington misses that'll do it for the first first half half that saw the Dallas Mavericks put up 13 threes against the Washington Wizards seven of them by Klay Thompson who matched his season high of Threes made already in the first half coming up next is wi halftime live presented by MGM National Harvard with West Hall Jason Smith and Grievous Vasquez it's a 30-point Advantage for the Mavericks here in Dallas halftime live coming your way here on Monumental Sports monumental Sports Network's coverage of Wizards basketball is presented by Iron B the Honda don't settle for less visit your local Honda dealer today one more half of basketball before the Wizards head home after this long six game Road Trip Megan is standing by with Wizards assistant coach Brian Randall for our Greenberg and betterman at the half update Brian I'm going to keep it simple for you what adjustments do you want to see in the second half specifically with what you're doing on the defensive end well we've got got to pick up our speed they're they're playing at a different pace than we are um you know until we do that there's not a whole lot we can do to be quite honest we we've got to master their speed we've got to match intensity I think if we do that now we can see if things are going to work but if we keep playing at the pace that we're at it's going to be hard to to to withstand what they've got they're an experienced team so we got to pick the pace up appreciate your time good luck in the second half thanks first possession to start the third quarter the Wizards turn the basketball over leading to Gafford slam and the foul I me already game has gotten out of hand the open up this third quarter can't be this easy don't want to force Daniel Gafford right there that's that's just a pure wrapup make him earn at the foul line but you know what he can do in that restricted area career 70% field goal percentage Daniel Gafford in that first half had nine points seven rebounds six of them were on the offensive Glass three blocks and he gets the scoring started here in the third quarter we told you y Valanciunas was in the game to start that's because Alex Sarr  listed as questionable dealing with a sprained ankle keep you posted on that as this Wizards team is not coming out with the right disposition here in the third quarter at this point it's about your pride Drew I think in a game like this but also you know this is going to touch the character last game six game Road Trip test you out as an in individual but it's a team Irving being heavily guarded there by George and still scores he is a wizard with the basketball speci Dinwiddie just comes over in the passing Lane and gets the steal Washington layup another and one the Mavericks are trying to put a nail in this one early in the third quarter that's been the other cheat Go cheat COD tonight besides Klay Thompson and Daniel Gafford PJ Washington has been The X Factor playing multiple position especially in that small lineup where he's the five but taking a left to right crossover on Valanciunas going to the rack initiating the contact and one DJ Washington came over last season along with Daniel Gafford where they really got an uptick with those two veterans joining Kyrie and along with the rookie Dereck Lively at the time Kuzma with a veteran move I've been waiting for Kyle Kuzma to not only utilize this pump fake but watch what he does the last second he gets Daniel Gafford in air and then he searches for the contact gets it and one I mean he isolation plays on that punk fake is has been key he gets a lot of guys off their feet in the air next thing is not shying away from the contact but going through with contact Kyle Kuzma now two of eight from the field he's got five points got three personal fouls have to be judicious with those Klay Thompson off a curl and I hate to say this Drew he's been relatively quiet since that first quarter don't say it too loud I'm want to get him started kozz good footwork kicking it over to George and it'll stay with Washington 14 on the shot clock but you see he did he got a guy up in the air again Kyrie Irving even went for the pump fake Poole signaling the play for Washington as he's going to inbound the basketball Chum is handing back to Jordan Poole Jordan Poole nice little St sto there getting Washington off his feet yeah they call that the dill now when you attack the basket and you just stop on a dime it throws the timing of the defense especially if the recovering watch PJ Washington I love that move and you know who uh utilizes that the most he's not active tonight Luka Don Master you put a master class on you with that Jordan Poole slips shot clock at five kicking it over to M Jonas Valanciunas underneath as he was bodied by Dinwiddie Valanciunas showing some physicality down low be the Maverick's third team foul slow and steady Wizards team will try to get back into this one to make it competitive Kyle nice pocket pass inside to Valanciunas hook shot over Gafford Wizards are shooting now 18 of 54 33% Jordan Poole long three with the hand off as Kyshawn is trying to stay attached Washington's weak side defense might have got exposed but Washington misses the three right there they had Daniel Gafford at the rim for Kuzma at the emergency switch to leave Washington open in the corner now to Coulibaly step through shot there off of Dinwiddie Taps it over to Thompson Mavericks team in this third quarter Ryden with their starters as play loses the handle there's only so much defense you can play in this league eventually the game calls for shots to be made and right now the Wizards shooting 32% from the field and 18 from three that was just Dallas's third turnover of the game relatively clean for them Kyshawn misses Kyle doesn't you have to be aggressive I love it take by Kyshawn George forcing Klay Thompson to play some defense you know he can play offense three wizard starters are scored seven points leading score for Washington has been Kispert off the bench with nine Gafford two on the rim yeah here a simple pick roll to the basket kick slip with PJ Washington top block Klay Thompson he runs right to the rim 14 points seven rebounds three assists and three blocks for the landlord Daniel Gafford second personal called on balunis it's offensive foul it's coming right back to you so you going to have to be careful if they're going to run this horns action with Gafford sing the pick and Thompson turns it over Jordan Poole left hand layup on Dinwiddie play it out 8250 Mavericks 730 to go here in the quarter PJ Washington one onone against KZ and Josh 's going to call an offensive foul on Washington awkward Fall by both guys yeah well watch how kind of sets PJ Washington up after the first initial bump PJ gives him the space and then he takes the fall could probably went either way but got the benefit on that callide action there between Poole and Jonas Valanciunas kzz no looking inside Gafford with another block his fourth Dinwiddie now inside too easy Daniel Gafford now with 16 I told you in the first half Daniel Gafford has been on a tear last six games averaging almost 19 points and 11 rebounds just amazing of the development of Daniel Gafford and where he is this point of his career right here that a block shot and he runs the floor to give reward on other end time out on the floor with 651 to go 8450 to are you kidding wow Here Comes Jordan Poole on the Run throwing it upstairs oh whoa I don't think people in Phoenix realize what they just saw all right wizard fans tell me if You' heard this before Chris and Drew arguing about something we actually debating which one of those dunks was tops for Bal Coulibaly this year Hey listen almost carving copy but on that left one if you really freeze it he got up a little higher so I'm going with the one in against Charlotte I'm going to go with the one in Phoenix of course you are but we always you just want to argue that I got some I got some Intel so before the game I talked to balal and I asked him I said what has been your favorite dunk of the year and he said oh Phoenix by far did you see the left one right there I did over the Box on that I did not going to argue with you I I just asked a man that did it I don't remember so young also he caught a body in the game I thought it was a better dunk than the lot he sure did that's what's next on his menu I think is starting to get some body work handing out facials like an esthetician you already know it a whistle there on PJ Washington we've got an update on the status of Alex we told you with that left ankle sprain he will not return now so it'll be interesting to see what Brian Keef does final 617 third quarter and into the fourth will he play you know Anthony Gil will ran Holmes get an opportunity here uh to get some minutes yeah well when Daniel Gafford goes out the game DJ Washington has been your Center so if you're Brian Keith you might want to look to go small Coulibaly on a catch and shoot gets that one to go down the all second three of the night he's in double figures now leading the Wizards in scoring with 10 Washington now five of 23 from downtown Kyrie upstairs to Gafford eff for two rebound shy of a double double it's Carrington all alone mid-range nice jumper the smooth Carrington we told you about his assist to turnover ratio here lately heard the conversation with him and Megan about the value of being a Baltimore point guard and taking care of the Rock and doing a solid job defensively tonight on Kyrie Irv low key for more on Bob Carrington facing Kyrie Irving round two let's check in with Megan yeah I asked him as part of that conversation if when he faces you know Stellar point guards like a guy like Kyrie do you take things away from their game that you want to try and Implement and he laughed and without question said I am a thief for sure I'll take anything that I can try to do to get better with my game also creating an imaginary battle within his mind that Kyrie talk smack about him even though he did he said oh what was that kye you said about me okay I got you my guy so it's just it's interesting to see how he mentally just gets himself up for these types of matchups that's some MJ stuff right there just creating rhetoric I love it I mean OKC against SGA he had him locked down for the little first little quarter you know what I'm saying until SGA was like you know what let me turn it up now young fell but I love from a competitive standpoint he he's up for the challenge and he plays at a a different level with those Stellar matchups and he's elite point guards Kyrie swinging it over to Washington here's Grimes on a catch and shoot Quentin Grimes coming over from the Knicks he a guy that played his college ball in Houston playing for Calvin Samson known as a defensive guy but offensively he's really improved in the NBA yeah when grind is grindy I like it Bach junis and one Jonas Valanciunas now with eight points DJ called for his fourth personal that is PJ Washington's fourth personal foul so decide to come in with Edwards you see Gafford to Coulibaly and a couple of laughs there on the fre throw line there's Valanciunas trying to cash out the three-point opportunity he does just that Yas Valanciunas a veteran last four games almost 15 points shooting 69% from the field nine of 10 from the free throw line Kali with a steal he's got a one-on-one opportunity against Irving bumped and one love the aggressiveness there by belal seeing that he had the smaller Irving backpedaling took full advantage of that getting to the rim bow right here everything offensively that has happened positive for Bala has started on the defensive end him making it play the block the deflection and get an out and running transition Bal making up for that December 5th meeting against the Mavericks where he had five points he was 0 of 10 from the field just one of two games this season he was without a field goal back on January the 1st he went 0 for one against the Bulls before leaving with that illness Holmes guarding Gafford Daniels jumper rattles out try to hit that fall away on ran here's ran inside SL at home that's impressive slamming with purpose no time to warm up going I I was talking to mares Morris before the game he said they're not calling him OG's no more his name is not OG no more it's they're calling him un now Megan called me that two years ago that's embarrassing was it 2 years or was it long long it was like 3 years ago maybe she said hey what's up so now if that's what they're calling them today I must have been really old three years ago just slid through the Honda Drive of the game I see you rashan all right Megan I see what's going Onan might not be old enough to call Un yet come on now how is ran Holmes ran Holmes is 31 years old get in there he's

the Mavericks are now 15 of 30 as the Wizards come back and score putting some Pace to the game rattles out that one lizard in the bonus for the final 238 Jordan Poole with a jab step Kispert deep

pull up good screen by Holmes bringing up Jordan Poole Jordan following his Miss 90 seconds to go good flare screen by ran Holmes doing those little things Coulibaly inside fouled by Marquee great clear screen by Richuan Holmes kind of making something out of nothing allow Coulibaly to attack that operation in Afghanistan and also Iraq on behalf of all of us here Monumental sports and entertainment want to thank Marine Core Colonel Dave Lapin for his service here in the third quarter Kyrie Irving has scored 10 of his 13 Coulibaly leading the Wizards in scoring with 15 you're just joining us it was all Mavericks in that first quarter led by as many is 38 L by Klay Thompson who ties the franchise record with three-pointers made in a quarter with seven he tied Luka who did it against the Clippers back in February of 2022 I mean if you take out that first quarter to 42-6 I mean the Wizards it's been competitive the last two second quarter was what 3127 Mavericks that was a four-point deficit and in the third quarter Wizards actually won that quarter by two that 4216 I mean you dug a hole a tunnel exactly Kyrie working inside grabes to prosper Prosper beautiful reverse layup ack Chris Olivier Maxence Prosper s plays for Notre Bame and they're trying to be the first WNBA NBA brother sister tandem that's going to be a Miss down there just what activity and want to

our game recap gal Coulibaly 16 and5 Gafford 18 points five blocks also he's got eight rebounds and the fast break opportunities Advantage Dallas plus 10 fourth quarter underway Chris Miller Drew good meic peek with you here on Monumental Sports Network It's the final game of six on the road the Wizards will head home have a day off and they get ready for a back-to-back against Toronto and the Lakers Jaden Hardy turning the basketball over to start the quarter Wizards going with Kyshawn George Carrington Kispert Holmes and Champagnie t on the shot clock M Corey on the drrive Kesler Edwards to Hardy DW he takes a couple dribbles back shot clock now at five Hardy step back jumper rattles in Jen Hardy now with eight points off the Maverick's bench Jordan eight straight games with three more threes long as active streak right now in the association Holmes with an offensive rebound and put back I think it's extra incentive for ran Holmes I mean he could not get off the bench here in Dallas Keith Morris misses that three Keith Morris playing that that Drew good and roll now uhoh clapping five man get in the game and as a OG and shoot the ball in the fields like you got a balloon in your hand Caron couple crossovers he'll be rewarded with some free throws nice drive there by Caron going left well taking his time too I like that drive right here Drew this is the next step he gets in the paint now can you finish and I I tell you what if there anything for bug Carrington to work on in the summer two things I want him to continue to watch film and be a student of the game these these match up the Kyrie Irving the SG e all of them all the point guards around the league that you see he gets up for study tape watch them and even if you can try to work out with him in the summertime try to steal some of the recipes but next up for bug is becoming a better finisher he always had he already has that ability to attack the paint get in there in the scene to those gaps but finishing at The Rim which is tough for not only just bub carington but for a lot of 19-year-olds in the world yep see the player comparisons between Gafford and PJ Washington as they're both sitting right now allowing the OG Marie Morris to score he's already figured out the hard part that's being able to stay on the floor be professional and he can knock down that three ke now in his 14th year oh nice drive right there and finish by ran Holmes I think he might have some double motivation tonight Drew playing against his former team and then get some run with his current Dinwiddie he on a driving kick Marquee put a couple pump fakes on the Baseline B was Tapped Out by shamp Penny Carrington lost the handle trying to go for that signature pull up three Hardy waiting for Dinwiddie Spencer veteran mve there by the former wizard more of Megan's conversation earlier today with bub Carrington here is Megan thanks OG you guys were just talking about his his scoring and specifically Drew you were talking about what you want to see him kind of work on in the off season and the last couple of games he's been in double digit scoring excuse me and he said telling me that he's just more comfortable playing at the NBA level he knew it was take some time for him to adjust from college to the NBA obviously being a rookie fluctuating with his minutes knowing that he would get a heavy amount of minutes but wasn't sure starting consistently coming off the bench but a lot of it is putting in the practice putting in the work and just what the coaches want to go through and the game starting to become more and more fluid for him starting to see the successes and the uh fruits of his labor of the work he's been putting it in so he said once you become familiar with all of those things it becomes a little bit easier on you to be able to put the ball in the hoop the way you're used to seeing it go down well you as a former point guard would understand Megan being inquisitive and asking a lot of questions and figuring out where players like this their shots all these things he's learning in real time and I think he's doing an excellent job here he is passing to shamp Penny and hustles to get the basketball and finds Kispert in his spot there's another PG move there by Carrington Kispert now at 15 off the Poole solid performance being aggressive what I like most is him getting to the foul line five times already not just settling for three-point shots Sean George being a little too physical there on Grimes Wizards are well represented in the NBA rookie ladder three are in the top 10 led by Alex Sarr Carrington and kesan this week got into the top 10 we talked about it a couple times where alex sarr has an opportunity to go get the Rookie of the Year

end of my career Chris when I start getting in that champen gets the breakway D hopefully that could get him going that is a tough role to play to sit there not knowing when you're going to go in the game and then you get out there and you catch that live grenade got to put it up Hardy into the body of hovic and scores Jen Hardy with now 10 points off the Maverick's bench Kispert inside fighting with Kesler head fake strong move rebounded by Kyler Kelly just got signed by the Mavericks oh you can already tell he's bouncy here's Grimes W brri has got a lot of opportunities with the Knicks but looks at this is a guy that can come off the bench and really give a spark to Jason kid he had 12 starts this season averaging 14 points and shooting 40% from three he's 50% jhawk I see what you did there okay he got credit he transferred on he got credit tap in there by Tristan Lich getting his points to go down that portal before it was a portal it was just a transfer Hardy call that offensive foul a kick out there by Jaden Hardy see Carrington there still on the floor being helped up by his teammates watch the leg kick yeah so this is where it comes into play why isn't that upgraded to a a flagrant one you know in your ball-headed reasoning this is one of those where I agree with you you agree with me now totally okay if you're going to kick your leg out as an offensive player same thing applies as if the defensive player sticks his leg out not allow you to come down we got remember I brought that up I think the about 3 weeks ago somebody came with a flying knee on a jump shot and he was like that's his jump that's a jump shot that's like normal wind up I'm like no it's not can't by the way our producer ritual said I was talking spicy too he doesn't realize when you say ball hit it reasoning that's a compliment well you know what a lot of ballhead guys in our production team Rich wolf being one of them you Hardy scores you cutting up on the end of this road trip Dre I love you rich 50 paint points from the Mavericks tonight got a little more than five minutes to go in this one some opportunity minutes here for these young Wizards Kesler Edwards going up to Tyler Kelly you said you could just tell by the f I I haven't seen him couldn't Point him out in the lineup you know you literally had to figure out who this guy was before the game but soon as he walked to the score table I told Chris he looks bouncy walking on his toes and he's seven feet he's taller than Gafford by the way young man's from Logan Utah He's a seven-footer not warmed and now as a word from pined I saw I saw his vitals he was the g-league all defensive team in 2024 and he was the g-league blocks leader who does that sound like Daniel Gafford not only that Jay Huff Jay Huff was that guy too Defensive Player of the Year back to back and then having that opportunity in Memphis two-time Pack 12 all defensive team good play speaking of Pack 12 Kessler Edwards hitting a corner three Edwards played his college ball at pepperd one of the prettiest colleges in the country yeah depending on what side of the school you on though water side yeah okay there you go you ever seen the backside Gill's first minutes of Service Oceanside is rning Johnny Davis is a little too physical on Hardy Patrick Baldwin Jr coming back into the game he'll replace BB Carrington solid effort for bub tonight 25 minutes correction the F his first the Brandon Williams undrafted out of Arizona the Inbal Hardy inside the paint rebounded by Tristan Champagnie Tristan inside counted in one opportunity here for vich to get some burn little late in the game good to see get a bucket he going go in gain some confidence having that opportunity tonight good catch way to finish through contact trist Tristan has been dealing with some leg injuries throughout the course of the Season he's played six games so far for Washington before tonight got 13 minutes Rich tonight he's going to hopefully close out this game he's got seven points in four minutes Drew Prosper what a head fake olier Maxence Prosper Mavericks tonight 10 of 15 from the free throw line again the Mavericks had a laundry list of injuries tonight led by Luka Doncic now Dereck Lively Naji Marshall and the list goes on and on but one guy that was healthy and effective especially starting the game with Klay Thompson I did he even score the rest of the game did he score all 23 in that first quarter seven for 12 I know he didn't hit a three hit all all seven of those threes in the first quarter by the way yeah good tied to franchise record with Luka Doncic for most threes in that first quarter Champagnie dime inside Gafford excuse me gil fouled by Kelly y every time on that pump fake I don't care if you're playing why does everyone fall for I don't know I mean even in 2K you get into the pain in 2K pump fake everybody jumping out the out the sneakers and then you spraying out for that three same here in real life this level you get in that paint it's guys playing catchup they're in this recovery mode and in all it takes us one Punk fake two Punk fakes and guys go to jumping now it's time to search the contact as we close out the final 319 in this game Drew what can this team take away from something like this when you get humbled in the first 12 minutes first quarter starts you do not have room for air you want to set the tone as much as possible and giving up 4 two points and only scoring 16 shows me that not only were you not being able to get stops but you couldn't score the ball I mean that is there's not too many teams Al the Wizards that can come back down to 42 to 16 in the first quarter Johnny Davis with a Fall Away Jake going back to prosper he went score warless Saturday against the Celtics and now he's got 17 Off the Bench as the Wizards get a turnover Champagnie misses that one Kelly with the rebound Brandon Williams over to Maxence Prosper give him 20 off the Poole 20th three-pointer made for the Dallas Mavericks I said guys are going to have extra opportunity on that Dallas Mavericks team tonight and he was one of them boser Off the Bench 20 points five rebounds got to the foul line knocked down a couple threes highly active back to Saturday's game for Patrick Baldwin Jr playing for the capital city go go went for a team High 28 he was 6 of 10 from three and 29 minutes so Patrick Baldwin Jr got some good run for the go- go but now he's playing for the parent club with 210 to go West thank you very much got 210 to go here before the Wizards head back home Drew it's been a long road trip Wizards have learned a lot I think just go back to the Golden State game to start this trip the Wizards set a franchise record with 22 threes and then to end this trip they've watched the Dallas Mavericks put 20 threes on their head yeah I mean I've been there before as a player playing in this league for 14 years and these West Coast Road Trips five six game road trips that last one is just tough I mean the odds is just stacked up against you Wizards still have their longest road trip of the season coming in March where I feel like we're going to be out of DC for the entire month it'll feel like talk about back toback games against Toronto they will take on Detroit take on the Nuggets of Utah and Portland and those are two miniseries oh my god oh it still counts it counts counts as a d it sure does champen on the rim you can tell he saw some real estate right there between him and the rim he took advantage of it and bought it at a low rate I don't know about that interest rate right nowr there we go it's coming down a little bit though Brandon Williams three Patrick Baldwin Jr Taps it over to Champagnie 30-point lead for the Dallas Mavericks Lovich know Tristan's not scared any time he gets into the game he's letting it Fly 10 points for Tristan on four of eight shooting 45 5 Seconds to go oh nice see there champ peny coming in to clean it up Johnny Davis the moves this game was all Dallas Mavericks from the start Drew they never trailed their largest lead was 38 in that first half they got 51 points off their bench and their starters were exceptional led by Klay Thompson who had 23 points seven three-pointers in the first quarter that really balloon that lead we got 20 points from Olivier Maxence Prosper Kyrie had 13 Daniel Gafford against his former team goes for 18 and8 three assists and five blocks for Washington got contributions from koua Coulibaly led the way with 16 15 by Poole Kispert had 15 Off the Bench and here in the The Witching Hour of this game Tristan vukovich goes for 10 in 8 minutes Patrick Baldwin Jr splashes a three Washington Wizards will come home falling at 6 and 39 1 and 21 on the road Dallas Mavericks will improve to 25 and 22 14 and 10 at home they are ninth in the Western Conference yeah just tough first quarter start for the Wizards could not get back in this ball game game it's a lopsided deficit 42-6 to start the game and just could not recover good gu Klay Thompson Wizards will have nightmares thinking about the way that that guy got open and free and clear for a lot of the three-pointers he got especially in that first quarter but it was all Mavericks from start to finish final score from American Airlines Center it's the Mavericks 130 the Wizards 108 Monumental Sports
