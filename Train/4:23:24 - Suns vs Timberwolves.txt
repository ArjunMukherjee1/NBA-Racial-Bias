 here in Minneapolis alongside the great Greg Anthony I'm speir oidas we'll hear from Stephanie ready in just a couple of minutes G what a statement win for this upand cominging Minnesota team in game one we know Kevin Durant we know the stars on the other side he played well they didn't get much Beyond him and Phoenix was dominated inside listen both of the superstars showed up and showed out in game one you had to give the edge to Ant-Man he was dynamic in that performance going up against the guy he idolized growing up but you mentioned it SPO the difference was the paint That's where Minnesota dominated this game in game one and Rudy Gobert played a huge role in that you see the 20 second chance points a 24 rebound Edge in that game and keep in mind that Phoenix actually outrebounded Minnesota two of the three games in the regular season so they've got to sh that area up if they want to even things out second most lopsided win for Minnesota in their play playoff franchise history as we take a look at her starting lineups presented by KIA couple of notables GRA now remember he left the game the other night with an ankle tweet good news he is back so we'll keep tabs on how he looks and meantime Kyle Anderson who tweaked his hip GA in game one looked to be potentially a significant injury surprisingly Anderson is available tonight to come off the bench for Chris Finch and Minnesota and that that'll be they have other options obviously they'd love to have him out there but I'm just looking to see if Phoenix can get off to a better start right that's really been the key in this matchup in the regular season and the guy we didn't talk about Devin Booker he has been As Good As It Gets when you talk about postseason performers not up to par in game one one thing Frank Fogle touched on in a conversation with him earlier tonight we have to handle their pressure better as we start to anticipate some of the adjustments that both coaches Greg are going to make here in game two and one way you handle pressure is your ability to move the basketball if you can move that ball and get Minnesota to have to be in rotation I think that creates better opportunities for you to attack our officiating Cru X are with Josh TI dri Taylor alternate is morat kogut and the replay Center Courtney Kirkland and Nick f as we are off and running here in Minneapolis in what is a of white better than 20,000 Durant off Target at the start and the glass controlled by Minnesota Timberwolves 56 wins in what was their best season in 20 years can they take that next step as a postseason team this is Jade McDaniels in the corner on the attack in and out from the high post and it's Tracked Down in the corner by Allen and they had Gobert there at the rim for a l just unable to make the delivery there and Phoenix solid job defensively can Bradley Beal and this guy Devin Booker have better nights they're going to have to if they're going to have a chance in this series as Booker missfires on his first take no doubt those guys are going to have to perform at a high level but they're also going to need an X Factor somebody else on that Phoenix team to step up if they want to even this up car Anthony-towns High degree of difficulty and nkic able to clear underneath here's Booker on the attack and he CS it up one thing to keep in mind Booker got into that early foul trouble the other night picked up three fouls in the first half and that just kind of threw him off the rest of the it'll definitely disrupt your Rhythm but that was an example there of edwards's athleticism how strong he was able to withstand that hit by Booker and not give up ground Mike Conley Junior gets his own first points for Minnesota Booker's going to reset to Allen on a skip interesting Kart Anthony-Towns defending Durant I I like the call listen Durant can toast anybody but with a guy like Towns at 7t and the ability to move laterally you just want to see if you can disrupt the rhythm of the rant here Anthony Edwards 33 points in the series opener he fires and he BS in a triple and you know and everyone raving about how good he was in game one but keep in mind his last five games he's averaging 35 six and six so he has been on a tear McDaniels my goodness trying to rip the roof off this place it'll be on Durant his first how about the fearlessness from Jaden McDaniels he's going to shoot free throws this is an area where it'll become an unfair game if this guy can consistently knock down that triple and there you can see a little bit of contact on the attack by McDaniels in transition G think of how this Minnesota team is different from last year remember they lost in the first round against Denver they didn't make any huge offseason changes but the two guys they were missing in that series Jaden McDaniels this kid at the free throw line and Naz Reid who are such big pieces for them now that has changed the dynamic of this team everyone talks about you know Gobert and and cap but those two have brought something different yeah look they've got star power but if you want to have Championship caliber play you've got to have dep and those two guys in another turnover here BYOB Phoenix those two guys one's going to make all defense the other was in the running and great find there by McDaniels for the dump the other guy in the running for six minutes so that's a lot of fire power to add to this L yes sir don't forget to download the FanDuel Sports app it's got live betting it's got live pars and it pays instantly now Chuck who scores the most points tonight Devin Booker or Anthony Edward I'mma go with Devin Booker in a bounce back all right better watch yourself DC boy you add rubber duckies into that group that's potentially dangerous Kenny and Chuck a word from FanDuel Here Comes Devin Booker Phoenix still looking for their first points just under three minutes gone by Kevin Durant trying to lean in to create the space short and he's missed his first two yeah but that that was the Gobert effect on that possession because Devin Booker had a chance to attack the rim and saw Gobert rot over and decided not to attack Edwards well short Kevin Durant has actually missed his first three shots as Phoenix right now hold for as a team and three turnovers so that that's the issue they you know they have turned the ball over and have not been able to get anything to go and look at the defensive pressure by Minnesota Bradley Beal was six of 10 of the opener underneath shot clock in one Allen has the fire and he rattles it in High degree of difficulty deep in the corner that was a an incredible finish there and again even though they score how about the defense but they forced them to have to take a contested three there so if you're Chris you'd like the start defensively number one defensive rating team are the Timberwolves in the NBA this season as Kart Anthony-Towns is called for a double dribble as's Frank vogle all the the injury issues you trying to incorporate Bradley Beal their big three missed a combined 50 games between the booker miss a chunk of the year and so you had that but also a lack of your prototype point guard has been a challenge for Vogal and sometimes depending upon the matchup in the postseason that can be exploited and this is kind of an example of it here you'd love to be able to play a lot of kicking role with Gobert in it right there to be able to create those opportunities but a great job by go be on the contestant and they can't play that picking role right because they don't have the Prototype point guard go a is fouled on a pass let's see if they get Allen here I believe it will be Grayson Allen that'll be his first and when you talk about that prototype listen Devon Booker Bradley Bill Kevin Durant they can all run a pick and roll but they're not necessarily pick and roll players and by that I mean the pick and roll is not just to get your shot or the pocket pass it's to put the opposing team in rotation and so that's where the ability to make a pass that creates an advantage sometimes is lacking there be an illegal pick on towns so he picks up a personal here at the 732 Mark of the first quarter Chris Finch among the three finalist for the NBA coach of the year award something that this franchise has never had in its history and they may not get it this year greater job as he has done but a tremendous recognition for him nonetheless Booker elevates so not the start he was hoping for after Booker really struggled in the opener at least by his own standards he was five of 16 from the field so we come up on a seven-minute markk Edwards against his Boyhood Idol Kevin Durant they run the second Defender towns deep shot and he misses badly Ricochet is out of bounds it goes back to the Suns yeah I didn't like that shot still about 6 seconds on the shot clock that's one where you kick it to that weak side Maybe get a quick pick and roll or an opportunity to attack remember Karl Anthony-towns the 18 games that he missed the Tor miniscus underw the knee surgery in early March so still trying to get himself back to full form KB beautiful touch pass inside it's nurit and just like that it's a three-point game and they're going to need Nurkic to play Big it doesn't always have to show up statistically but he's got to have more of an impact in the paint on both sides Conley playing pick and roll with go good ball movement into the corner McDaniels a little bit too much rebound nerkish so Minnesota now has cooled off Allen looking to push cops it up another turnover fourth for the Suns look at the Frenchman in the open for he flicks it up his prayer is answered the basket however will not count offensive foul against go he doesn't like it they to challenge they are going to challenge no looking like Mike Conley that's close successful challenge for Chris Finch it is a block against nkic always interesting when you see a coach use that challenge early it is a gamble G I know how you feel about it I'm not not a fan and he wins this call but and I think I do think that is a block but we've seen possessions in this postseason already where it didn't go the way you thought the challenge would and boy that would have been risky to lose that challenge in that scenario so they keep a challenge Rudy Gobert to the free throw line you see what he did in the opener Gobert once again a finalist for a defensive player of the year if he wins it he would become only the Third player in the history of the league to do it four times offensive rebound and more free throws coming up boy McDaniels ripped to the deck and boy again the rebounding the glass looming large for Phoenix and this is where the postseason Kevin Durant just picked up his second yeah that's his second there but they just they don't get bodies on bodies there they've got to do a better job now if you're Frank boo I got to believe you keep him in the game and trust that he can continue to play with two power bnba on TNT is brought to you by the three row Kia sento built for the Unstoppable Kia the official Automotive partner of the NBA so was Devon Booker getting into the foul trouble in game one and tonight it's KB who was really their only consistent source of offense in game one and for the moment both is going to keep Kevin Durant on the flooor Here Comes Beal probing resets to the corner has Gobert on him Beal using that dazzling footwork but he missed and this will be last Touch by Edwards shot clock's going to reset and that's an example of a possession where when you get Gobert out on the perimeter guarding nurkic has got to get to that offensive glass that's a great job there creates another possession for the Suns so Booker plays that pick and roll game with nurkic and he leans up and in over the top of go so nurkic with four of the sun's First Seven Points as we play with five and change left in this opening quarter Booker nearly steel knock out of bounds in front of the Minnesota bench with 16 seconds to shoot if you're Phoenix you got to feel like you can guard those the Timberwolves in the hand so if you can cut down your live ball turnovers and make them play five on five you should feel like you can guard that's a pull up boy beautiful stroke Nickeil Alexander Walker wasting no time and how good was he in the opener 18 points he hit four threes in the first game of the series big part of what they did with their bench Booker flat footed three back rim kept Alive by nage but it's out of bounds and it goes back to the Timberwolves and you see the difference with Rudy Gobert here as opposed to Utah they would never put him in switches where he went out and actually guarded perimeter players up top but he is definitely committed to it and doing a solid job here to start this game Edwards nearly turned it over Naz Reid has checked into the game as well Nickeille Alexander Walker dumps it underneath go be pretty little flick in the reverse half dozen for the Frenchman they're up nine and right now the efficiency level that Minnesota is playing with impressive 55% shooting here at the start Kevin Durant boy buried in the corner almost knew the contact was coming Zach Zara Blows the Whistle and a side out of bounds against Edwards that's his first you still like the competitive Spirit of Anthony Edward there not allowing airace for the rant Royce O'Neal has checked in at the game for Frank Fogle here's Kevin Durant over the top of Naz Reid and first points for Durant yeah and I want to emphasize again how good nurkic has been here early on that was a terrific drivve and kick there to create that opportunity little floater by Alexander Walker Booker looking to push to transition three Booker cleans up his own mess little fake lays it up and in see if that can't get his game going it's on Reid and that's going to be his first so potential three-point play for Devin Booker and despite some poor shooting G they got a chance to cut it to four yeah but that was because they defended well enough and they were able to get out in transition I think that's going to be critical as the game speeds up it makes Minnesota smaller that size becomes less of an impact offensively so Booker complet the tough three-point play it's a four-point game despite the fact that the suns are shooting 35% if you've just joined us they've also turned it over four times so all things considered have to be pleased with where they sit Naz Reid tough contested layup by Durant and Eric Gordon controlling for Phoenix up the floorida Kevin Durant for Durant nearly turned it over under underneath he nearly walked he turns it over nonetheless yeah that was just a good job defensively but now read I tell you I am blown away by Gobert in his commitment to playing in space left-handed bounce underneath McDaniels Gobert dazzling pass by McDaniels Minnesota doing a terrific job with the ball movement here in control early are the timber that's his franchise Hall of Fame player by the end of his career the way he playing up there so if he keep this up he on great Pace to do that let's go let's go come on come on right now he's playing as well as anybody in the league super crafty puts the defender in tough positions me and you let's get to it and you don't stop a goly j you can't say enough good things jayen Brunson with another answer Nick 76ers Thursday on TNT you're calling some people find theirs at an early age others later in life no matter when you find it consider yourself lucky because it becomes your everything our calling was to build trucks and that's why trucks are what we do we put our everything in every truck so that when you find your calling nothing can stop you from answering it you're watching the 2024 NBA playoffs presented by Google pixel Target Center Rockin and Stephanie ready working the sidelines for us here tonight hi Stephanie hey there sh A lot's been made of Anthony Edwards offensive prowess his athleticism and how he can score at will well I talk to him about his defense I asked him earlier what was the moment that he decided to make defense a priority and to take prde in it he said that finchy challenged him a couple of summers ago he's referring to head coach Chris Finch he said that he needed to be a better Defender if they wanted to win Finch told him that he has to play both sides of the ball and a told me that he took on the challenge in the summertime he tried to get into best shape and guys it's worked Minnesota is winning and they're the number one rated defense in the NBA Stephanie that late has uh come on without a doubt for Anthony Edwards Devin Booker suddenly starting to cook and we got a four-point game but maybe the scariest thing about Anthony Edwards G he's 22 Yeah here he comes into the paint taking some contact and he's going to shoot a couple of free throws it's on Gordon yeah and and I love you know he gave coach Finch a lot of credit but coach Finch talked a lot about the impact Rudy Gobert had had on the whole team in terms of challenging them and getting them to understand the importance of that side of the ball and that's really kind of morph this team into what is now a ke contender in this Western Conference oh you still have time to win a million bucks make your picks with NBA pick them bracket challenge presented by air time submit your playoff bracket before they lock this week at nba.com SL bracket for in the NBA out Drew Eubanks and Bradley Field have check in for Phoenix first time we're seeing Eubanks as McDaniels gets a breather nurkic and Durant to the bench for Frank vogle so final two and a half to play the quarter Here Comes Booker trying to turn the corner and this will be on Kart Anthony-Towns and it will be his second so suddenly Booker on the attack for the Suns yeah and and listen that's a play where the contact was down low and that's what the officials made the call on I don't think coach vinch wants to take another chance there you can see that and I think they're saying that that contact caused him to lose control of the ball but I had a teammate that would say after they miss a free free throw ball Don't Lie the great poet philosopher rashed W she so six-point game for one of the elite players in the sport Devin Booker now 27 years of age he's made it a five-point game critical minutes here with Durant on the bench only 213 left in the quarter so towns playing with two Alexander Walker knives in Eubanks redirecting the shot up the floor comes Gordon streaks to the paint boy Anthony Edwards head almost hit the backboard Monte Morris is whistled for his first the athleticism the fireworks that this kid has in his legs G just when you see it up close it's just incredible he's physically intimidating I said that earlier at that size with the wingspan how strong he is and then the force with which he plays well can Eric Gordon give this Phoenix team something off their bench that's been such a a source of concern for them you mentioned the the bench scoring differential in game one Gordon struggled the last couple of weeks of the regular season but he's got a guy he's a guy with a ton of playoff experience yeah and if I'm Phoenix I'm feeling good right now because defensively they're doing a good job as they're going to get a foul on War there the issue has been the turnovers each starter has turned it over at least once here to start the game and they've given up 11 points Minnesota only has 20 so from a defensive standpoint they've been solid it's just that their offense hasn't allowed their defense to be at its best so again Karl Anthony-Towns playing with two personals he'll shoot free throws here with 153 left in the quarter and Minnesota holding this three-point lead both Co which is mik for sound tonight let's listen in okay we're getting some good things offensively great screen on McDaniels great screen on Kart Anthony-Towns that's how we got a screen okay physical as hell we got to win the physicality battle it shows up in screening and with blockout hey we got to do a better job of boxing out okay they got like three rebounds in the mid-range okay those are Smalls got to own those Chris Finch year four here in Minneapolis and Frank Fogle first season in the desert third team he has taken into the NBA postseason as Beal little contact nothing called Gordon hard to the wreck and we talked about it how dominant Minnesota was on that backboard that has not been the case here tonight the rebounding numbers in fact favoring Phoenix 107 how about that turnar around so far Reid left open Booker against Morris as we come up on the final minute in the quarter Booker trying to create some space elevates short Here Comes Edwards with a match up against Booker into the tee to the defense contact with O'Neal coming to help and it's last touch boy looks like Booker is hurt as he bore the brunt of that collision and he's still down looks like he got caught up above the neck there boy the whistle is on Karl Anthony-Townsjust Greg that's his third personal that's a huge play there just because it limits your rotational diversity if you're Finch so Chris Finch rolling the dice keeping towns on the floor and it comes back to haunt him here with 53.9 seconds left in the quarter and we talked about it I I understood it with Frank Boger you got a top 75 player with all the experience that Kevin Durant has you know he has the ability to stay out of foul trouble but call Anthony-Towns here that's a little more questionable you see he's just coming in attack clearly comes over the back there that's just just not a heads up play there by towns a little bit Reckless considering the circumstances so towns sits now who knows how long he's on the bench into the second quarter so Booker readies himself free throw is good and crazy this is a one-point game with 53 seconds left in the quarter Phoenix shooting just 38% but Booker has brought them back they've done it with Kevin Durant on the bench the last couple of minutes after he picked up his second and this one is last touched underneath by Eubanks when I tell you we talked about Phoenix defensively much more active and More Physical at the point of attack yeah it's been interesting to see Frank vogo slowly start to put his defensive imprint on this team as Eubanks trying to throw it off the the leg of Alexander Walker and Phoenix slowly but surely has crept into the top 15 in the league in defensive rating they're now 12th in the league Edwards bounce underneath and they turn it over it's been it's the passing cuz Edwards had Morris open a count earlier but the late delivery allowed for Phoenix to recover defensively Roy Beal got away with a travel underneath Eubanks G I don't think the crowd like that mount call I don't think they're going to like any call that goes against Minnesota Booker into the corner Gordon misses on a three and the rebound knocking him the hands of Reid 15 seconds Reid looking to push and he it up boy what a pass Gordon ahead to Booker and then it's Beal misses it dunk Morris three seconds Bo circus shot and that's a huge SE went there right looks like you got the advantage you missed the dunk and then give up the layup and transition on the other end fourpoint swing as we get some late fireworks to close out that first quarter Bradley Beal going to be thinking about this one during the break and at the other end it is Morris building on that lead you're watching the first round on TNT presented by nerd Waller Downtown Minneapolis as we get set for the start of the second quarter Minnesota with a three-point lead and seconds ago Stephanie ready spending some time with Yousef nerkish thank you so much okay you have a larger sample in terms of what they do on the other side how do you counter that number one defense in the NBA just being physical you know they have a two bigs out there young guy guard who play defense know they just been exra physical with us we got to respond I think we're doing so far okay so now you've got three quarters left is there anything in the game plan that you think you have to tweak moving forward give a ball to our best players they got a lot of power we got to do it but also a start on defense thanks for tpping good luck yep see I would have Lov to play with a guy like Nurkic he he he knows where his bread is butter simple and sweet Bradley be the kick out of traffic Gordon's going to fire wa that's a deep shot for Gordon and he's given them a shot in the arm with this second unit and we are tied and we talked about who would be that X Factor for Phoenix not as deep as say Minnesota Eric Gordon has been that here in this first half G give us your thoughts so far All Things Considered what we saw in the opener with the rebounding discrepancy as Gordon is bumped here by Morris your observation so far I think nurkic hit it right on the head they they've matched the physicality in fact they've been more physical I I think they have been the ones to kind of dictate how the game is going to be played they've raised their level having said that Minnesota is still winning but that's them winning while you haven't had Durant or Booker get going offensively Gordon little floater with the left hand follows his own Miss gets it into the corner and now they're going to reset to Beal Kevin Durant still on the bench with his Suns he picked up his second personal in the first quarter be with Gobert there Nurkic is bumped this will be on Gobert and Zack Zara Blows the Whistle underneath so nurkic giving them something on the interior to try to combat the Twin City Towers here with go and Karl Anthony-Townshe just hopped on with his Kart Anthony-Towns picked up his third personal at the 53 second Mark of the first quarter so he begins the quarter da on that Minnesota bench and you know you go back we talked about matching the physicality game one Phoenix had three offensive rebounds they've already gotten five here in this first half so that tells you that they are competing at a much higher make it six now level than they did in that first game Gordon knifes in drops one inside and it's nerkish again first lead for Phoenix after they were down by nine early 124 Phoenix run going back to the first Gobert the spin kicks out this is Morris elevates short and Minnesota's offense has gone Stone Cold now under 40% shooting from the field nurkic able to find the laces and look at this another offensive glass rebound O'Neal however turns it over Conley boy Allen is going to be called for a second looked like nearly had the clean strip more free throws for the timber wolves yeah that was a great find there late by Conley and really a terrific play by Allen to not allow him to get that dunk not allow him to get this crowd enthused and back into the game so Naz Reid to the free throw line weed having a career year crazy to think this guy was undrafted what a piece he's turning into for this franchise as he misses on the first little sneak peek at the upcoming playoff schedule TNT True TV have a double header tomorrow couple of game twos heat Celtics in Boston and the Pelicans Thunder we'll see what those two have for an oncore in our OKC from one of these games nba.com or visit the NBA app Kevin Durant reinserted by Frank vogle and she'll play with two personals Booker on the bench one point Fe Phoenix lead couple of minutes gone by here in the second games three and four this series in Phoenix on Friday and Sunday respectively nage boy Beal beautiful back door cut as he left Alexander Walker in his dust and that's for one of the advantages by having a center who can play facing the basket it makes go beer have to get out of the paint and creates those opportunities down low Conley turn to the corner and he goes glass he's got all those moves in his box what a career it's been for Conley Beal little stop and go hesitation brilliant offensive maneuver by Beal and one thing I love about Phoenix is they're pushing tempo right again the faster you play the smaller Minnesota becomes it doesn't allow them to Lock and Load defensively and kind of puts them on their heels second bucket for Beal he's got four McDaniels nearly lost his footing as's one move inside of 9 minutes left in the half go out to McDaniels curling no second times at charm all that length from McDaniels how about the second and third efforts there they're going to get a delay of game on McDaniels there which was the right call TR didn't like it but that was the right call but how about the effort there and the stick to it Miss by McDaniels Zach's Z telling Devin Booker he's got to wait to check in at the table with Monte Morris so points off turnover is really the only weakness from Phoenix tonight their turnovers have led to 12 Minnesota points 120 in fact in points off turnover so far but when they haven't turned it over they've had quality possessions either scoring or attacking the offensive glass and listen they're playing a great defensive team so it's it's not going to be perfect but they've just got to continue to try to limit the live ball turnovers third three-pointer for Phoenix Mike Conley Jr Freddy floater nurkic back door to Durant as McDaniels takes his turn Kevin Durant fading away he hits just masterful and a chance at three for Kevin Durant he can push it to a five-point lead yeah and just another solid play by nurkin he gets Gobert out of there right and puts a body on him and just gives enough space for Durant even though McDaniels has great length length doesn't really bother Kevin Durant it it's the physicality and and McDaniels doesn't have a huge advantage in that area against him so he's going to be able to get where he wants to go he had 31 in game one it was actually his highest scoring game in a month April has been Kevin Durant's lowest scoring month of the Season he's only averaged about 23 efficiency shooting numbers down this month but boy it's playoff time it's Kevin Durant time was off the charts in game one here's Edwards off the back iron rebound weak Side by Durant trying to pick his pocket is McDaniels and Kevin Durant somehow going to get it to nage so a five-point Phoenix lead Allen's three rims out The League leader in three-point percentage Phoenix comes up empty Conley gets Allen on his back and then he turns it over two11 run out Kevin Durant and Booker contact offensive on Booker what a defensive play by Morris it was a good play by Morris but I thought it was actually more of a poor decision by Devin Booker there he's got that patented pullup and you see here he instead of stopping you could see that Morris had already established position there you might want to just pull up on that one and G they're going to challenge this Frank foggle using his challenge with 77 left in this opening half on TNT the Left Foot Down therefore the ruling on the floor successful challenge by Frank V they're going to overturn the call and that is a pretty significant call so both coaches have had a successful challenge G you were pretty stunned by this I'm I'm still shocked I I you know you don't have to be stationary you don't have to be a statue you just have to establish position and my rule was always if your shoulder was right into the middle of the chest that means you've established position so your feet can still be meeting moving having said that back ARA didn't agree and that's a huge break for Phoenix you stay true to your conviction I respect that Devin Booker steps to the free throw line so both coaches rolling the dice they've both been successful with their first challenge so each will maintain it here and now Devin Booker has given the Suns a seven-point lead Karl Anthony-Towns still on the bench with three personals yeah and and Minnesota has not looked good offensively at all they have no rhythm and Anthony awards really has not been able to create much space to play Mike Conley Jr giving him a shot in the arm off the bench he has been really good here in this first half struggled game one only two of 12 from the field but he can sense his team needs a jolt offensively and he's providing it here in the first half Conley of course another start came off the bench to begin this quarter as Durant Boy Tough turnar around shot taking on some contacts Kevin Durant's got seven you can't defend it any better and that's the beauty of having a superstar because they can score consistently against great defense one thing to keep in mind Phoenix swept a three- game regular season series between these two before everything changed in game one Edwards misses everything there so Minnesota comes up empty you see I mean you you're not going to defend it much better he's able to also get the contest but dur just so skilled and so smooth there with the Finish Phoenix Suns team that went 49 and 33 during the regular season they're one of the better Road teams in the league 24- 17 really strong finish to the regular season what a pass Beal to yub and suddenly the Suns slicing him up in a great roll I tell you the center position for Phoenix thus far has been about as good as it can be they have been terrific on both ends boy you knew Phoenix would answer the Bell after they were blown out in game one McDaniels Corner Pocket three and I will say Anthony Edwards hasn't been overly aggressive at getting to the rim and credit Phoenix for that but he's done a great job of facilitating for his teammates meanwhile at this end Phoenix in the quarter eight of 12 shoot as the efficiency levels have gone way up Durant knocked to the deck here trying to come around the screen and boy already penalty situation for Minnesota and Durant's going to shoot two now that play that we just saw there what happened was they ran a little pick top picker action and Booker actually was able to Shield off Gobert and didn't allow him to rotate over to contest on that slam so Kevin Durant who was at 86% at the line during the regular season makes good on the first the NBA on TNT is brought to you by State Farm like a good neighbor State Farm is there what a scene this is Target Center downtown Minneapolis a franchise that has won all of two playoff series in their history they both came during that 04 run to the Western Conference finals and already some foul trouble to both of these coaches are thinking about Corner three Morris short and Minnesota now G three of 12 from three Bradley be guarded by Edwards and Edwards the fif by Aaron pass ke wolves nearly turned it over right back Gobert got caught and it was actually coar that made how about a heads up play by him to reach in and get that steal although he almost it over a couple times there but Minnesota will retain possession and they are missing Karl Anthony-Towns those three fouls having to sit those extended minutes he's a guy that can be a first option offensively but Mike Conley says I got you Mike Conley first Timberwolf tonight in double digits he's got 12 and he is picking up some of the scoring SL put towns on that bench he has been terrific be he's got a lot of playoff experience is not afraid of the moment look at what Conley has done just a massive first half for him Booker against Morris isolated backs him down to the Box leans in and puts it down de Booker really physical at that Wing position does a great job look out Booker and McDaniels have to be separated you can see it as they came down the floor little pushing and shoving between them officials quickly get between to try to diffuse things and you saw Devin Booker give him credit he understood the moment and didn't retaliate sensing you do something foolish there and you're out of this game so that was smart Booker is feisty as in he is Elite and it's getting heated folks now I didn't get to see the yeah you see the push there we're looking at the monitor up above here in the arena folks let's take a look at this replay as they were coming up spir Greg it's going to be interesting to see how they foul on Booker the foul is under review will there be a little bit extra here so that emphatic shove by McDaniels at the end of the play right there from Booker it's going to be a double Tech and cuz he did he retaliated didn't like that screen that was set on him right there yeah right there right exactly and then he leaned back into him and then the push there so you'll probably get a double Tech but my bat and average isn't very good tonight partner after that challenge on the charge you went out on a Lim again oh yeah that so Zach zarba and tiven have the headsets on at the table now in contact with the replay Command Center back in Su caucus so a Sixpoint Phoenix lead again if you're Frank vogle you have to be really pleased had a couple of off days here to to hit the drawing board and what a but what a difference couple of days makes for the Suns yeah and let me say this also if you're Chris Fincher pleased as well you your two best offensive players have not really had much of an impact in terms of scoring if you think about Anthony Edwards Karl Anthony-Towns a combin one of seven from the field and you look up and you're down six you're not going to be too upset about that so both teams are feeling pretty good right now with how this thing is played out all right the officials have seen enough now having one last conference so the call on the floor is just a a personal against Booker but you have to think there's going to be at least one Tech here if not on both of those players and so like we had a play earlier where they went back and reviewed to see if Grayson Allen stepped out of bounds and they have the ability to change that so even on that play there you could after the foul by Booker was deemed to be a common foul added to the plays a technical foul on McDaniels will shoot one for Phoenix and def foul down here and I I think what they're doing is because that first hit by McDaniels that could have been a foul but they got the retaliation on Booker and then the technical is for the extension of the Arms by McDaniels there and again the crowd won't like it but you know looking at that first hit I I can understand where they're going and if you're McDaniel you got to just keep your head you know right now there's a lot of frustration by Minnesota and if you're fence you're tell them guys as bad as it is this a three possession game we're fine our guys haven't gotten going let's not lose our heads here and just stay under control so you got 50% of that call right so your Bing average does creep up a little bit okay back to with baseball I'll be what 333 right now I'm okay with it's a Hall of Fame batting average so seven-point game with Booker stepping up to the free throw line 415 left in the half a Phoenix Suns team that was blown out of the gym by 2 eight points in game one looking a whole lot better here tonight Conley pick and roll action to Gobert fullens angry flush by the Frenchman and again Mike Conley there with great time and you know about their history and chemistry having them teammates prior to go there coming to Minnesota but Booker coughs it up McDaniels run out long strides misses Point Blank Allen up the floor quickly underneath Eubanks sneaking behind the defense and great job of taking advantage of that blown layup getting the ball up the cour quickly and Eubanks running the floor again that Center position for Phoenix has been impactful boy what a swing that is instead of cutting it to five they're back down by seven actually chance to cut it to three McDaniels play tough shot on a little step back so McDaniels now the third Timber wolven double figures with 10 five-point game Booker boy nearly cough it up again trying to tie him up and Zar is going to give him the timeout Minnesota arguing that Booker didn't have complete control as the Suns avoid consecutive turnovers and that intensity level continues to rise here in Minnesota on TNT here in Minneapolis let's see who's enjoying the Limelight it's presented by Corona Kevin Durant and Devon Booker only the third set of teammates they ever average at least 27 points per game in the history of the NBA Shack and Kobe elen Baylor Jerry West how far does this Phoenix Suns team go a couple of interesting notes looking at the scoreboard box scor should say Anthony Edwards only one for five Karl Anthony-Towns hasn't hit a basket yet with his foul trouble and Edwards has been oddly passive G so far yeah he he hasn't been I I get you wanting to kind of like just let the game come to you but I I'd like to see him play more as an athlete getting two feet in the paint and he hasn't done that very often and speaking of getting in the paint how about the rant there starting to heat up remember he started the game one of four but obviously starting to find his rhythm Karl Anthony-Townsstill on the Minnesota this entire quarter after he picked up his third personal at the end of the first Here Comes con Le boy that is a thing of beauty going left hand on a scoop and you know the other thing you love about Mike Conley he senses that his guys aren't there right now and he still has that ability to provide a spark offensively that's what you want from your point just an ultra feel for the game Durant inside Eubanks boy wide open and it's last Touch by Phoenix underneath he he rushed that he must have felt go B because that was an opportunity to just go up and slam that one home but he quick shot it ends up missing this was a phoenix team that won seven of its final 10 to close the regular season Corner three near side no good from Alexander Walker as Minnesota comes up empty and even though Edwards didn't shoot that he forced Phoenix to double team him and created a great opportunity there weeks out Durant kep a couple of screens from EU Banks going to fire back iron rebound Conley as we hit the final 90 seconds of the half boy has this been a physical game and credit Phoenix for making the adjustments rebounding points in the paint Second Chance points they've been doing it all McDaniels ring the way over Durant and it's last touched by Phoenix let's check in with Stephanie guys you were talking about Mike Conley and his offensive output tonight while I spoke to him this morning about what his role was and he told me his role is to be the vet to make these players on his team the best that they can be but to also provide whatever is needed he said I can score 30 a night but that's not my job but if they need me to score I will look to score and guys he's looking to score 14 points already he had four in the last game yeah big turnar around for Conley Stephanie there's a three that time too much Alexander Walker McDaniels into the corner this is Conley again slithers into the paint no Gobert muscles the rebound and he's going to shoot three pros and that attack by Conley creates an opportunity for Gobert to attack the offensive glass and as Stephanie mentioned he's on Pace right now to get 30 he's he's got 14 here in this first half and has really provided a huge offensive Spark as has Rudy Gobert perfect five of five from the field it's been interesting to watch this dynamic between Gobert and Karl Anthony-Towns of course it just look so clunky early last year we asked Chris Finch when he thought things started to turn with those two he actually mentioned their first round Series against Denver last year where they started to make a breakthrough it gave them the template the blueprint going into the off seon and this year of course they've Tak a huge lead yeah and that's a great point because you know if you think about the postseason it's a lot like training camp because you're going to have a lot of time to work on specifics to game plan to get a sense and a feel for how your guys function together and now that they've been able to establish that chemistry it has really allowed this team to go to another level go be's got a dozen points Booker inside of a minute left be it left open well short and Phoenix goes one and done up the floor comes Edwards McDaniels out of the corner goes right into the chest of Durant and how aggressive has Jaden McDaniels been here tonight nurit five to shoot stumbling spinning missed it Edwards pushes ahead to Conley 5 Seconds Edwards into the corner Alexander Walker and that's going to get us to halftime here in Minneapolis the Wolves close on an 8-2 spurt and despite getting just five points from Edwards and two from Karl Anthony-Towns Minnesota is within a point at halftime both teams playing with intensity and physicality and boy you couldn't ask for anything more than a game two in the playoffs this place has been electric one-point lead for the Suns you're watching the first round on TNT presented by nerd Wallen Downtown Minneapolis this great am am City one of these two teams have in store for us down the stretch a one-point halime lead for Phoenix as we check out our rewarding performance presented by Capital One and boy what a drastic difference in some key areas game one GA to so far what we've seen tonight that and also the impact they've had on towns and Edwards not allowing those guys to get into any kind of Rhythm offensively so this is the kind of game if you're Phoenix it has to be their concern now has to be can we limit the live ball turnovers in the second half boy Edwards gets Right to Work misses Point Blank Oar trying to tap it in and they come up empty so the Minnesota Timberwolves a 28-point win in game one gotting everything they can handle so far here in game two nurkic on the Kart Anthony-Townsch good position underneath Gobert was there bothered the shot nurkic second times a charm and that's another offensive rebound right a good job of understanding he didn't get that first shot off the way he wanted but able to Coral that offensive rebound and his seventh offensive re uh rebound overall tonight as towns just trying to get himself going he played only8 minutes in the first half he picked up his third personal at the 53 second Mark of the first quarter and sat the entire second dur against go physical contact from the perimeter Kevin Durant going left Miss that's a heck of a job defensively by Gobert not allowing Kevin Durant to create space there and able to get the contest Bo it shows you some of his greatness defensively doing that against Kevin Durant on the perimeter here's McDaniels good seal off by Booker and he turns it over let's check in with Stephanie Steph you spoke to Chris Finch I did and I asked him hey if I told you that Kart Anthony-Towns and ant would combined for seven points and six rebounds in the first half and you'd only be down one would you take it he giggled kind of a little bit he said yeah including all the foul trouble that were in so he knew that they were in a good position he said he wants to see the offense move the ball more they're getting open looks are just not knocking him down he did say the rebounding was a concern and he wanted them to play a little bit smarter all right let's see how his team bounces back Stephan here in the second half nerk going drop step pretty with his feet just couldn't finish yeah but again that that's the go be fact he doesn't get a block but gets a rushed shot I think that's a stat they should sh start keeping they going to get Bill for stepping out of bounds because that's two straight layup attempts really three that he was able to alter because he speeds you up his shot blocking prowers really forces you to try to get the shot off a count quicker than normal and often times that forces a Miss A Phoenix Suns team have finished the regular season winning 10 of their final four 14 against a really tough schedule that is McDaniels with a 23y old coming hard to the cup yeah and listen Anthony Edwards hasn't been able to get to the rim consistently but he has created some great opportunities for his teammates that was one where he put McDaniels in a position where he could attack where Kevin Durant misses another one in tight and again it's the presence of Rudy Gobert even when he doesn't get his hand on it just such a massive presence Conley misses Point Blank and then nurkic takes a little shove it'll be against go and Grayson Allen comes up limp there Bo Allen is still down remember he tweaked his ankle in game one didn't quite see what happened but he is in a world of pain underneath that is significant and you know you say well he's only got three points but folks often times when you can shoot it the way he does his spacing creates a lot of opportunity for your best players to attack it was his right ankle in game one hard to see G which leg it is there another look at the replay Allen the it's the same right ankle oh that's that is that's going to put his availability in doubt not just for the rest of the night but for this series remember game Three is coming up on Friday as Bradley Beal able to push this to a three-point lead so how did Phoenix Now respond after seeing Grayson Allen limp into that locker room here comes Kart Anthony-Towns contact and he's going to shoot fre throws yeah so that's the second time where Anthony Edward's presence creates an advantage because he gives you a pass that you can attack so you watch this play here watch how McDaniels reads he's got him in rotation that creates an opportunity to attack and because you got gobear down there posting doesn't allow nage the opportunity to contest and he just did it again for towns where they load to Anthony Edwards by being a willing passer it creates an opportunity to attack the Karl Anthony-Towns and now getting to the free throw line and you haven't had the ball go through the basket from the perimeter it maybe helps you get your Rhythm here so good job of Distributing by Anthony Edwards towns remember the 18 games he missed after tearing the meniscus in his knee he returned for the last two regular season games still still trying to get himself up to speed but it's been interesting to watch him he hasn't pressed you know he's he's deferred a little bit to Anthony Edwards just trying to let things come to him and I wanted to see how he responded to adversity you see Grayson Allen that does not look like the sign of someone that's going to be coming back here tonight but I was always concerned with car Anthony TOs emotional stability as you see nurk is there with a great post up and able to deliver in the paint and I I like how he's responding because he's not overly emotional he's still under control his car Anthony-Towns and I think that's been really going to be important for this young Timberwolves team throughout this series you nerkish pleading his case 12 seconds on the shot clock for Minnesota so Frank fog and Company how do they handle this now without R and Allen boy what a play it's towns hard move to the hole and no question getting to that free throw line understanding the matchup that he has and the lack of Rim protection that Phoenix possesses and he was not to be denied on that attack first made basket tonight for Karl Anthony-Towns and he can tie it right here and one thing to focus on and I tell this to Young play you get the postseason your stats don't matter you got to focus on time and score that's all that matters so even though he was not as effective because the foul trouble in that first half it was a one-point game that's all that matters in the second half it's about doing whatever I can to help my team get a done so we are even at 57 we come up on the 8 Minute Mark in quarter number three game two here in Minneapolis many Minnesota's gone to this Zone and they force that missed Corner three there soel unable to hit Edwards falling out of bounds gets it to towns that's good and again Anthony Edwards there again statistically not lighting it up but he is controlling the floor in the half court with his decision making Durant hitting the rim a couple of times Miss fires first lead for the Timberwolves since the end of the first quarter Edwards doing his dance underneath this is McDaniels and now they're going to reset Town's going to fire the old heat check it it it really does look good every time it leaves his hands though that guy can flat out shoot it Townsshot 42% from three in this regular season beautiful setup Booker into the corner for Beal and Phoenix punches back and that's that coveted Corner three that teams work so desperately to create in the half court or the loss of Allen for Phoenix so significant here's Edwards on the answer missfires and Anthony Edwards is now one for seven from the field Booker steps into a three splash I tell you the elev a he gets on that jump shot is as good as anybody in this league backto back threes for Phoenix six straight As the suns are backing front on TNT here in Minneapolis you are watching the 2024 NBA playoffs presented by Google pixel three-point Phoenix lead backto back threes Bradley Beal and Devin Booker so Anthony Edwards su he did in the opener 33 points five tonight he does have six assists couple of steals so he's impacted the game GA in other areas but at some point they need him to get out of first gear yeah one thing I I like for young players to learn is how to play well when you're not playing well and by that I mean when shots aren't falling then you figure out other ways to impact the game and one of the things that happens with Gobert for all the positives when they go with the two bigs is they going to miss that corner three but a great offensive rebound by McDaniels there to get that dece one of the issues is you don't put the defense in rotation because they can load and almost Zone up because of your personnel so let's see what this unit out here now for Minnesota if he can get into the teeth of the defense tough shot for Booker kept Alive by nkic who has been a beast on the offensive glass tonight Durant near we stepped out of bounds shot clock at seven this is is rice O'Neal beating Edwards boy who got him from the back what a defensive recovery Here Comes Edwards Beal and it's going to be a reaching foul and that's one way to get going get out in the open floor to utilize that incredible athletic ability and get yourself to the line so Anthony Edwards who was an 84% free throw shooter will take his third thir and fourth of the night the NBA on TNT is brought to you by Chipotle real flavor real ingredients Chipotle for real so great to have you with us Target Center standing room only 20,000 plus spiritus Greg Anthony Stephanie ready our producer B Bond Andy Goldberg our director rest of our Sensational TNT crew Phoenix trying to do what no team has done so far in these playoffs win as a road team nit shot clock down to one he's got no idea it's deflected and then bill turned back by Edwards and he lets him hear about it great job there defensively and and nurk is just got to be a little more cognizant of where he is in relation to the shot clock he's got to be trying to get to some dhos with the Personnel they have on the floor keep your eye on Edwards and be drawing at each other a little bit as be went right back at him this will be contact against Booker off ball as Beal and Edwards are still drawing at each other that'll be the second against Booker I think that's going to put Minnesota into the penalty here for the rest of this quarter that's their fourth foul so they'll be shooting free throws from here on out Frank vogle replaces ryce O'Neal with Eric Gordon shot clock at 10 this is Naz Reid rolls down the paint extends beautiful how about the versati that's what I meant about now you can play more five out which makes it a little bit harder defensively to load to the basketball so Alex Rodriguez Mark Lori limited partners Durant spinning Minnesota's got it Chris fch trying to get Edwards to play faster don't let the defense set deal extending his defense and this is going to put Minnesota in the bonus and that's an example of why you want to pick up the pace we talked about it earlier when you're struggling against the loaded defense play earlier in the shot clock don't allow them to get set there and deal just a little overzealous there trying to deny here we just saw aod and Mark Lori Glen Taylor is seated directly across from them the ownership situation here I think they're going to have dinner tonight you think they will get together after the game boy that has added some Intrigue hasn't it with this franchise Glen Taylor you know the agreement to sell the franchise now that thing is going to mediation on May 1st Minnesota with eight straight points a lot of contact and finally they get it on Edwards and and they get the foul but if you're Bradley Beal and Phoenix just throw the ball ahead like I I remember when I used to play at Mugsy B who's an incredible Defender you don't want to go against this all he's doing is eating up that shot clock just throw the ball ahead get into your offense don't allow that pressure to dictate how The Possession goes here comes Beal hard move missed it nurkic crashes the glass again here comes Gordon the shot clock didn't reset wait did that get rim no it did I didn't think he hit rim on that I was just a great effort of nurkic understanding too again when you get the dribble penetration it's going to create Avenues to attack the offensive glass and merage and really this entire Suns team's done a great job of that here in game two so side out of bounds for Phoenix as we come up on the 4minute mark in this third quarter this is Gordon puts it on the deck barrels into the paint well short of the floater Kart Anthony-Towns clears so Phoenix's offense has gone cold their shooting percentage now he's dipped to 41% and they've missed their last five Edwards on a launch boy nurkic has been the Lynch pin in what has been just a crazy turnaround in the rebounding numbers game one to tonight nurkic with his 12th rebound he's been terrific not just with the rebounding but he's made a lot of plays for Phoenix as well keeps it alive to Durant elevates short and they still can't buy one here we go right here Edwards against Durant Edwards wants to take him elevates and buries it I was just about to say wasn't really a great shot but that's what great players can do great players have that ability to score against great defense ewards gets this crowd rocking here in Minneapolis La look at our fandu lab point spread for tonight's game you see where it started you see where it's at as Minnesota has turned that deficit into a seven-point lead with 303 lips so 10 unanswered for Minnesota Phoenix G has not scored in three and 1 half minutes they've missed seven straight shots Alexander Walker extending his defense and he forces a turnover and that's the thing about having that point guard because it's a different handle when you have to deal with pressure we saw Anthony Edwards extended against Bradley Beal there Nickeille Walker able to extend it against Devin Booker Edwards double team gets it to Alexander Walker now McDaniels out of the corner spins but he's got everything working tonight and I go back to Anthony Edwards having a terrific game even though he's not shooting it well he's got the highest plus minus of anybody on the Timberwolves team because of plays like that and boy was that needed for the Suns quick timeout taken by Chris Finch with 229 left late third quarter on TNT k D get Phoenix's first points in more than 4 minutes as they have cut this to seven let's check in with Stephanie well Spar the Wolves defense has been well documented that it's number one in the NBA so I asked Mike Conley about why it was so good he said he honestly believes it's the combination of the five guys out there they're really a complete defensive team they're not relying on just Rudy as we saw they made those defensive stops with Gobert on the bench we not relying on Kart Anthony-Towns or Jaden or on an they all play defense they take pride in it and guys it's turning into easy offense which helps them when they're struggling Naz Reid barreling the cup he's going to shoot free throws there is no doubt it is a full deep team commitment to defense here for Minnesota under Chris Finch as this franchise continues its Ascension 56 wins this season got up to the number three seed they of course flirted with the number one seed Greg right up until the end of the regular season and now the only question is how far can this team go and and they can they can go to the finals they're they're good now they've got a ways to go offensively we know that but their defense is Championship caliber and in part of what Stephanie is talking about you think about you got three all NBA Defenders when you think about McDaniels Anthony Edwards he probably won't make it this year but he is without question a guy who's got all NBA all defense caliber talent and with go probably going to win the defensive player of the year again and listen my been all defense in this like they've got guys that not only can still compete defensively but they understand how to play defense they understand team defense and boy they got a lot of athletes on the floor boy you saw the free throw discrepancy in this quarter that's a big part of the story as well as Devin Booker boy now he comes up a little bit hobbled and looks like he's in some pain and I thought he did that on that turnover he had against uh m Alexander Walker it looked like he kind of got that knee felt awkwardly Bradley be nearly picking Edward's pocket as he ratchets up the defense 8 seconds to shoot and 138 left as those two Beal and Edwards continue to battle Edwards going right back at him into the corner Alexander Walker fills it up with a corner pocket three and I'm just loving the decision making by Edwards and then how about the impact Alexander Walker has had for this group Off the Bench had shot it great but boy he has been solid defensively year five for him career best season from three and he's called for a reach in here they still had one to give but they did say that he was well now he just realized it's a side out of bounds and Gordon can't believe it I I thought he was in the act of shooting as well but the officials say no and they got to take the ball out on the sideline Gordon's going to lose that argument as he barks in the direction of Chien to theci side out of bound Eubanks get run into by Durant and here we go six to shoot Kevin Durant Eubanks rolls to the cup that was a smart play by yank terrific pass but yank saw that Gobert had extended there on that double team which created that pass and now just an unforced error with the turnover boy Drew Eubanks again all the talk about bench scoring or lack thereof for the Suns he's given them a half dozen Off the Bench G they'll take anything they can get from that second unit and overall they've done a good job and there's going to get a turnover with the kick ball off of the ran foot it looks like it from my angle but they I don't think they're going to challenge it wa Frank vogle just absolutely IR so a phoenix turnover with 43 seconds left in the quarter another look at it from this Vantage Point boy they got a good argument looked like it was off Reid's foot but they are this is a tough to break it they do have a challenge but they do they won one earlier interesting Minnesota had an opportunity to go two for one here Edwards elevates short little contact between Beal and towns got a 5sec shot to game clock 14 on the timer Minnesota is out of fouls five to shoot Kevin Durant is bumped and he'll step to the straight and that is the fourth on towns and the fourth foul at this stage is not a killer but I just did not like that decision by Karl Anthony-Towns there that there's no reason when you're out there on an island by yourself to put the onus on the official you've just got to be a little more disciplined defensively knowing they're in the penalty G you saw the run from Minnesota as Kevin Durant rolls in first where did this game turn from what you've seen in this third quarter I I just think their defense you know if you think about that stretch Phoenix struggled to get good looks at The Rim their offense didn't create anything easy and they ended up having to play a lot more through nerkish than they would like to and and so that's look when you got the Firepower that they have they've got to be better even though they they're going against a great defensive team at creating opportunities in the half court 15 for Durant final 4 seconds Edwards nearly coughed it up and it's going to be reaching fouled free throws for Edwards boy that's stings a little bit with 1.3 left on the clock and this time it's on O'Neal but Edwards did a great job of attacking before Phoenix got their defense set generally he's going to be able to beat one Defender consistently and they didn't have the rotation there in time to th it Minnesota has led by as many as nine going back early to the first quarter before Phoenix stormed back they took an eight-point lead before this thing turns quickly back into Minnesota's favor in this third quarter Edwards misses the second rebound O'Neal Frank Fogle pleading for the foul there late we saw a lot of this in in game one as they surround tiffen in front of that Phoenix bench but I like that di allowed those guys the opportunity to kind of yell seveno Minesota Lee you're watching the first round on TNT presented by nerd wallet welcome back to Minneapolis and the 17-year bet Mike Conley got off to a terrific start really kept Minnesota in this game in that first half and just kind of set the tone and calm them down and allow them to kind of extend that lead and moments ago our Stephanie ready caught up with the point guard Mike you guys had a come back in the beginning of the game and now you've taken the lead do you want to see to continue to pull away I think our mentality has to stay the same we got to stay aggressive um being physical defensively and try to keep our head in the game you mentally there's some calls going you know back and forth and we just got to fight through that and um and play the game that we know how to play we've seen your defense really take control of the game but on the offensive end what can you do to make it sharp make it more clean uh we got to create space for each other I think the court is getting Shunk a little bit they're loading up on ant uh an's trying to make the right read and other guys got to make the right read after that so uh just pass pass play the pass and try to get get a good shot thanks for shopping good luck all right thank you all right Steph he's been doing it for 17 years just crazy to think boy another Phoenix turnover as nage crumples to the deck Conley up the floor quickly into the corner McDaniels back to Alexander Walker they'll reset excellent ball movement here's Gobert spins and he's bumped and the Really the theme of this game if you're the the Phoenix Suns is your inability to take care of the basketball 23 points off those turnovers by Phoenix Minnesota conversely only two points given off off their nine turnovers and they got a chance to get a couple more here so that's really been what's got to be disconcerting for Frank Bogle and his team Phoenix was up 5150 at halftime but they're outscored in the third quarter 28- 20 and right now they're down eight Frank Hogle Mike for sound tonight hey that quarter went really bad it's a seven-point game hey that's nothing he they just came back from down 20 last game we get right back in this do we stop down here stopped and breaks okay stopped and breakes give me some big threes I need a big three from both you guys in these next four minutes he shot ready look for it hunted Frank vogle working hard trying to rally the troops in that Sun's timeout huddle Here Comes SK full head of steam play just masterful got Gobert on his back and lays it up and in it's a seven-point game and Fs got 14 and a good job of using nerkish as a pressure release with that extended press there by Minnesota by the way Stephanie ready confirming that Grayson Allen is done for the night tweaks his right ankle as Kart Anthony-Towns keeps it alive to Conley Here Comes Alexander Walker High arching floater and that was a second chance opportunity Karl Anthony-Towns with an incredible effort there to keep it alive Gordon just a massive shot for Phoenix and this is the team fifth best in the league in terms of three-point percentage so they can get it up and get it in with the best of them boy what a pass Gobert Conley dropping dimes and a great job overloading the wheat side there and creating that opportunity late on the rotation were the Suns Mike Conley Jr 14 in the first half carving him up Booker defended tightly and he turns it over again we you go back to it again Rudy Gobert has been incredible defensive you see how they got it overloaded there and then the road ations late you got to see that anticipate that if your Phoenix knowing that Gober has to roll towns throws it away Gordon is there every possession magnified it feels like boy this going to be an offensive foul on Phoenix and Devin Booker doesn't like it wants them to challenge that'll be Booker's for I think they're going to I think you're right they got got one left after they were successful early and now Vogal will inde theed challenge offensive foul the call against Booker who initiated here in Minneapolis it's an unsuccessful challenge by Frank vogle the hooking call an offensive foul against Devin Booker stands his fourth so they lose a timeout and now Phoenix G has one timeout left with 955 left and no challenge as well and and that's a tough one I I thought the right call there in terms of the foul and now if you're Phoenix well you got to lock in defensively and you still got to make sure you can control that defensive backboard Mike Conley Jr again running that pick and roll action Gobert going no look to Towns how about the Freshman a little mustard on that pass this place has come alive a Target Center a fan base that is stared for postseason success Bradley Beal against Conley trying to create some space one to shoot he fires missed it yeah that that's just not very good offense there just too stagnant and really not giving yourself an opportunity to put Minnesota in rotation so we hit the 9-minute mark McDaniels weak side he's been huge tonight offensive rebound cudley speaking of Huges and again the ability to run that pick and roll and put Phoenix in rotation creat the offensive rebound opportunity and Conley with the dagger Devin Booker short McDaniels has he and right now the suns are on the ropes still plenty of time left but a 70 run for Minnesota and without your best player on the floor and Anthony Edwards so impressive here what the Timberwolves have been able to do McDaniel slithers in as they punch him in the mouth again biggest lead tonight and it's a phoenix turnover and the frustrations now starting to set in for Phoenix but you've got to give this Minnesota team a tremendous amount of credit dealt with all the adversity in that first half the foul trouble and may have come out here and controlled this game here in the second remember Minnesota was down a point at halftime McDaniels keeps on coming the bottom has just fallen out from beneath the Suns meim next here on TNT League's leading score Luca Don trying to get the Mavs even with the Clippers and that is kawh Leonard and he is in the starting lineup for game two Clippers leading one game to none let us get you back to Target spir all right Ernie so big news for the Clippers kawi Leonard is back and we will be watching later tonight that is yous beautiful roll to the basket and that ends an 110 run G by Minnesota well they needed that and listen plenty of time here if your p is to get back in it but you need to be really disciplined defensively Gobert double team towns beautiful move under control and then he throw it away Durant to steal up the floor bounces to cler in the corner underneath eub Banks beautiful Spin and again unable to finish in tight yeah that not a good decision he had to ramp for an easy layup but he just dropped it off and Ant-Man makes some pay with that triple in transition boy that's a killer sequence for Phoenix a fivepoint swing they missed the layup on one end and Edwards with a three Gordon from Deep that's a three that was huge there because it was looking like they were starting to lose connection here 15 points still doable if you can string together stops Gordon and Eubanks giving them significant minutes off the bench Edwards misses and then Beal getting the attention of chiv and Edwards is called for the offensive bow that's about as late a call as you're going to get but I think it was a right one looked like Anthony Edwards after he went up watch that left arm just comes down right there and and the reason you call that is because it affects the point that's that's the thinking in terms of the officiating there it took Beal out of the play where he couldn't go after that defensive rebound well that couldn't have felt good if you're deal remember he had that nasal fracture in January played with a face mask for a while as be trying to fend off McDaniels all that length he's got to deal with goes off glass and he missed yeah and you're just not going to be successful taking tough contested shoes like that you need a little more ball movement if your Phoenix Chris pinch taking a timeout to try to get his team reset they're up 15 on TNT Peak upcoming National Playoff schedule double header tomorrow at TNT and True TV couple of game twos heat Celtics pelicans and the Thunder what a series that is expected to be with OKC up 10 nba.com or the NBA app so 15-point Minnesota lead 604 to play as we come up on the Midway Point GA of this fourth quarter Phoenix looked like they were gassed for long stretches of that third quarter remember no Grayson Allen he can't overstate the importance of his absence re agravated that right ankle injury late first half guy who gave them some balance such a top heavy team with their three stars no question about it and with this group it's such a tough match up because of the size and athleticism of Minnesota Conley misses a floater quick Outlet by EU Banks Here Comes Booker boy the hesitation that'll be a goal tend against McDaniels so just like that they cut it to 13 Booker's got 20 with 548 left and if you're Chris smch you can live with Misses but you cannot live with a lack of floor balance where you don't get back in transition Conley again walking running that pick and roll action resets to Edwards Edwards if you just joined this is three of 11 shooting tonight 15 points he's been better since halftime bending off field and he threw it away but Booker had to save it right into the arms of Alexander Walker and then they give it right back Gobert this will be on Eubanks and Rudy Gobert is going to shoot two and you know it's interesting the shot clock reset right now but here just a great job by Mike Conley to keep that ball in play seeming didn't like the call but I thought they grabbed possession when they tried to save that cuz he grabbed it he had complete control of that ball as he was going out of bounds n Alexander Walker didn't realize that the shot clock had reset so Vogal extending that conversation now with Zach Zara every Point looms so large here down the stretch that margin for error just minuscule right now for the Suns as Conley extends this to a 14-point lead five and change left in regulation and now Gobert is going to shoot two for Minnesota and and I cannot overstate you touched upon it not just the loss of Grayson Allen but the lack of trust in what's left on that bench because there's a a level of fatigue that you can see these games get really physical especially when you have to battle against the size of Minnesota and it wears on you the NBA on TNT is brought to you by Roundup this stuff works and by the Wendy cinnabun pull aart a sweet start to your day only at participating us Wendy's a Timberwolves franchise again that has won two playoff series in their history both of them coming in the playoffs yeah got to the conference final remember that team going back to kg and S Wy zerak who's in the house tonight here's Beal shot clock at five Booker new Banks turn back by go a bottle up at Wards Conley swings into the corner McDaniels what a night he's putting together 25 on the big stage and they Phoenix had to extend with that double team on the opposite side of the floor great job of rotating it for the wide open triple quick basket and answer by Gordon boy you consider the stakes one of the biggest nights of 20 three-year-old Jaden McDaniel's career remember he missed the first round Series against Denver last year how different does he make this team Conley little bit short Durant's got it a little quick on that trigger there if you're Minnesota you literally just want to make sure you use the entire clock here Kevin Durant has been quiet down the stretch cuts it to 15 and a quick timeout taken 353 left as everyone Kart Anthony-Townsches their breath on TNT W zerak in the house here at Target Center shades of that 034 team there's your score you can watch hit shows like up in Adams and run it back with the fandu Plus app available for free on Roku Amazon Fire and Apple TV connected devices always good to see Mr Z no doubt about it he loving what he's seeing here tonight also enjoyed that Nick Sixers game last night he was in New York what a scene that was down the stretch do the Suns have one last push here inside of four minutes here comes Edwards this has been his moments not that time as his struggles continue he's going three of 12 shooting Booker nearly traveled maintain the pivot foot Durant around the screen contact couldn't hit but he's going to shoot two I tell you what Durant will get a couple free throws here but you got to give Minnesota a tremendous amount of credit for their game plan Chris fin been understanding how they wanted to attack Phoenix defensively and they have been able to limit the big three from the Suns other games all in the NBA app stay up to the action with realtime highlights scor stats and behind the scenes download the NBA app powered by Microsoft Suns team GA 49 wins jury still out on whether this can work with the roster makeup they bring Bradley deal in such a topheavy roster well you know the the thing is I don't mind it being topheavy as long as the ancillary Parts compliment you know if you're going to have three guys that are perimeter oriented the way they have you've got to have some girth some athleticism and some toughness along that front line with your other guys and that's some of the areas where they struggle you look at the fact that all three guys in essence have been inefficient and you know it's not about their ability to make shots though it's about fenix's ability to create quality shots the shot selection has been really challenging so many of what they get is contested because of how good this Minnesota team is defensively for what a pass Edwards Gobert couldn't finish Gobert says he was hit no whistle so we cross the 3-minute mark Phoenix with possession they're at a 14-point hole the ranch try to fend off McDaniels and this is going to be a reach in here on McDaniels shot clock was down to nine and not a bad foul though listen you you you got one to give up force them to have to take it out on the sideline allow yourselves to reset your defense it's only their second team fou that's the other thing they're so good number one defensive rating team but they haven't fouled tonight Gordon from Deep little bit short the tip Nurkic it doesn't go in the rebound Minnesota boy Booker is bumped this will be the fifth as Booker is called and some join yeah it it's frustration right there you see Booker just still competing playing hard trying to force a turnover there and kind of slipped and creates that foul so 14 foul against Phoenix as we come up on the final two minutes on the perimeter it's Alexander Walker chiseling his way to the wreck and contact and just another example of because of Anthony edwards's presence he forces you as Devin Booker fouls out there that's his sixth foul you have to load to Anthony Edwards and when he makes a pass that creates an advantage like he did there it just puts too much pressure on that back line from the Suns so Booker is done you watch that you see Booker's having to run in close close out and that close out creates the opportunity for Alexander Walker to attack in a beautiful finish there through traffic looks like Frank boo is uh waving the white towel along with all these fans here in Minneapolis Okogie checks into the game as does b b nasier little as Frank Fogle going to start to clear that bench 27 left so this thing will head to the desert with Minnesota holding a 20 lead they're going to hold serve with games three and four Friday and Sunday in Phoenix now this last two minutes in 12 seconds is really important for Phoenix cuz right now Frank Bogle is trying to find out who else can I rely on off my bench so these guys coming into the game if if you're B if you're a k nir little you want to show that you can come in and have an impact because down 20 adjustments are going to have to be made by the Suns David Rody has also checked into the game acquired in that deadline deal from Memphis Eubanks underneath over the top of do and he misses and now Chris frch is going to take a timeout to empty his bench boy what a response by Minnesota they were down one at halftime but they put one on the chin of the Suns down the stretch welcome back well the Minnesota temple wolves proved all season they were the best defensive team in our league how about forcing 31 points off of 20 Phoenix Suns turnovers and it was their defense that set the tone made the difference in this game Jade McDaniels Sensational as they had other guys step up on a night that you know we haven't seen vintage Anthony Edwards Karl Anthony-Towns the foul trouble in the first half just didn't matter down the stretch but what you saw was Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony-Towns impact winning and understanding that it wasn't about their stats it was about their impact and they made the play that were presented for them and that's why this team takes a two lead as they're going to get ready to head to the desert you sometimes you see a young player try to shoot his way out of struggles we didn't see that Anthony Edwards tonight didn't force anything GH has stayed within the confines of their offense and that goes to the maturity of how quickly he's been able to mature at this level now a guy who's still again just 22 years of age it's a big building block win from Minnesota and don't discount the had from Karl Anthony-Towns as well SP because he also listen really difficult pick up three fouls he's set for about nine straight minutes in that first half but he had a tremendous impact in that third quarter with his decision making and playmaking as the little knocks down a triple and like I said earlier like Frank Bogle right now is trying to figure out okay what adjustments can we make who else on our roster can we get right now he's looking for Middle relievers he's looking for guys that can up some minutes so his team can be pressur down the stretch TJ Warren into the game the former Phoenix Sun three-pointer that time no B Bowl able to track down the Miss on the Baseline here's Wendell Moore Jr on a Miss three this is little came into the league as a Portland Trail Blazer turnaround fade in front of that Minnesota bench so 23 seconds left these two teams will quickly begin preparation for game three but a lot to figure out for Frank Fogle and Phoenix yeah but listen he's got one advantage you've got three of the best players in our league so this series far from over Minnesota takes the Whistle the turnover there 1.5 and that's going to do it little with the heave as Minnesota hold serve and they win it with a convincing second half performance down the stretch 105 to 93 as they head to Phoenix with a 20 series lead we'll break we'll have the second half of our TNT playoff double header next when we send you to La for the Clippers and the Mavericks
