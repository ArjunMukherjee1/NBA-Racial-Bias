pass great for movement aim mura Luka deep straight away triple up and out and the rebound to Collins well in La they started out with lobs to Hayes Jazz really prepared for that that time Luka is now one of eight as a Laker from downtown he was one of seven on Monday misses his first triple tonight as Collins goes Corner three Austin Reaves a young young Talent out of Oklahoma undrafted wide open just a breakdown defensively Walker just was a little flat footed and surprised he had no Frontline help well yeah it's tough for him to get a little off on help side and get back to the position and hey just had to step on him John Collins crosscourt to Collins LeBron watch out so dangerous on a downhill run three jazz players collapse forces the turnover and Markkanen and swings it into front port to Coler here's Collins little bounce pass John Collins had a jumper gave it away back inside Walker one boun puts it down over Hachimura beautiful maybe the best power dribble into the D I seen Walker Kessler have this season that's a great start for him Walker number one in the NBA in field goal percentage at 71% Hachimura Corner three up and in Rui had 21 points three triples against the jazz on Monday night and he is dangerous 43% from downtown this season John Collins on the roll inside Walker's done a marvelous job giving the Jazz second opportun this year that shot in and out rebound Doncic we always talk about the scoring of luga just his vision is unbelievable him finding Hachimura on the play before ball that D LeBron 40 years of age ball knocked down by Markkanen and Collier there defensively out front DOD it's three over for two tonight John Collins Glides into front court they'll try triple that's the John Collins we want started that way against the Clippers been doing the nice job in that starting line as LeBron answers with his own doesn't take long after that made bucket the Lakers pushed it and pushed in a hurry and LeBron knocks down to three here's another triple by the Jazz up and out Austin breze with a rebound Lakers early 85 they've won six in a row 10 of 11 Hachimura free throw line jumper straight away good T turn the six game winning streak Hachimura that below by almost missed it it was so fast link Isaiah gone well still Hachimura averaged 20 points in the six winning streak icely D John Collins defensively swats that shot away from Austin Reaves Jazz down by three Clarkson controls the handle against Luka Inside Out Walker's there reverse it put it down beautiful move John Collins the assist and Kessler with two two buckets early not many other guys in the league that creative more creative than Jordan Clarks he just does a nice job and finding Kessler ball Tapped Out Uzi on the other end that's the unselfishness of one Isaiah klier assists are important to him and he's just done such a good job leading all rookies obviously and assists but Jazz defense coming up with a nice play right there 10 dimes Monday night against the Lakers already two here early in the first quarter LeBron against Markkanen in Walker jumps out on LeBron deep three is up and out John Collins right there for the rebound Jazz had the lead of 1110 clarson shot swatted away quick Outlet Aima on a run to the rack and lays it home I think uh John Collins actually lost it as he was going up looked like a block but ball just slipped out of his hands ruri Hachimura has not missed a shot he's three for three seven points in the quarter Collins's on a stop and po jump sweet I love watching that big fell play he's got a lot in his bag he's stretching the floor for threes mid-range game he was one of three jazz players AG go double double in La Monday night game decided by 10 or less throw that out the window if you want to focus on the seven that's good they're not perfect you got to keep this game close to have a chance and X factors I'm looking for some from the Jazz I'm hoping it's a guy like Bryce sensar who's been struggling with his shot not getting many um Johnny Juzang could be one as well but Jazz needs some X factors in this game nice Cut inside CL and foul 17 Mark T you made a point earlier about Luka and both LeBron playing tonight look this is their last game before the All-Star break LeBron back to San Francisco Luka is going to continue to work on his conditioning but I through that period where he's got to get comfortable with his teammates missed both free throws a surprise how the shape maybe I'm kidding CH sah on the floor the catch and shoot Markkanen  that's a good sign early threes he was one of eight Monday night in La the Jazz now have scored on six of the last seven possessions trying to make it seven of eight with Sall front Court well the defense has been spot on not perfect but good enough to give the Jazz some fast break opportunities all five starters have now scored for the Jazz Clarkson stuck on the wing guarded by Reaves here's short shot clock five down to four rolls to three inside out it comes and the rebound pulled down by Luka Doncic on the lead ins side Johnson Hayes for two Luka putting on a burst of speed right there knowing that he had numbers and had an advantage here's Keyonte in his second year out of Baylor making the most of it Off the Bench short nice rebound Markkanen back inside out sends the ball winds it up deep and again short he is now two of his last 22 from downtown yeah he just has to not be short doic with a deep triple well he's rarely short from there but Bryce sens the ball has to figure out how to get that ball in offensive end they've done a good job one a few games without him Len makes his first appearance after signing on with the Jazz former jazz man Jarred Vanderbilt also on the court here's Deonte coming up short on three V with a rebound coming up on the four-minute Mark first quarter Jake Milton shakes it inside Len pumps it down denied Walker was there the Kessler effect John Collins strolls in front Court Markkanen in deep triple got it a pure three-pointer two threes for Markkanen those are so such big plays Walker Kessler yeah he may catch a dunk every once in a while but more often than not he is going to reject that shot if you test him three blocks in the quarter 99 now on the season for Kesler one more puts him at 100 for three consecutive years coach said you know how early he's calling out coverages that he's involved in that's proves so much now the next step for him is you know not assuming things the best communicators on defense constantly point out the obvious things about coverage so he is getting better but that's the next step he wants to look for for Walker guys making strides this season in his third year ball punched out picked up by Milton Lakers with the ball 2120 with a lead the ball's a loose got away from Len sends the ball runs the floor leaves it for Mark in Miss layup got foul offensive I told him to smile after those victories that was a little one eight points in the quarter for Markkanen the Jazz with a one-point lead on the Lakers LeBron back on the floor Dalton Knecht who just came back after practicing with a Charlotte Hornets with that trade te that never went through there's a shot inside no actually a dish nice Collier finds beautiful his fellow rookie Philip palski well I've been on a few teams where guys we're on the trading block and the trade was announced and it didn't go through it's kind of an awkward situation they're trying to welcome do Knecht back into the fold he's got the triple from the corner and he hits that'll help and I think you Angeles he said they Dalton and him had spoken that morning and he had expressed his empathy and Grace to give him knowing that he'd been through a lot of emotion after that reced trade he said he's not necessarily in the rotation that was on Monday night but he did note that he would play Wednesday night so it is to be expected you know a lot of emotion just being back in the Lakers jersey during tonight's game guys Mark in fight for that rebound down low and no it's not easy to coach Superstars and it's not easy if it's LeBron and it's not easy in Los Angeles yeah and especially a guy like JJ reck with no coaching experience right I think his playing experience has helped him in a lot of ways the collapse sends a ball on LeBron was able to scoot that ball out to vand Vanderbilt Collier that catch you from Deep that's what confidence will do little by little ring that three-point shot he's up to 21% talking to threes a little Shake there by Shake Milton he's got a five-point quarter and a 3029 Laker lead and it's amazing how Isaiah Ker's confidence and everything else but his three helps his three-point shooting 45 ticks left on the first quarter clock filipowski straddles a three-point line Markkanen and takes that pass Drive scores on a nice Euro Step and Low T is off to a hot start he has scored 12 in quarter number one backside rebound by call you coach will hardy is really trying to put Lauri in a position where he can go downhill wow cutter G Markkanen and nasty angry and the assist to the rookie carer well isaah carer lost the ball Mandy almost took it from he got it right back that's just stick to itess and just sets Lauri up for a nice dunk Jazz have put 33 on the board here at Delta Center in the open quarter LeBron slides a pass into Vanderbilt got a foul whistle hand 28 so if you can stay in that 30-point range you know and your defense is good you're going to stay close in this game we even have a slight lead it's been so much better than in La you know and when you can score some of those points off good defense that's what's working for you jazzz Trail 7247 at half time Monday night big Quarter herein Two steals in a block against LA on Monday he makes two at the line he is so efficient has been all year yeah it doesn't take bad shots either I like him in isos like him stretching the floor like him in the paint and the line Austin Reaves Shake Milton back in out front deep straight away short on that three-point attempt Philipi the rebound but that pass just a bit out front of Johnny juen you don't mind those I mean that that was just a hair off but really great vision by Isaiah Collier and you're going to be as good as he's been you got to take some risks you won't win them all but you'll win most of them Jazz dis out nine you can hook right there kind of holds John off even swipes the back of his head Collins wants that ball he's got it big Blitz Collins lost the handle picks it back up works against ly he'll jump it sweet shot that net barely moved and he took on the big seven-footer and what do you do you just find some space and knock it home well they brought an extra body and that extra body just decided to go home he was left ISO with Len geves is when he gets rolling Jaz go to John Collins again Collins musles it up inside reaching out L for the rebound and LeBron will bring it into front Court watching fade away right here nobody comes playing catch with Reaves there's that step back the jump away and good that's his shot and as a Defender you kind of got to know that he's going to go into your body and go lean back as far as he can you got to stretch out as far as you can contest that shot deont three Off the Mark once again LeBron front Court Jake Milton spacing the paint he'll take it block by flip back out front Reaves Shake Milton for a triple up and out backside rebound Collier will hardy saying how Philip's next level is what you just saw great block on the defensive end Juzang three Off the Mark LeBron again run of the show sets up Reaves for three again cold tonight in Salt Lake City maybe oh that pass kicked it's about reading angles right reading angles and reading space giving yourself enough time to make those plays and he he came with a lot of that now he's sharpening the night got a travel think he's walking up n that'll bring one down to him come on put it on the Laker tab what do you think somebody's paying for it here's LeBron that sweet spot against Collins same shot little wiggle now goes Baseline quickly flip left his feet LeBron checks in number seven 27 points a game stolen Reaves Juzang never saw him coming and he flies in for his first bucket re had misses first six yeah Reaves looking for something to get his offense going and it usually is defense that can help in that area flip from the Corner up and out and one and out for the Jazz LeBron once again out front runs the show Collins stares him down he'll take a jumper out tapped up picked up Collins Scoops a little pass off to juay gets it back he'll drive inside and Tra fifth turnover for the Jazz three for the Lakers Dalton Knecht on the floor with Reaves now Shake Milton working against Cody Williams the 10th pick out of Colorado on the floor here in the first half see showing Luka hands it back Reaves trying to turn the corner on filipowski Doncic crosscourt Milton for three Tapped Out by flip but the Lakers retrieve it Luka paint inside swings it in yeah you cannot reach on LCA you got to figure out a way to get laterally over in front of him make him change his direction or shot Stillman by Doncic off that pass from filipowski ja get back two defensively Lukas steps back behind the three gave that shot back to Reaves he'll drive inside off the glass and draws a foul with a thunder Detroit will be the last game of that n game home stand I think everybody's excited about that schedule except my wife I might be home a little too long but Luka strling that three-point line Reaves bounces inside out Hachimura good contest there by Johnny Juzang on Hachimura Koloko is on the floor tapped that ball kept it alive for a moment now with this group out there that ball has to move Deontay George set to inbound finds Walker Jazz down by two with the ball mark it in stops and Pops straight away three Splash you mark it in how about a 17 point half 14 in the first quarter going to welcome in jazz general manager Justin zanic who made his way up those stairs great crowd here tonight to watch the Lakers in the Jazz and Jay-Z it's great to see you I know you've got a little sigh of relief as you've halfway through the season or now more than half through the season and also what opportunities become available we are constantly looking at opportunities to improve the team um this trade deadline is a little unique with uh nice deflection Cody um it was unique because of the new apron rules and you had a lot of these teams in different salary structures so a lot of us were trying to figure out like how this was going to work and the opportunities that came to us were the ability to increase our asset base um not very you know exciting but things that we're needed to do with where we are with our team is continue to acquire more swings uh to improve this club and be on our path toward becoming Championship competitive well JY feel free to multitask while we're talking to you and you're watching the game but you're under contract as an analyst now okay no problem well my question is any time um I like to hear your thoughts I mean obviously uh the Anthony Davis Luka Doncic trade was in their own right there and you know they decided that was in their best interest um as I said before with the new apron rules apron apron 1 and apron 2 a lot of these bigger deals that you saw of primary guys moving they needed a third and fourth team not every one of them but you know the majority of them and we were involved in two of them so where we were with having some extra space and Ryan giving us great resources to use that stuff to continue to pick up things that are a benefit to the Jazz we were able to execute on it um obviously it kind of rehap if we were in the playoffs right now I'd be asking both of them like what is going on here and I'm not doing it but where we are the ability to pick up stuff basically for free um to do something that another team would have done anyway uh that's that was really sweet yes it was seg you took it yes that was really sweet I take kante was stood straight up and the Jazz get the agency being traded at that age at 25 years old um and you're talking about a global Superstar this is not just you know one of the the best players in the NBA you're talking about a guy with global reach I want to ask you about k um my last season with in the league was his dad keny Martin where you know we're just finishing up I think tomorrow's going to be five and seven nights so it's hard for him to make we want to make sure he's safe and getting on the court but we guys will see him soon um after we all start breaking we'll see what he can bring um but he fits our timeline and fits something that we don't have a lot of as I said before and we're excited to get to know well Justin it's j to see as walk goes Skyhigh and Keyonte and Isaiah both developing quickly and they're getting their teammates involved Justin I know that has to put a smile on his face absolutely anytime you know our coach has said it many many times play hard and pass and I think you're seeing a lot of glimpses of that tonight it's a nice at least in this first half bounce back from you know I think the lights and Showtime of La of of what we did two months two days ago I think it's actually a nice sign for a young team to be able to react for the Lakers just says the Jazz's defense is really on point right now they're more focused as Justin said than a couple of days ago when they were in La they're back at home and the defense is rolling LeBron's trying to change that with that deep three but the Jazz doing a great job of capitalizing on that great de nine-point first half LeBron two of three from downtown four time MVP Clarkson launches it hits John Collins with a flame Jazz have so many options on their plays the first one's not there which I thought it was Lauri at the the free toow line as LeBron answers again backto back triples LeBron is a 39% shooter Big T from downtown and yes he takes a plenty in fact six a game Mark and shows the ball drives two number 23s working against each other there's his T backat jumper off the mark picked up by Vanderbilt Jaz leading by nine but LeBron trying to bring the Lakers back inside Drive Off the Mark picked up by John Collins Jazz have a two on three three on two now as Keyonte breaks open steps back back triples up it's a good look though LeBron back to work inside pass missed it great Hustle by Walker my goodness Walker castler inside pass Lay It Up tapped it in by Collins that's just hustle I mean starting with the defense I didn't think Walker kessler was going to be able to get there neither did Vanderbilt parcker five blocks in this first half of play one on the season Luka working against W drives behind the back pass draw some moves and odds from this crowd shot clock to nine Reaves against Keyonte Hachimura he's capable he's very capable 21 points Monday three triples John Collins off balance shot takes a bounce right out to Reaves and Hachimura just has a clear path to the rack Markkanen and up slow yeah that's the tough thing about those kind of shots when everybody's packed into the paint they bounce long Lakers have a wide open fast break look half a second separating shot clock game clock here as Vanderbilt kicked that ball 13 seconds and change for Utah they can play for the final shot coach JJ reck putting some pressure on Keyonte there sending a not an allout Blitz but putting pressure on him to try to turn that ball over Jazz had seven players in double figures on Monday night three here in the first half Collins mark it in Clarkson John Collins looking for more here's Keyonte Rises up three caught it with three on the clock here in the first half seven points for Keyonte all here in the second paint protector but you can't just give him all the credit John Collins Lauri Markkanen Kyle filipowski everybody has collectively been involved in making it tough for the Lakers man that young man is just so fun to watch he's caught on quickly he he's making his 20th career start tonight he had five assists Five Points at the half drops in his seventh there's Luka off the wing and doit seems to find some comfort he's now hit seven of 11 shots you can pretty much count those good if nobody's out there when he catches it he has all the time in the world do since one to seven in his Laker debut tonight he on that last one that's just a veteran move for Isaiah Collier got a know from the Laker locker room at halftime Jaxon Hayes are starting center out for the game with a facial contusion suffered in the second quarter mark it in deep got it I'm not sure what L was thinking that's 20 for for Markkanen  yeah does he know who he's guarding he's guarding a seven-footer that has range that loves that shot Luka same spot this time short Clarkson able to grab the rebound John Collins strides past Luka in the paint contact you get him in a one-on-one situation in your Clarkson he crossed him over kind of got him misdirected and Drew the foul Reaves looks inside go Hachimura stops and Pops jumper about a 10 Foo or T and he's going to hit that shot most every time 14 points for Hachimura yeah Walker not able to get out and contested well and Hachimura loves that low Baseline shot Jazz shooting at a 50% clip overall 43% for the Lakers poo take the triple it's up short and the ball Finds Its way to Luka quick Outlet pass to LeBron it has to run back to the corner here's re puts a shoulder down on Isaiah pass that ball through traffic look at his stats I think they mean a lot till this game is over he is always always a threat cins sets his feet one and out Reaves jumps into the rebound who by the way despite having struggles with the shot dish down eight dimes in the second quarter a Mur short rebound Collier and that's good pick Let's just say High Octane and will hardy said look I think he's faster than he was a month ago no question continues to work on his conditioning to this playing time has helped him in a big big way there's a pass out to Collier he'll dribble Drive Inside Out Mark in catch release three and another dime for Isaiah Collier mark it in had dropped 23 five out of seven from downtown think about a triple double tonight team 776 was doable for Isaiah at this point travel here yeah his feet just kind of slid still on Doncic back to work here's Reaves they switch now Walker out front John Collins picks up Doncic swings it out LeBron the triples away and good that's just good Vision by Luka he knew where everyone was even before he made that move LeBron had a couple of late John Collins travel gives the Lakers the ball back Jazz with a lead of 7466 John Collins little touch on the shoulder now Luka puts a left hand on him how about that behind the back pass Reaves three going in this half just his second shot made tonight two of nine in his first triple one out of seven is re here's John Collin from the corner that b just this game was a lot more responsibility than he had in Atlanta to do more things as the Lakers turn it over here miscommunication between Luka and Reaves Collier hands it off to Clarkson how about that little scoop come up short with a tap in oh boy well Jordan knew that was short when it rolled off his fingers what the first one to it Mar touch down Luka Baseline out front LeBron he'll take the three short rebound right into the hands of Clarkson there he working his magic against Hachimura to the left up off the class the REM in Kadabra bowler one two three Houdini 2.0 continues a 70 run by the Jazz and how about Utah tonight they flipped the switch on the paint they got a 36 advantage on the Lakers I think Jordan just mesmerizes the defense on those dribbles looking shot Ricochet is out it is so hard to tell what Jordan is going to do by the time you figure it out that right there happens tie off the window over Alex Len Clarkson putting on a show here in quarter number three aim Murray gave up the Triple Collins Runs Out here's dodes Walker got back puts a body on it going to draw a foul and put has the last couple games he's started as well guys seventh start for Jordan Clarkson this year mostly Off the Bench won that sixthman award when Joe Ingles was alongside John Collins with a muscle move around Len iy strong nice little Delayed Action takes the bump really kind of shoots on the way down cin has hit five of nine shots 15 points wter Collier faces up Reaves count that that ball is on the downward flight and John Collins got a piece of it so Reaves into double figures with 11 8571 Jazz by 14 out front Keyonte three bang great baller back pass Jordan Parkson made a great block right there by John turns into two wow you're not in the third yeah the defense has just really been steady and consistent

a 40 Point third quarter for the being faster now well he had to learn the speed of the game at this level you know at USC he was he was high paced but it's a whole different animal here in the association passes off to Collins seven on the shot under a minute to go here in the third damic scoring and defensive performance by the Jazz tap down picked up for a moment by kacha mura has it front Court looks over the top Knecht try to put it down LeBron will finish in Oklahoma City will start things off February 21st right here at home s straight after tomorrow night at Delta Center Walker Kesler getting a much needed rest for that fourth quarter coming up but they're putting a lot of pressure on the point guards now tough pass One Touch to Johnny tuen triple missed it Vanderbilt's got it ball deflected Keyonte he's blind spot LeBron will baseball pass it to half court in the house of Larry Miller built Delta Center Jazz out scored the Lakers 40-3 in the third quarter also to the paint a 20 to6 advantage in the third JB in the truck reminds me the first one in 16 years by the way for Clarkson could be time Collier now once again in R figures with 10 you see a lot of Threes go up with the Lakers here Reaves pushes one inside the Lakers have a in fact the only Jazz rookie with a triple double big Mark Eaton 1983 just a two- on 12 points 12 blocks 14

go paint little pocket pass Collins in a traffic picks it up there any question about his energy Walker called for the ball he's got to put it down oh beautiful another $50 donation from new Utah for stores to the Utah Food Bank making a local difference it's buil for proud he is so good on that little roll the rim he picks and then rolls to Loco pretty well tonight Toco makes two at the line 11194 see this is the time too where will Hardy has spoken so many times this year okay you got the lead not can you win short shot clock Mar and has to rush it Koloko the rebound finds LeBron ja can get better looks than that I think the the guards really have to initiate that draw and kick Reaves step back up against Cody Williams ball Tapped Out picked up by Knecht deflected cody Williams nice job on the defensive side now drives inside finger rolls it seven-point game Cody Williams in nine minutes he's hit all four free throws Koloko tried to put it down with one hand Walker took it away Keyonte the trailer to John Collins leans in triple yeah flame needs to have to win a game like this and I know it's not over but man what an impact Lauri has had on this game all the way through well JJ reck has emptied the bench Shake Milton scores his seventh point of the game bronny James on the floor Mar Morris as well there's a rebound pulled in by Goodwin bronny gets around of Applause to see him for the first time as a pro here in Sal Lake yeah those part-time Laker fans in the re Che for him to score marke Morris long time vet from Kansas Brony misses in the rebound to Walker seven rebounds for kesser 16 points5 block shots might have to put his former teammate Isaiah  Collier  in to make sure he doesn't get a shot off two hand Hammer over Len take back Mark it in with a nice nice game he's busted out inside out 28 for Lauri inside Len banked in two the Big T Alex Len after an 0 for three start scores his first two and then Mark and I mean just left alone took it home and Markkanen now has 30 in his pocket and Keyonte George his ninth assist of the night turn around shot down it goes so Shake Milton that's Lauri fourth 30-point game this season and his first since January 7th Keyonte three I knew that was good as that ball was coming out to Keyonte in Rhythm catch and shoot he loves those kind of passes 18 for George the Jazz have now hit 14 of 37 from three there was a six block for Walker Kessler Ronny James high floater missed it but a foul five minutes left Clippers tomorrow night Clarkson into the paint he was fouled on that drive and see if there's a reason why as Markkanen continues to punish the rim there's a reason why Walker leads the league in field goal percentage he went eight for eight tonight 71% when the night started Markkanen now with 32 with double figure assist with 10 connecting with Lauri looking alongside Keyonte those two have combined for 19 of the Jazz 30 assists in this game amazing Juzang working against the vet

of hours on the floor and to beat the Lakers at home and you said it well this team was full basically full force tonight the Jazz missing seon but really both teams brought it and that's how you want it right you you want the other team to be healthy especially with LCA and LeBron playing um but when the Jazz are healthy it's a mixture of veterans with the energy and the young players developing on the Fly it's a really nice game Philip palsky did a great job putting the pressure on bronny James but that is one tough three it's a tough shot that James just put down and this game taking taking it down to the final seconds there we go LeBron will take his way to the lock
