that is Desmond Bane another player that did not play a lot last year only played in 42 games a lot of back problems for Bane a year ago he looks good early in this season Caldwell Pope 4 three Morant with the rebound for the Grizzlies Jalen Suggs draws that match up no surprise there the three is no good the run out by Suggs Morant is there and Suggs in trouble kicks it out to Caldwell Pope that's traveling it's a great job by in getting back on defense did a nice job uh of really cutting off Jalen Suggs off the outlet from Franz Wagner Desmond Bane a pick and roll with Jackson 15t floater is good hereon Jackson Jr a four nothing start for Memphis outscored last night 128 to 10 108 Alo benero that will be a foul on Jackson holding Wendell Carter Jr Daren Jackson Jr last year against the magic had a 30o game in the January Victory against Orlando very talented seventh year player out of Michigan State vrow is picked up by Edey Franz Wagner Marcus Smart knocked it away off of Wagner out of bounds terrific Defender Marcus Smart did not play a lot last year as well here comes Memphis the other way Wendell Carter Jr the rebound Caldwell Pope attacking the rim could not connect outstanding defense Again by smart Desmond Bane drops it off to Edey and that's where Jamal Mosley said Zach Edey is a problem he's always going to be around the rim and just that help side those opportunities for him will be there on the Drives By Bane and Morant and another magic turnover not a good start for Orlando tonight have yet to score that's three turnovers already for the magic cannot give up possessions to this Memphis team they are a very good offensive team Daren Jackson well he is a strong inside Force for Memphis an Ain nothing run to start the game for the Grizzlies Jalen Suggs B Caro back to Suggs his three is no good and it's going to be another foul against Memphis trying to keep Carter off the offensive glass Wendell doing a great job of working the offensive glass again much as he's done in the first two games really creating problems in there two fouls now the Grizzlies pick up trying to keep him off the glass at 14 rebounds against Miami 11 against Brooklyn last night Bano so strong beautiful finish with the left so strong and so quick by Jaren Jackson in a wink of an eye just quick explosive move Magic's first points for the night Jackson backing in too strong Edey an offensive rebound but a whistle and that fou is going to be on Edey pushing Wendell Carter in the back Wendell doing a good job getting that inside position moving in back so what is that two on Edey now in his first game David he fouled out in about 14 15 minutes I think yeah that's right he'll get an early seat Taylor Jenkins inserts Brandon Clarke into the lineup an 8 to2 lead for the Memphis Grizzlies Suggs using the screen from ban Caro Grizzlies have really struggled rebounding the basketball Suggs knocked it away from Morant he goes kening out of bounds so does the basketball Memphis will keep possession it's interesting David I saw that struggling rebounding the basketball for so long when this team was healthy they led the league and rebounding they got out they ran fast breaks points off turnovers they are healthy now and hopefully for them for Taylor Jenkins can play the way they want to play Durant inbounds at Demarcus smart kcp guarding smart strips it away down low with the steal kcp Wagner side steps floats it no good offensive rebound B Cara fouled from behind jar they got Jaren Jackson Jr for his second foul of the game Watch the job the defensive job by kcp those quick hands that'll be a block shot and Taylor Jenkins is going to challenge this foul call all right so an early first quarter challenge for the

an advantage on the glass now David got to take advantage of that Edey and Jaren Jackson both in foul trouble here early last night band Caro made six of 11 free throws splits the pair that time Marcus Smart Way Off rebound Ricochet is around and is taken by the magic but out of bounds off of Carter Brandon Clarke able to get a hand in there and kind of knock that one away so it'll be a clock reset 14 seconds on the shot clock inbounds pass comes to Brandon Clarke and the foul boy an easy bucket magic caught out of position the foul is on Wendell Carter Jr Brandon Clarke goes to the line not really sure what was going on there David it almost like the magic trying to Zone in on that under out of bounds nobody really had a had their eye on Brandon Clarke just slipped in very easily into the middle of the paint three-point play for Clarke and eight-point lead for Memphis we played almost four minutes in the first quarter home opener for the Grizzlies magic have played three consecutive home openers now Miami their own and now the Grizzlies vano against Aldama lost the dribble gets it back Suggs with a shot clock ticking down Caldwell Pope three-point shot it's good give him two just inside the ark yeah good challenge by Clarke forced him to step in a foot on that into the two first basket for kcp Aldama running hook very talented scorer Aldama good size good length very aggressive play at 27 in their opener Aldama long three Jalen Suggs much needed long ball for the magic to cut the lead to five Markus smart downhill run throws it in and this grizzly team is at full speed they can get into the paint and they love to attack the rim and get to the line brog Wagner bumped off course Morant with a dangerous pass turned it over Sun Scoops it up gives to Franz Wagner pitch out to Banchero top of the Ark short good Tap Out by Wagner vano again muscles it in to Clarke and draws the foul it'll be on Brandon Clarke his first it will send ban Caro back to the free throw line love the activity by this magic team getting Second Chance opportunity Fran's able to tip that one back out and Paolo from the center of the floor just in attack mode getting into the body of Clarke follow Banchero 17 free throw attempts in the first two games of the season and already has been to the line a couple of times tonight Jaylen Wells has checked in for Memphis a rookie out of Washington state Scotty Pippen Jr also on the floor for the Grizzlies van C cuts the lead back to five again magic in the bonus early got to continue to attack that Rim kcp now defending Desmond Bane here's Pippen Park shot clock at seven Clarke three-point shot Aldama rebound Wendell Carter Jr Wagner side stepping cross pass stolen a great play by Bane pip in to Wells Wells floats it

time five turnovers now for the magic Pippen takes it gets into the lane crosscourt pass to Wells got it for three Jaylen Wells very good three-point shooter in college at Washington State and the magic turn it over again bronze had spun to the rim and Paolo saw that but br's coming back to cutting off his turn and that one just a little miscommunication sailed over his head that's now six turnovers in the first quarter for the magic Memphis has only committed one seven of memphis's points have come off turnover they try to get more and they do Aldama a 10-point lead for the Grizzlies nine points off turnover of their 20 sus B Caro for three in and out Carter offensive rebound shovels it to Vana his shot is good what a nice job Wendell working that glass P he is a load down there that is a big Second Chance opportunity and a score Suggs the steel Suggs the drive the step through and he lays it in j s effort points David so good on the glass get a steal get it and going in transition oh he gambled that time and pien took advantage Pippen Jr a nice back cut y excellent read by Pippen Jr on the overplay by Suggs 8o game B Caro the Suggs turns the corner against Pippen short Jumper in and out rebound par Scotty Pippen Jr Suggs all over it Pippen backs it out Aldama three-point shot good again seven for Santi Aldama and 11-point lead for Memphis timeout magic see the magic and the Memphis Grizzlies it's an 11-point lead for Memphis 405 to play in the first quarter let's take a look at tonight's Orlando International Airport around the NBA teams east and west off to a a good start first year head coach former magic Sharpshooter JJ renick has the Lakers off to a two- nothing start thanks in large part to a great play by Davis and the Celtics look very strong the defending NBA champs led by Jason Tatum averaging over 127 points a game and look at that field goal percentage in two games 6 % from the field think he's got a little motivation from the summer David I think so black has checked into the game along with Gary Harris black into the middle tough shot but a beautiful play by Wendell Carter Jr that might have been a pass well either way AB did a nice job of seeing that the defender left Wendell just got to get it up on the glass free run for Wendell that's two offensive rebounds now for him the magic with nine second chance points here early Wells got to fire a two-point attempt it's rebounded by Carter Wendell already in the first quarter six rebounds black putting pressure on again nice driving finish by black I like it get to the paint this been Grizzlies team in the first two games now granted they didn't have Jaren Jackson Jr but given up on an average 52 points a game in the paint Aldama Wells for three missed everything but an offensive rebound and then over and back as Pippen bobbles the ball now Memphis with a turnover they're third Orlando had six turnovers in about 5 minutes they've settled down a little bit since that uh shaky start with the basketball Cole has checked in seven-point game 258 to play in the first quarter black gets it back from poo Banchero he'll turn the corner and had it stripped out of bounds by Pippen out of bound off of black nice play by Scotty Pippen Jr an undrafted player out of Vanderbilt sorry about your commodor today Jeff they put up a valiant fight against the Texas Longhorns but little too much Texas today in Nashville Tennessee too many turnovers funny how these games work but if you give the other team too many possessions comes back to bite you doesn't matter what sport does it Jay Huff now handling the basketball magic player in the summer and with the G league club they turn it over Cole hurries it up the court throws it out of bounds just perilous turnover trying to keep that Tempo going but Derry Harris was not in the spot that Cole was expecting seven turnovers for the magic pipping to Huff Huff Wells nowhere to go black has him shut down Aldama with the shot clock ticking down throws it up high and no good the ball's batted to Pippen Pippen into the paint puff a three it's good he can make that good perimeter Shooters found him a home here in Memphis they average 17 points a game for the Orlando summer league team in Las Vegas Black no look past to Wagner muscles it in over Huff it's a nice job better job get into the paint make something happen take what the defense get a lot of dribbling early jayen Wells almost turned it over but gets it back H driving two-point shot and a foul University of Virginia undrafted it's a nice job two hands on the basketball going hard it's a bad foul by P just Reaching Across the chest Jay huff at the free throw line 27 years old he's had couple of stamps in the NBA with the Lakers the Wizards the Denver Nuggets he was really good for the magic summer league team shooting 62% in Las Vegas Jay Huff has six points coming off the bench their bench has outscored the magic bench 21 to4 Aaron Jackson Jr in some early foul trouble he's been on the bench a long time Ja Morant has checked back in oh B Caro rejected by Huff Morant exploding down the court SC the basket for Morant he'll have a three-point chance that's his first basket of the game well this has got a be a great sight for Taylor Jenkins D the ability to make a defensive play and change ends very quickly with Ja Morant with the ball in his hands didn't see a whole lot of that last season that's right B Caro kicked out of bounds only 44 seconds left in the quarter the biggest lead of the game 14 for the Grizzlies Cole pullup jumper over Aldama a beauty Cole first field goal for Cole Jake Laravia handles it against Black is on Morant Wells setting a screen Harris picks up Morant Morant lobs It Up Up throws it down but it will not count it is an offensive foul on Ja Morant that's big time play by Wagner right there watch him come over as morat gets into the lane takes the charge saves a bucket for the Orlando Magic by the Memphis Grizzlies final seconds of the quarter B Caro backing in against Morant he's fouled on the shot he'll go to the line with 4 seconds to play in the quarter that's foul number two on Morant foul number 12 Panero seven points leads Orlando in scoring Aldama has seven for Memphis Jay Huff Has Come Off the Bench and scored six their bench has giving them a tremendous lift David bench forced to play because of foul trouble by the starters magic were in the bonus about 6 minutes on the clock in the quarter but have not been able to take advantage of it Desmond Bane checking back in Jaylen Wells checks out of the game good stent for the rookie out of Washington state Wells and Suggs back in for Cole final possession of the quarter 4 seconds left Jamal Mosley wants Suggs on the court defensively he and Harris in the back court with Black Suggs will be matched up with Ja Mar Morant Harris making it tough half court ke by Morant is no good and it will be a 10-point Memphis Grizzlies lead after all right it's Black and Cole Jett Howard has checked in to start the second quarter Wagner Derry Harris we have not seen these five together Wagner rebounded by the Grizzlies Huff laravia lowers his shoulder Jett Howard blocked his shot but we have a foul foul number 13 power his first or first Goga Bitadze checking in for Gary Harris soaz and Wagner will be on the floor together aravia at the line a third-year player out of wake Force there comes Goga Bitadze aravia one out of two early second quarter for Memphis the magic down by 11 black to Wagner crashing into Huff lays it up no good put back in by the long arm of goab betaz got to work that glass use that size Jaren Jackson Jr has the ball blocked by Wagner they both hit the deck and we had a whistle we're going to call for the foul is it's on Wagner his second that looks like the Jaren action we saw in this building last year just bullying his way to the rim he took 30 shots for those 30 points last season in that win here by the Grizzlies Jackson knocks down the first free throw Black brings it up the floor Wagner at the three-point line Cole tried to go behind his back with it almost turned it over shot clock is at five Cole Wagner with the shot clock at one rebounded by Morant Jackson the fake and the drive Huff reverse dunk man Jay Hoff putting on a show in this first half just a great drive by Jaren Jackson Jr sets that up and when goer came to help H right there on the kick out and putting on a little something extra with that reverse Wagner the offensive putback his second field goal of the game Morant reverse blocked by Bitadze followed in by Arabia got to collapse to the level of the basketball Goga made a great defensive play but then Laravia just kept coming Cole had it taken away and then Morant kening out of control but we've got a foul let's see who's got they're going to call it on ab and they're going to say it's a take foul David okay that was the initial signal by referee Natalie SEO I think they're going to they're going to review it yep we have a transition take foul on the play but we're seeing doesn't meet the criteria for clear path call FL is a transition take file under review to see if it meets the criteria for a CLE let's get a quick word from Planet Fitness well David it looks like Wagner at the table was set to check in so we'll see but this will be a I guess two shots in the basketball yeah for the Grizzlies if this they're reviewing it now to see if it actually was a take foul all right the review continuing our crew chief tonight is James Capers here and Natalie SEO have the headsets off James Capers has the verdict follow review we have a clear path fou we will have two free throws and Memphis possession same same result instead of a take foul will be a clear path foul which I think is the right call in that situation so there will be two free throws in the basketball tough one there for the magic just not as sharp David tonight as we have seen a lot of mistakes both ends of the floor actually yeah a lot of turnovers but defensively just a lot of mistakes as well so Morant will get two free throws J had 22 points 10 assists in the season opener at Utah on Wednesday followed that up with 24 points in Houstan last night he only played in nine games last year first 25 he missed due to suspension he came back he played nine games out of 10 available games and then injured his shoulder and was out the rest of the year two-time Allstar now Memphis will inbound the ball with a 15-point lead here Bron Wagner checking in comes bronze now so the two Wagner Goga Bitadze Black and Jett Howard on the floor for the magic black is on Morant three-point shot Morant is no good Jackson saved it but into the hands of Franz Wagner Black Franz for three short rebound tring to by Huff Marcus Smart pretty pass Jaar they are changing ends very quickly on when they get their hands on the basketball jaw doing a nice job of staying nice and wide with Marcus Smart hailing the ball in the middle biggest lead of the game for Memphis Wagner nice drive he can't get it to go but he draws the foul Franz will go to the line looking for his first points of the game foul is on Jay Huff Orlando has been to the free throw line six times in the first half Memphis nine bronze had 23 in the opener in Miami followed that up with 29 against Brooklyn last night that was Wagner's first missed free throw of the air he made his first six in games one and two well this Memphis team when they are healthy there there's a lot of talent in the tough Western Conference they can stay healthy they will make a lot of noise Jackson bullies his way through Wagner that's a pretty nice move moving to his left a little Euro Step Back to the right-handed floater 18-point lead Howard Black down the middle pretty left-handed shot Here Comes Memphis boy you got to be ready they're coming right at com fast yep smart using the screen Morant sails a pass inside it's out of bounds back to Memphis rur Zach will return Jay Huff should get a round of applause from the Memphis fans did a lot of good things Den blocking shots eight points Wendell Carter and Paolo Banchero back now for the magic we have a whistle before the ball is inbounded foul number five and the foul is on ban Caro that's Jan Jackson will be shooting dead ball foul ball never came in so he will get one and they will retain possession Jackson missed the shot Memphis will keep possession Edey for three that's good Zach Edey only took two three-point field goal attempts at Purdue last year I think you got to make him make a few more before you come out and guard that that's his first in the NBA Howard misses for three laravia gets dribble penetration Jackson drives on Banchero Carter with the block but a foul boy Memphis is really Relentless and attacking the basket they're going back to the free throw line well this is the thing is Jaren Jackson has proven he can make that three so you have to close out quick that's a nice job by him catching Paolo leaning a little bit and going right by him into the paint Terrys J ter Jackson Jr a career 80% free throw shooter in his seventh year out of Michigan State selected number four in the 2018 draft returning for Grizzlies number one Grizzlies have been very deliberate about attacking the paint tonight David they've got 28 points in the paint here in the first half and they've held the magic to just 18 points wow Edey over the back almost had an offensive rebound and then the Grizzlies come up with it kept it alive there's a problem with the shot clock they'll reset it to 16 Jake Laravia a lot of credit to come up with that loose ball on that second CH opportunity for the Grizzlies Ria to Jackson Banchero tough assignment Jackson Lefty finish won't go rebound Banchero Alo aravia on a switch double teamed in a corner sug swings it to Black fakes the three Wagner open out of the corner got it for three more of that more of that terrific ball movement reading the defense take what they give to you ball fakes all started with a double team on Paolo vano Jackson for three rebound sus pitches it ahead to Wagner Wagner driving Banchero kicking it to black black to Carter way off ricochet is back to Windell Suggs on the Baseline two big men there shot clock at three get it up Carter is fouled on the shot with the shot clock at one two free throws coming for the magic is this anything last night uh the magic made a bunch of Threes right Jeff but 10 players 10 different players made at least one three for Orlando so that me wondering has that ever happened in Magic history I know when the team made 23 in Sacramento there were nine players that made at least one okay it's happened only two other times back in 2019 against Charlotte Chon Grant late in the fourth quarter became the 10th player and then over in Tampa remember Tampa the yes the co season that was fun Jordan bone gave the magic their 10 Jord different player and then last night Jen Howard was the hero to be become the 10th magic player here's an interesting nugget Jeff as you look down also 12 players have made at least one three in two different games for but that game that Jordan bone made the last three-point shot yes only one magic player did not make a three in that game you would never guess who the one who did not make a three it you wouldn't think it would be this guy forier the Human Torch the Human Torch did not make a three 10 of his teammates did y if he had made one three that night the magic would have joined just a handful of teams say every player made okay a three so is this anything that's going to be a loose foul on Desmond Bane great defense by Suggs good pressure out on the basketball giving Bane a little bit of trouble that's really good David very timely f with the last game I didn't feel like I came out very strong in the home opener last night so it was I'm still say that wanted to do better tonight it's hard to top your opening in this yeah I know you do I know you do and I think this this deserves a bell for a lot of reasons not just by the content of it but the fact that you need a bell tonight more than way all could use it magic turn it over Pippen pounded by Suggs another magic turnover and a three by Scotty Pippen Jr boy they are really making the magic pay for mistakes yeah they've been very efficient 10 turnovers have led to 177 points Alo B Careo sails it over the top Too Tall out of he got what he wanted David backing his man down he had Pippen on him they came to double team and Suggs open in the corner just a little too high on that one sailed on he but turnover number 11 for the magic grizzley's trying to cash in again Pippen turns it over Suggs Aldama is there Suggs waits for his teammates black or fumbled out of bounds by Carter you know how coach Mosley always says let's hit singles keep it as singles I feel like we're reaching a little bit on some of this these passing swinging for the fences a little too much Zach Edey missed rebound Bano hey Paolo forcing scoring and getting to the free throw line Paolo going to get a three-point chance there's a list of the makes last night 10 different players line Black knocked down his only attempt how about that one by Jett Howard had a minute into the game right in front of his father that was great wasn't it Jan Howard assistant coach for the Brooklyn Nets tandra's Corner focusing uh on that tonight we hope Scotty Pippen Jr man he's making some big plays off the pitch 18-point lead again 4 and A2 minutes to go in the first half Jalen Suggs they rebound and here they come Esmond Bane Aldama three from up top rebounded by suso Scotty Pippen Jr guarding him defensive 3 second violation and a free throw for the magic all right here's tonight's is this anything it's very good Dave no way you get a buzzer no way you get a buzzer tonight let go the truck and find out I I think I heard a bell it was a bell it was a bell hear a bell where is the truck tonight I I have no idea somewhere out there somewhere any body can find the truck let us know where it is Jay and Suggs will inbound here's Wagner spinning nice finish beautiful high off the glass switched it to that left handstanding that's what the magic have to do got get back to getting into the paint playing Magic Basketball paint touches and then get the kick outs well the Grizzlies turning it over in the half too no good but B Caro there for the rebound and the shot will not go but a foul got on Edey yep got up under the arms of Zach Edey that'll be three on E kcp from long distance bounces right down to Paolo and that's just a great read as soon as he saw Ed's arms down going right up through it Palo Bank hero back to the free throw line that's pao's eight free throw attempt of the game he's made five of them points off turnover in the first half the Grizzlies 17 the magic six well that's an 11-point advantage in a 14-point game B Caro missing again Desmond B very strong finish they're not letting the magic set up their defense they are going very quickly rebounding they're getting out running and attacking immediately they're shooting 55% from the field to Magic only 40% 32 points in a paint for the Grizzlies in the first half that is a lot yep Suggs great look from Banchero tapped up no good by Carter rebound Al they run again Bane fakes the three Bane lets it Fly for three it's short rebound Carter nine rebounds for Wendell Wagner pulls up for three he drills it great kick ahead by Paolo got to use what they're doing to us right back at him get the ball ahead and get a shot up before the defense gets settled Santi Al Zama well he's been very good off that Grizzly bench he's got nine Suggs oh boy throws it away Carter never saw it Aldama Baseline Drive Pippen Jr uncontested Jamal Mosley wants to talk it over Memphis has a 61-point first half will'll be back half there home opener coming off a 20po loss at Houstan last night the magic 2 and0 coming into the game they've got their work cut out tonight against the Grizzlies here's our keia player profile for tonight let's take a look at the number nine pick in the NBA draft 7' 4 in Zach Edey they lift him at 299 he looks like 300 to me yeah played at IMG Academy over in Bradington in four years at Purdue a two-time college Player of the Year big fella interesting nugget about Zach Edey baseball was his favorite sport he wanted to be a a pro baseball player but he just kept growing and growing Strike Zone basketball became I had same thing happened to me David I think I told you I love baseball first Bas over there some point sophomore year in high school the baseball coach said you know what comes a time when you you got to focus on one sport and that was back in the late 70s you didn't do that then so uh yeah that Strike Zone got a little bit too big made 36 left that's a pretty set up alab high low action with Jaar the lead is 20 first time in the game minute 20 left this half has not been good to the magic Suggs for three rims out again rebound Clarke long throw to Morant Morant with the catch lobs it up for Aldama that's how it's going for the Grizzlies jaw was up in the air no place to go and Aldama right there to bail him out 40 points in the paint 40 in the first half that's a good number for a lot of teams in an entire game here they come again and here comes Morant to the free throw line sggs commits a foul 47 seconds left in the half a 65o half for the Grizzlies and Morant has been a very small part of it he's played well but ran in double figures with 10 Aldama has 11 Grizzlies well balanced scoring to your point David Taylor Jenkins has used 11 players tonight and they have all scored but how many of them have made a three Franz Wagner misses for three you got your bell already rebound BYO dur no look L Clarke can't handle it look like a perfect pass Steel by Marcus Smart goodness 15 turnover just a little thing there Cron's trying to make a one-handed pass Marcus Smart all defensive player this reading that one perfectly no look bounce pass smart def finish what an assist by Ja Morant this building has not had very much success only four wins all time that's since 2001 when Memphis moved to when the Grizzlies moved to Memphis from Vancouver where they're wearing those Vancouver Grizzly white jerseys uniforms tonight in honor of season number 30 in franchise history Edey rebounds the Miss by Band car Arrow smart gives it back to Morant bought about a three now he'll reset Edey sets the screen to lob for Edey from Morant that is the easiest lob Tomar will throw tonight big fella just get it up anywhere near the rim he's able to finish that one 7 foot4 rookie Zach Edey Carter that's poked away an easy play for Bane so the magic turn it over again Morant Jaren Jackson Caldwell Pope finds himself maxed up with big Jackson that'll be Franz foul it's too late on that double team we got to go quicker can't let Jaren Jackson get that deep before you start to come and then there's a reach now one of the ways that you know when you have a team like Memphis that likes to get out and run got to make shots David that'll slow them down a little bit if they have to take it out of the net Bo the magic really struggling shooting the basketball tonight in every facet of the game whether it's in the lane their three-point shooting free throw shooting everything letting them down in this one well they've missed 30 shots so that's that's 30 misses and then you got 15 turnovers yep it's tough to win yep one out of two for Jaren Jackson the biggest lead of the night 29-point lead for Memphis Suggs Edey is there to shut the door Wagner for three got it BR has made three threes in the game thank goodness for Bron that's three of the four for the magic Ja Morant rebound Franz Wagner numbers here Jackson fell at the other end wner nice attack and earns a trip to the free throw line foul is on 0 that'll be number four on the big man 22-year-old rookie two-time college basketball player of the year at Purdue so much talk about Zach Edey a senior year will he fit in the there was a lot of people didn't think he would be a first round pick I know and and and many people question the Grizzlies for selecting him so high but he has shown particularly in the early part of the Season he's got a skill set that you can build around so what were the knocks on Edey to think that he's not a first round pick well I think the big thing is in college coach Matt payner used him as a traditional postup player a lot of his touches came with his back to the basket so we know that's not the way the NBA game is play could he be a a rim Runner a screen and roll to the basket guy he's proven that he can do those things here's the big man backs in against Carter smart with the shot clock under 10 fires over Wagner soft touch the veteran now in his 11th NBA season Marcus Smart NBA champion with Boston here is Suggs here's Caldwell Pok back to Suggs three-point shot he got it again good ball movement right there Nice Shot fake by Caldwell pop to get his man off the floor and create the rotation Marcus Smart thought about a three SG or rather B Caro knocked it Away Memphis gets it back and a foul on Caldwell Pope Bo in the first two games David the magic were winning all of those 5050 balls the ball sitting out there just a step Slow It Feels Like Tonight Desmond Bane will inbound with to play in the third quarter Memphis has dominated Desmond Bane rebounded by Wagner Suggs pick and roll another magic turnover almost Caldwell pop picked it up and then Morant from behind with the steal but a foul Memphis does not have a challenge they used their challenge early in the first quarter it was unsuccessful so they do not have another we reach from behind and foul number three on Ja Morant three-point shot Wagner well that three-point stroke looks very n work Dallas Oklahoma City they was that like a Red River back to back that's tough I don't know what to call it I like it though Marcus Smart for three Red River back to back nine points for Marcus Smart at least it's a short flight yes it is jayen Suggs Wagner another three rims out this time rebound Bane Bane a three-point shot at the other end B Desmond Bane's first three-point field goal of the game he is a an excellent three-point shooter Carter in and out rebounded by Bane the lead is back out the 26 count the basket and a foul and he can do that as well too good strength there by bane just his ability that threat from distance this hesitation and then pal gets a piece of it but Bane there to finish it up they only got 42 games out of Bane last year with injury Morant we mentioned played nine smart Marcus Smart played 20 and even Jaren Jackson Jr who was healthy for much of the Season only played 66 of a possible 82 all of those players are back at healthy here tonight cwell Pope Paolo Banchero rebounded by Brandon Clarke Jackson is denied by Carter magic rebound Wagner Morant goes for the steel doesn't get it and Banchero had it knocked Away by Brandon Clarke Out of Bounds to the mat number Al Aldama checks in you think about last season for this grizzly team all the injuries but guys got opportunities we couple of guys that they're going to count on probably GG Jackson who played well is injured Luke Canard will be coming off their bench as well very deep team when they're healthy yes they are we have a foul called on Clarke and it's his second it will send Franz Wagner to the line Franz leads the magic and scoring with 17 to the bonds is off to it a good start offensively that's his sixth free throw or fifth rather of the game and he is four for eight for beyond the three-point line Grizzlies push it even after a made free throw here's Clarke Aldama DeMarcus Smart poked Away by Caldwell pop almost he set him up knew that back cut was coming in the pass let him go and then come up with the steal B Caro to the basket and he is fouled Again by Brandon Clarke Orlando has been to the free throw line 18 times so this will be numbers 19 and 20 just so strong poo Banchero 21-year-old third year player Seattle's finest te CHR never seen J well ando's 10th free throw of the night he's made six of 10 got poke in the nose of the first half they got them both and the magic now down by 25 Bane Corner three Morant cannot connect again he has not shot the ball well from distance about the only thing he struggled with tonight you miss a entire year takes a while to get your Rhythm back on the floor with your teammates Suggs out to Wagner

better rebounds for Wendell Carter Jr Morant took a Stutter Step travel but no call then he missed the shot Caldwell po to Wagner lets another one fly short rebound Banchero slapped Away by Bane Suggs has it Bane to handsy he argues with call but hands all over Jalen Suggs magic number one in the NBA in free throw attempts per game last year and they're shooting 21 and 22 tonight now a word from Academy Sports and Outdoors 5 minutes 17 seconds to play third quarter Orlando back to within 20 need to have a solid five minutes to have a chance to pull this off in the fourth quarter long three by Bane a miss and a rebound for Suggs boy Pippen really physical couldn't take it away Suggs a little gimpy Jalen got hurt in the first couple of minutes here last year he was fouled by Pippen who is very physical on the basketball Scotty Pippen Jr you can tell he knows what his minute allotment is going to be and he is playing a very physical up iny face kind of Defense out on the perimeter he's been effective hasn't he undrafted out of Vanderbilt I know you followed oh yeah his career at Vanderbilt did you expect Scotty Pippen Jr to be an NBA player well you know David he he was a terrific college player but it's one of those things where he stayed all four years and you know typically that doesn't that doesn't get you drafted he was one of the top scorers in the SEC as a senior he knew he could score the basketball for his Good Fortune he spent his early part of his development in that Laker organization learning a lot of good lessons playing in their g-league and has bounced around and found him a home here in Memphis he has played well tonight Desmond Bane now guarded by Black Wells the ball fake and a shot for three rebound Bano sails it over the top to Suggs three-point shot a beauty here we go oh my we've got the lead down to 15 with 418 at one time in their career suited up for the Orlando Magic I know you know who which two they are yeah all the fans might not know a Miss for the Grizzlies and the re found Franz Wagner obviously Joan Howard yep playing in Orlando so did Jaren Jackson Senior flan Wagner now 12 in the quarter and the lead is down to 8370 that's the first 345 left first make for the Magic in the quarter that wasn't a three-pointer wow that five three-point makes here in the quarter this is a foul on Wendell Carter Jr magic 14 that's four team fouls so the magic are at the limit with 343 to go third quarter from Memphis Orlando has outscored the Grizzlies 27 to4 in the third Pippen rejected from behind by black Pippen only thought he had a step on Black now this is what the magic have done in the first two games come out in the third quarter pick up the defense and that has led to good offense see if they can get a turnover here wner tight defense on ban step back he just lunging and traveled he took an extra step outstanding defensive play by Franz Wagner with ability to move those feet like that with a guy like Bane coming at you Jalen Suggs brings it up the floor with the magic scrapping back into this game in the third quarter pick and roll voder and vano Suggs with the hot hand good again we've got a 10-point game with 3113 to go in the third Suggs three threes in the quarter Pippen Suggs Hounds in Pippen got it back double team trying to shoot Suggs blocks his shot and a foul on Scott threw that uh arm into the face of of black AB at the line to shoot to another solid game for Black and 10 points in games one and game two he'll get two free throws here black a 20-year-old second-year player out of the University of Arkansas just a couple of hours up the road fville west of Memphis Tennessee we have an eight-point game this was a 29-point Memphis lead early in the quarter we have an offensive foul on Franz Wagner Memphis gets it in quickly they can sense yeah the challenge coming Pippen we might have walked took an extra step y Jackson pullup floater is good that stops that drought which was 5 minutes long Wagner had it knocked away here comes Pippen drops it back to Huff three-point shot is good by Jay Hof how good has this Memphis Bench been tonight David 40 points Off the Bench Huff now in double figures with 11 he has really hurt his former team 11 points in 8 minutes Wendell Carter Jr rebound Pippen Grizzle lead is back to 13 laravia they call him for traveling trying to drive and get into the body of Black he didn't let him touch him just kind of his momentum just kept dragging that feet but foot magic expending a lot of energy to cut the lead from 29 to8 have to keep up the pressure for two minutes into the third quarter Wagner is checked in replacing Carter Paolo B Caro stti Aldama guarding it vano gets to the Baseline black swings it to sus three-point shot is a beauty four threes in the quarter for Jalen Suggs what a beautiful drive kick and the EXT ra pass from Black hocky assist for Bano here's Aldama against Paolo leaning in gives to the cutting Pippen for two what a nice cut by Scotty Pippen Jr to bail out now damah who was in trouble 12-point game Pippen crashing into black on the screen Wagner a three-point shot no good rebounded by Jackson Pippen pushing into the paint Aldama cut off by Banchero and the steel Paolo Off to the Races takes it strong to the basket and gets crushed by Jaren Jackson Jr Paolo bounces right up but he took a nasty spill this is a great job by Paolo poking this one away defense out leading to offense I think Aldama may have fouled him originally Reaching Across his arm it look like yeah but they are going to give the foul to Jackson Banchero his 12th and 13th free throws of the night we are inside of a minute to play in the quarter returning for Grizzlies number 12 still a 12-point lead Morant returns for the Grizzlies Scottie Pippen Jr man what a night for him 11 points nine assists in 17 minutes behind Ja Morant turns out to be a really good foul by Jaren Jackson Jr power just seven of 13 at the line lead is still 12 for Memphis Durant Huff boy you got to get on him he missed this time J off now two out of four pull up three heat Jack in and out looking two for one two for one and you're right he is on fire might as well that one look good yes it did Durant running some clock oneon-one here spins lost the ball then knocked away out of bounds it'll be Memphis basketball with 3.4 on the shot clock so it's just frustrating everybody Ja Morant frustrating the crowd Morant falling out of bounds no good for three rebound Wagner five on the clock Suggs wants it Suggs will drive Suggs takes a hard fall and a foul on Memphis see what Jamal Mosley has come up with Suggs looking for the ball they get it inside to Franz Wagner it trickles off the rim by 14 and cut a 29-point lead to 12 but they did it with the long ball David only two points in the paint for the Magic in a 35-point quarter very unusual but we will take it Jay Huff looking like a season NBA veteran in tonight's game he had 13 in the opener at Utah Cole in the game out to Black ravia went for the steel that opens the door for black and an easy two point ni by ad T right there he went those long arms to go around him maybe this magic bench Can provide some pop here in the fourth quarter good job by Wagner a near steal for Caldwell Pope the shot clock at seven it's Marcus Smart kcp staying in front of him and a foul is called before the shot says the official that's number two on Caldwell PO contact said Natalie SEO before he was in had gathered the ball and headed to the basket shot clock at 10 physical away from the ball it's mooger involved with Cole as well Cole's going to pick up the foul well you wonder what the discussion was at halftime if if anything was said maybe the score board was self-explanatory get these guys going you think about all the mistakes that you made in that first half as Jaar gets another one to go he's been pretty quiet tonight a couple of flashy plays Cole gets in deep tough Fade Away jumper Cole let's see what we've got technical foul on Cole he wanted a foul yep had a few too many words for the official let's see if he had an argument it's been a physical game probably not going to get that call no but you know what happens David is it's a it's a physical game for both teams and then it just wears on you after a while well we saw Scotty Pippen explode a little bit pick up a flagrant foul after some physical defensive play by the Magic's jayen Sun puff to Smart Jackson going to work against Wagner tied him up jump ball well you can anticipate Jaren Jackson Jr loves in the post to go to that left hand able to reach in there and get a piece of that one watch on the post here he comes left hand doing a good job putting that hand in there knowing where he's going with it likes to drive and finish with that left nobody touched the ball let's see if we're going to have a foul call we're going to callose foul on a jum B don't see that very often almost never 14 on the shot clock for Memphis they're up by 13 points pumped Away by Jett Howard but a foul is called Black from behind was probably a good foul Ja seemed like he had ill intentions on this one Tom Tomar back at the line he's shot six free throws tonight has knocked all six of them down 75% career free throw shooter he was questionable for tonight's game with a sore thigh Jaren Jackson Jr was questionable until game time and they both uh have looked like absolutely nothing's wrong with them that was much time Tomar missed last season to miss the home opener probably was there wasn't much question Black getting in using his size in that post he's in double figures for the third consecutive game in game number three poked away stolen by the magic Black pull up three from way up top he had two Defenders behind him and one of them got a piece out I think so yeah never saw him coming Morant kept the pivot foot down Jaren Jackson Jr now one-on-one against Wagner starts backing him in and a foul on Wagner that'll be four on morren clearly in disagreement with the call might have been a little bit of an embellishment there by Jaren Jackson but no no doubt that he put his elbow into his back and extended that forearm a little bit Memphis is in the penalty less than three minutes into the fourth quarter the Grizzlies have not been called for a foul in the fourth quarter that was number five on the magic let's get a quick word from Star Jackson two free throws a 15-point lead Orlando had it down to eight late in the third now the Grizzlies are back up by 15 her biggest lead is 29 Wagner wide open for three he got it for it's Wagner first three-pointer tonight lob over the top HFF against down a little late getting back in on defense and huff just running to the rim 15 points in 14 minutes for Jay Huff Banchero Bogner took the rebound away from huff and put it in lead down to 14 Marcus Smart picked up by Franz Wagner will shoot a three with Wagner in his face rebound kcp black on the Move he'll take a three quick three by Black here's Jackson for three and an out rebound B Caro lot of quick threes yes they are 12-point game B Caro to black black up top back to Paolo cavius Caldwell Pope sails it way off Ja Morant picked up by Caldwell Pope one-on-one they clear it out left side of the floor great job by kcp Huff for three and he bared well in the summer the magic did not retain him he signed with I think he's sending a message tonight I think he is on a mission to send that message here's the last three right before the timeout a little look over to that magic bench Navy Federal Credit Union on a mission J HFF he is a big part of what this grizzly bench has done tonight they have 49 points off the bench that is a big number it's a new career high for Hof it was 17 Caldwell pop for three two strong Scotty Pippen Jr with the rebound that magic it's the big third quarter imagine now just one of five shooting a long ball in this quarter I was just going to say the momentum has swung back in favor of the Grizzlies after Orlando had the lead down to eight Santi Aldama makes it now a 17-point game Suggs Carter for three misses short rebound Desmond Bane you can see the Grizzlies they are taking away the paint tonight and L the magicat him from the perimeter only 32 points in the paint Orlando just a little slow to the basketball there Suggs bats it out of bounds from behind it's Memphis ball with the shot clock at seven good close out that time by Carter three-point shot a beauty Aldama Santi Aldama has made a couple of three-point shots he was five of 11 in their first two games from Beyond the three-point line you think talented offensive players you mentioned 27 points in their opener against the Jazz Scotty Pippen Jr committing the foul the lead is back to 20 the magic seemed to have lost that spark got him back in the game in the third quarter short Jumper by B Caro rebounded by Jay Huff Paolo went for the steel didn't get it and here they come Desmond Bane a three-point shot is good now the lead is 23 that momentum has definitely switched lot of runs Big Time runs tonight Wagner takes it all the way to the basket Franz Wagner another 20 plus Point night that will be an offensive foul Jalen Suggs takes the charge from Scotti Pippen Jr sug slow to get up he's going to be all right J Huff checks out 18 points in 17 minutes on Seven of Nine shooting he was an all defensive first team all defense in the ACC at Virginia he was an offensive weapon in this game there's a lot of Joy going on between Suggs and a fan and then we've got a cleanup over on a one a little spil beverage along the Baseline taking care of that got to protect your beverage when you're court side heads up can't be looking at your phone NOP Bodner has it taken away by Brandon Clarke Desmond Bane a long three to far Brandon Clarke had the rebound knocked Away by Wagner bronze now takes it drives gives to carter back to Wagner now Suggs for three grizzli doing a nice job of getting back in transition keeping the magic out of that painted area force him to kick it out Al five from d downtown the match
