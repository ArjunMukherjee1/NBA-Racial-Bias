 Sports Network the home of the Grizzlies predators and Braves good evening and welcome to the excitement of the NBA Grizzly's basketball is presented by FanDuel sports book from brand new Inuit dome in Englewood California the Grizzlies wrap up the road trip as they take on the Los Angeles Clippers Clippers 18- 10 in their brand new building the Grizzlies meanwhile overall have won 11 of their last 13 and their last three on the road hello again everybody Pete prica brev Knight on hand Rob fer will join us momentarily for our Southland player Spotlight Revan I don't know that there's a guy for the Grizzlies who's making more winning plays in crunch time than Desmond Bane did it again last night in the win in Phoenix well the thing for Desmond Bane is those winning plays are not just points that he is scoring the assists he had eight assists eight rebounds in that last game against the Phoenix Suns the assist numbers are up for him but then he also is able to knock down Big Time shots he gets himself to the free throw line made big free throws in his sons game but the finishing ability for this grizzly team has been the difference this season they're not just predicated on one person finishing the basketball game Dez has been great Jaren has been great Jah has been great Desmond Bane has been carrying the torch all year and he has had to assume a different role for this grizzly team but he has been just at home in that role James Harden going back to the NBA All-Star Game for an 11th time for the Los Angeles Clippers in their last game had 17 assists against the Utah Jazz and got to the double the free throw line double digit times in the last meeting against Memphis well you're talking about one of the better creators of his own shot in the association still today one of the best with the side step jump shot to to the three-point line but he also in pick and roll as the a great job of manipulating the screen keeping a Defender just long enough to allow him to make a play whether it's to The Rolling zubac to the basket or to one of his perimeter players Norman pow has been a recipient of a lot of James Harden assists the grizzly will have to force him to be one dimensional you always say when you play against players of this caliber you can't allow them to affect all facets of the game so see if they can make him onedimensional and the biggest Dimension is not sending him to the free throw line double digit times exactly Grizzy 7 one on the second night of a backto back they will be without Vince Williams Jr they will also be without Ja Morant we'll continue our preview of tonight's game after this time out it's the Pinnacle effective advice of the game when we return to Englewood on FanDuel Sports network grizzli is wrapping up the free Allstar portion of the schedule tonight here at the brand new in dome in Englewood time now for the Pinnacle effective advice of the game P Financial Partners play hard Bank easy Brevin you want to you want to keep this Clipper team in their Lane yeah only allow them to do what they do you can't allow anything extraordinary they only allow 12 make 12 threes a game you don't want to allow that to be more they're not a great rebounding team so don't give them the second chance opportunities both teams are prone to turnovers yeah it's the one to kill his heel for both of these teams they average right around 16 turnovers a game which one will be able to force the turnovers and then get out and score and for the Grizzlies if they happen to commit the turnovers can they not allow the Clippers to exploit them and break opportunities but the Grizzlies have done a fantastic job all year of being able to create more possessions and the way that they'll be able to create them here tonight is being active with their hands creating those turnovers getting out and running and more times than not when they do that success is on the grizzly side first meeting Clippers were plus 14 in points off turnovers and they won the first match up 114 to 110 that's the Pinnacle effective advice of the game what we come back the starting lineups and the opening tip from La griz's their first ever visit to in dome in Englewood not all that far from The Forum not FedEx forum little fabulous form uh let's get the starting lineups for tonight's game presented by Ortho South Grizzlies 36 and 17 two seed in the west Luke Kennard gets his seventh start of the season with Desmond Bane Jaylen Wells Jaren Jackson Jr and Zach Edey the rookie out of Purdue for head coach Taylor Jenkins Grizzlies glittering record despite losing the second most games to injury Clippers James Harden Chris Dunn Norman pal having a career year Kawhi Leonard appearing in just his 15th game this season Ivica Zubac for head coach teron Lou is Fifth Season here with the Clippers let's go downstairs a Robin Hood sideline report from Rob Fisher well big match up tonight with the Grizzlies and the Clippers you got the number one scoring offense in the league going against the number two defense in the league Luke Kennard who's in the starting lineup tonight for the Grizzlies with Ja Morant out he said everybody's getting a piece of the offense that's when we're moving the ball and everybody gets a good look He said Each guy is going to have an opportunity to make a play and go score baskets in different ways he said if somebody gets it going and opens it up for other guys that's the offense we've been playing everybody's involved and everybody's moving and sharing the ball well that's what we're really getting good looks out of it well the Grizzlies have been getting good looks and scoring a lot of points they've won 11 of their last 13 games and five of their last six on the road all right let's quickly get the Life Care injury report no johnar no Vince Williams Jr both with sore knees tonight Marvin Bagley will be out till after the All-Star break Eubanks sprained his left ankle in the last game Ben Simmons has been signed but returned to competition reconditioning so he's not active tonight brevan is you all know we have three officials and he SOA on time they have been assigned by the NBA Kevin Cutler 15th season 12 playoff games Scott tworowski 14th season two playoff games Derk Richards in 28th season and has worked the playoffs as well glad you're with us as the Grizzlies wrap up this portion of their schedule game 54 of 82 Grizzlies coming off a win at Phoenix last night got out to a big lead and we're able to protect it down the stretch Kennard beats Edey and he has a block taken away by Harden harden a look ahead to Zubac he bobbles but eventually gets it back one of the things that James Harden does get a lot of talk respect for is the defensive Mobility good block there by jar done was rejected by Jaren he'll try again shot clock down to four Harden with a floater in the lane puts it up an in James Harden averaging 21 a half a game had a monster assist game 23 with 17 feeds in a Saturday night win in his building over Utah 13 to 110 Jaren can't respond and there's the rebound to harden pal a career year shooting the three ball that's around it out it's boarded by Edey you see in this starting lineup they go with James Haren defending Jaren Jackson Jr because the lower base he likes to get low and use the physicality against bigger players Kennard has his pocket pick by Dunn and this will be easy and we talked about turnovers both these teams susceptible to turnovers but the Grizzlies in the first meeting which they lost 114 to 110 in Memphis on December 23rd they gave up 31 points off turnovers way too many yeah and both of these teams live on forcing turnovers and we talked about not allowing anything to be extraordinary can't allow that type of number here in this game Wells a topside three comes up well short Wells had eight last night in the victory over Phoenix rppers 29 and 23 on the season they have won three of their last five here at into Dome Harden heading back to his 11th allstar game and Jaren Jackson Jr picks up his first foul what James Harden does such a great job is when he feels you on his hip as he drives to the basket he puts arm straight into you you see here with dun the one thing that he is exceptional is the defensive side you want to force him to have to be a perimeter shooter on the other end but defensively you always have to be aware of him around the basketball done top 10 in Steels per game Harden to the free throw line where he is an 89% free throw shooter and the Clippers this year are unbeaten when he gets to the free throw line 10 or more times and that included the game in Memphis at an early timeout taken by Taylor Jenkins five straight by the Clippers to open the scoring one more free throw coming for James Harden when we return 5 nothing to the Clippers just 2 minutes gone by but the game relatively short drive for them I wasn't going to give to one of our security guys to give it to some fans that is Rick there with the beard and Dez they are here they uh are personal fans fans of head coach Taylor Jenkins which is why they were sitting Courtside with the credentials to watch warm-ups and uh I thought they'd be a really good pick for their FedEx fan of the game Taylor Jenkins an early timeout kind of get everybody settled back down here Grizzlies start 0 for three with a turnover and Harden back at the free throw line also you see on on the on the offensive end how much you try to stay away from Chris Dunn guarding the basketball because the one thing we already talked about top 10 in steals he's excellent with his hands Clippers have own the recent history of the series they have won the last four Kennard's foul line jumper is short need he tries to tap out the rebound and it's a loose ball foul on the Clippers that'll be Ivica Zubac in his first foul he has been having a fantastic year borderline Allstar and he and Edey will battle had 14 rebounds I think it was in the previous meeting between these two teams the Zubac had 19 to go along with 20 points and four Steels and then will'll tie up Jaren Jackson Jr Zubac making a huge impact in the first meeting and off to a start tonight see the the double team is going to come James Harden we saw him play on the top side that means if he gets high Jaren and his teammates have to understand that that double team is coming coming from the Baseline side Zach Edey had to do a good job of planting himself right in front of the rim and the defensive restricted there but they have to talk and let them know where that trap is coming from and the jump ball won by the Clippers and a run ahead by Dunn but Edey is back to dissuade him from a rim attack this is what James Harden would love to do the ability just to played one-on-one basketball dun steps out his three is through dun averaging just six points a game has made an impact already he's got five early there it is Edey deep catch and there'll be a foul called this will be on Norman pal I think Zach Edey did the exact right thing zubac left early to go to go tra he just put himself right at the front of the rim nice find by jar round shooting foul so the shot clock recycles to 14 Jaren screen by Edey runs into Zubac lost it picked up by Kawhi Leonard look ahead for Zubac off his fingertips and out of bounds right now for the gries in had to find a little bit of a rhythm to this basketball game it has just been defensive pressure for the Los Angeles Clippers the gries not able to find a flow on the offensive end to give you a sense Clippers second in the league in defensive efficiency at 108 points for 100 possessions that second it's a distant second because Oklahoma City about 104 points per 100 possessions given up and Jeff Van Gundy is a big reason why he's always been a really good defensive coach tonl I think Brevin has been one of the maybe undervalued is that the right word head coaches in the NBA you know why because he he you never see him punching his chest saying look at what I did it's just all about what the team is doing as Jaren gets the offensive rebound and the whistle blows against Zubac that might be his second that'd be second foul on Zubac it is so that is a big call early as Zubac will more than likely have to take a rest and eubank's not available because of the sprained ankle so they're down at least that big back to Toronto L what he is able to do is is a former point guard played in his league for a long time he is very good at putting players in position to be successful but also the adjustments that he is able to make within games has allowed these teams whether they we talking about injuries this been injury Riddle team this Clippers they have been Kawhi Leonard in and out of the lineup they still find a way to have success with their group Jaren makes two free throws Jaren last night against Phoenix with 17 points and Zubac remains on the floor a 9-2 Clipper lead Kawhi Leonard back iron 0 with a rebound Leonard trying to work his way back after missing nearly three dozen games off the top of the season so many good on ball Defenders you see there Kawhi Leonard coming up with the steal Desmond Bane commits the foul on the other end so Bane picks up his first foul and lend her to the free throw line This is a Clippers team averaging N9 and a half steals per game that's third most in the n ba they force 15 turnovers a game that's the sixth most the thing is you'll see how long before Scottie Pippen Jr becomes a part of this game because the one thing that the Clippers do a great there great on ball Defenders two of their guys are two of the best in the game and right now both of them have been able to come up with steals off the dribble for the Grizzlies Kawhi Leonard in his limited action this year averaging 16 points a game 78% from the free throw line so johnar there and then Scotty pman Jr but they're they're going to have to withstand on ball pressure with this Los Angeles Clippers team they do a good job team defense but they have guys individually they play good defense Norman pow is another one of those guys who will get after defensively Bane Corner three got it first field goal for the Grizzlies on their seventh attempt from the floor jys did shoot particularly well last night in Phoenix but they were dominant on the glass Jaren with the knock away it stays with the Clippers 12 on the timer see this Grizzlies team nice job Luke Kennard pushing Desmond Bane able to find a space to be able to knock down that corner three and I would think brevan that pace has to be crucial for the Grizzlies so that you don't allow the Clippers to set up their defense because they are so good when they can really dig in defensively it's awfully hard to score on the other big thing is you get some stops that then allows you to get out and run to get some better looks as Luke Kennard knocks down a three back to back threes for this Grizzlies team and you hit it on the head as long as they are moving the basketball in bodies then that doesn't allow the Clippers to settle in Kawhi Leonard will try it for three that comes up short in the rebound R in by Edey Konchar on the deck against Zubac lays it in was trying to bait Zubac into a third foul but nothing doing in the Grizzlies rally with it one after trailing by nine there it is good stops rebounds you're able to get out and run you get a mismatch with zuo box against L Kennard who's able to get to Kawhi Leonard a double clutch jumper Grim didn't want it here's an opportunity for their first lead of the game Jaren behind the Edey screen goes at Zubac wrap around for Edey bobbled it Kennard covered up in the corner Wells a to outside three it's through and The Grizzlies have the lead from nine down and a timeout taken by the Clippers Grizzlies with three of their four makes from the floor coming from Beyond The Arc and they've rallied from nine down to take a 13-1 lead nine straight by the visitors Canard going strong to the rack had a great the Indiana Pacers Thursday February the 20th first game after the break right here on FanDuel Sports Network is uh tip time :30 for Grizzlies live presented by Ford midon Ford dealers check your local listings at grizzly.com for the channel guide now we all know that Jaren Jackson Jr is going to the All-Star Game he's having a career year our Royal Caribbean Starwatch 23 a game six boards two and uh 210 assists 1.6 blocks and brevan he's doing it in shorter minutes he's been more efficient shooting a higher percentage than he did last year he also been consistent in terms of games played for him and that that when you see those type numbers and you see the amount of games that Jaren's playing that is a big reason why he is going back to the allstar game because of the way that he affects the game on both ends but you know on a nightly basis he's going to be out there for you pardon the F line jumper that comes up short Clippers are over for their last five Jaren missed the first two regular season games with a hamstring issue that sidelined him as he dumps it down to Edey and it's punched around Jaren comes up with it and Banks it back in against Zubac missed all of preseason season missed all of training camp with a hamstring issue missed the first two regular season games has played every game since and that consistency is the reason why the Grizzlies continue to rely on him on a nightly basis Kawhi Leonard Rises up from three and puts it in kaai Leonard PS the Clippers within one as we go under six minutes remaining here in the first quarter C to him being in the midrange there's been threes tonight good mov B with a backhanded layup pretty play Desmond Bane great job on the Move gets to the basket and the finish the grizz's life here in this first quarter a slow start but they have found their footing here Leonard trying to back down Bane shuts him off T to shoot Kawhi around the Zubac screen drains another one that's what you you expect for him to do a lot of his damage on the offensive end in that mid-range game Clippers team they can hurtt you in a lot of different ways also a big paint team Jaren little off balance hook wed by dun Jen had that three-game run of 30o games and Zubac scores over Jackson but he's failed to get the 20 in both of the last two games Zubac on the board for the first time tonight Clippers back in front it's nice seal by Zubac as he ran down the floor kept Jaren on his back receiv the pass right around the rim was able to get the little half hook down Kennard stops at the elbow Fades misses long rebound right back to Loop he reloads and gets the bounce like everybody fell oh good Steel by Wells pass was overthrown Jaylen hangs hits off glass Harden couldn't locate the outlet pass and The Grizzlies take advantage of the second turnover by the Clippers tonight the activity for this Grizzlies team has picked up since the first timeout called by Taylor Jenkins Zubac backing down it's off his leg and out of bounds he wanted to foul on Edey and Kevin Cutler said nope nothing doing got Aaron pass there that allows jayen Wells to come up with the steal and he does the right thing goes right to the basket after the steal meanwhile Santi Aldama in for the first time tonight Santi with 14 points last night he's been playing well as of late Scotty Pippen Jr Jackson also on the floor for the first time tonight first substitutions for either side and we also get Amir coffee and Bugan bogdanovic into the game for the first time for the Clippers bogdanovic coming over in a deal Edey and bogdanovic oh they fall an offensive foul on Scotti Pippen jrou look like bdon bogdanovic like he initiated the contact does look the left arm the slat I mean that's that's an awful call wow I mean that's just an awful call I mean he fouled him twice he hit him with the left hand across the body with the right hand and then you call an offensive foul just this just this is a bad call yeah that's as bad as they come it's too early to even think about a challenge Brandon Clarke into the game BC I thought was Sensational last night in Phoenix 14 points were able to locate him with Rim runs and finishes bogdanovic that's what he does makes threes was traded by Atlanta here in exchange for bones Highland and Terrence Man Bones Highland wasn't getting much time Terence man though is a big piece here in Clipper land and Bane an off balance cork shrew jumper puts it in a lot of contact DES Bane able to concentrate and knock it down bonov is happy to be with a team with some winning aspirations as coffee misses that Corner three now Coffey has been shooting the three ball very well he's ninth in the lead and Jackson loses it to harden coffee with Bane back finishes and The Grizzlies have given up 10 points off of 12 points now off of five turnovers not the numbers you want to see if you're done this Bane deep yes the number that you're happy with is the Grizzly's three-point shooting here early in this game four of six to start busy shooting the best three-point percentage in franchise history and foul called on James Harden you see Desmond Bane no hesitation coffee doesn't get out far enough no when Dez is feeling good you always saw him knocked down the jump shot in the lane saw him knocked down the corner three and now to walk in top of the key three the ball movement has been fantastic for the gges also seven assists here to start this game Bane again I think he likes into it though Bane with a 13-point first quarter five of five and three of three from the long line and the Grizzlies go up six we're going to have someone have to hold the torch with Ja Morant being down Desmond Bane has it lit right now drick Jones Jr in for the first time tonight high flyer Batum pretty much all he does at this point in his career is shoot threes literally 80% of his attempts come from Beyond the AR bogdanovic off the bounce patum another three that's short it's easier on the knees partner when you have to do all that run and jumping just standing and shooting gives you maybe one more season exactly and how many guys oh Bane will try again he'll make again Desmond Bane a 16-point first quarter from Desmond Bane and Fuego is Desmond Bane and a foul called on Scotti Pippen Jr how about this you know what you have to do partner when someone's hot you keep fighting a hot hand and for whatever reason the LA Clippers not getting a hand up on Desmond Bane and he just continues to torch now Pippen's got to be careful that's two fouls and you're short of point guards tonight harden a step back three put it in three meanwhile for Bane the 16 points here in the first quarter fourth time he's gone for double figures in the first quarter it is his high for any quarter this season and missed at The Rim Coffey leaking out and Brandon Clarke commits the foul meanwhile at the other end of the floor Scott cordi talking to Bane and bogdanovic cuz they got tangled up Bane was unhappy about the lack of a foul call and he grabbed BG there was no foul called but Scott toosi said let's not have any issues let's go downstairs Robin Hood sideline report from Rob Fischer Well everybody's got different things going on during the allstar break Desmond Bane's got something special going on down at TCU where they will be retiring his number one jersey for the horn frogs he said it's going to be special and he's looking forward to it over the break he'll be able to celebrate with friends and family he said it's forever a stamp and tcu's always been great to me and I appreciate the love they give back Ken Richard his teammate got his jersey retired last last year they told Des that he was up next and he said it was being cool it was cool there being there for his retirement he was just my big brother and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't be here but congratulations to Desmond Bane it's going to be a really cool event on the 18th on of TCU yeah that'll be fantastic well deserved continues to make those horn frog fans happy nice pippet creating off the bounds that think for desmond Bane partner he played the entire first quarter yes Bane is a warrior and I don't know that there's anybody who's in better physical shape than Desmond Bane final 39 seconds of the first quarter Harden drives missed the finger roll a look ahead to Pippen I'm here coffee is back Pippen drop off BC yes we talked about it in the pregame show when the guards are running you know that 15 will be running right along with you Scotty Pitman Jr takes the defender to the basket and BC there for the drop off six the difference between the two block Grizzly don't have a foul to give bogdanovic drik Jones Jr came up short and he's grabbing his face I don't know if there was contact there or not Aldama an open three Bango STI Aldama and The Grizzlies have put up 39 in the period against one of the best defenses in the NBA how about this they started off slow on the offensive end good block by Santi air ball Aldama that's going to be late oh and he put it in will not count but Aldama and The Grizzlies wow seven of nine from three-point territory for the Grizzlies on the season the Grizzlies shooting a franchise best 37% from Beyond The Arc Grizzlies were down nine early they have gone up by 11 a 20-point turnaround in one quarter and a 16 to5 run Memphis grizzley's basketball on FanDuel Sports network is presented by fat X where now meets next and by Pinnacle Financial Partners Grizzly's banking from Pinnacle play hard Bank easy Grizzlies with a 39o first quarter and they lead it by 11 the Grizzlies lead the league in first quarter scoring but they have outdone their average grizz's averaging 312 points in first quarters to lead the NBA they put up 3 9 65% shooting I thought the defensive intensity that led to the good offense and of course you got a hot hand in Desmond Bane Kawhi Leonard's double clutch and Kawhi Leonard with nine Leonard coffee bogdanovic Jones and Batum on the floor for the flippers it's Jaren Jackson Jr Pippen AldamaJackson and John Konchar getting minutes tonight wow that was not an easy shot we go back to the Suns game same way Santi started out in that game he came into the basketball game knocking down threes immediately made four of six on the night did Santi Aldama last night he's one of the better bench scores in the NBA Leonard against Pippen who's got two fouls Leonard drives hits and is fouled be the second foul on Jaren Jackson Jr going down and now you seeing Kawhi Leonard in his office I was very happy watching him settle for the threes in the first quarter cuz you don't want him to get into the mid-range where he is so deadly Kawhi Leonard with 12 to lead the Clippers Harden is on the bench at the moment Jaren drives on baton PS and gets a whistle foul will be on Batum and Jaren will get a trip to the free throw line to he the physical advantage over Batum once he's going towards the basket out on the floor batum's still one of those Defenders you have have to be aware of because of the long arms and the reaching at the basketball but once they get into the painted area that's Jaren should have the advantage can't convert on the first free throw Jaren last night five of eight from the free throw line was talking with Taylor Jenkins before the game last night and he compared Jaren very very favorably to Yannis on Koo in terms of the intensity of their preparation that's High Praise You Can't you you can't get much higher than that and of course Taylor Jenkins came to the Grizzlies from Milwaukee where he was in assistant working with Janis Kuma but he also saw both their bodies changing the same way both of those guys came in with a more slender frame as you look at them now both with huge shoulders Hawai missing the jump shot rebound Jackson Jaren against kawad flips that hook it was an airball it came to Aldama Santi way deep and the rebound to Paton said way deep and air Coffey draws the foul that'll put him at the free throw line Coffey is having himself a really good year averaging 10 a game it's a career high number for him in his six season out of Minnesota well all of these teams that when you go through injuries that means that somebody else has an opportunity to step in and play those roles and coffey's done a good job the three-point shooting you know always a guy that will that likes to get out into the lane and run to create some scoring opportunities in the break but the reason why some of these teams that have had the losses to injuries but are still having positive records is because you look at the depth of their basketball team is no different than what this Grizzlies team has been able to do even if you look at a team like Oklahoma City Thunder what they've been able to do with their roster and playing as well as they have with injury that's the mark of a really good team if you can develop players who can step into the breach when called upon and when needed Zach Edey back into the game Jackson his three is off it's boarded by coffee I think the other thing the words you used there what we're seeing more dere Dre what we call helicopter for a reason as he takes off for that two hand slam but you the words you use we're seeing a lot more teams yes there are individuals who are good but the reason why lot good is because you go up and down Scotty pin Jr nice move there but you go up and down a roster and those teams are what is making them successful yeah team's success or lack thereof can often be traced to how well do you develop the talent you have Kawhi Leonard another Miss rebound to Pippen and one of the thingsJackson down the lane Scoops doesn't score rebound Tapped Out Kawhi Leonard will win the race but miss and finish by coffee Coffey makes it a 4539 game coffee with eight Off the Bench but the Grizzlies have been so active Pippen yes and the foul the Grizzlies have been so active in Player Development they have done everything in their power to make sure that they develop the guys that they have and I think Scotty tipping is an example of that oh yeah he's a a great example had an opportunity last season to show what he can do and he comes back this season got better over the summer we said that he was going to be an integral part of what happens in this game here tonight and off of the bench for him early three for three from the floor six points to go along with two assists pipping conver and the lead back to nine Zubac returning number two early fouls for Zubac POW floats misses Jaren snags the rebound Norman pal back on the floor 0 for two to start Jaren backs down against Zubac Zubac knocks him down that's three crowd doesn't like it but Kevin Cutler was forced into putting air in the whistle I mean there was it was a pretty Prett easy knock down I think as you'll see it how at the LA Clippers because it is a third foul with they Challenge and I think Tyron L will challenge I mean it's one of those instances where you you can't that's your one true big that you have left have to see if they could protect them we'll find out who's in cus and what they're dining on when we come back they're going to say that Zubac was in legal guarding position so it becomes the Grizzlies will retain possession but there's no f PBR rides into FedEx for on Saturday and brings edge of your seat action to Memphis experience a thrill and excitement of professional bull riding for one night only tickets now at FedEx forum.com prev you want to know who is assisting Kevin Cutler in scus tonight it was our little Pat seeu tonight Brent barck David Guthrie JB doosa John Conley and shereé Mitchell all in the replay center tonight full house tonight lots of uh lots of action so all 30 teams are playing tonight so no third foul on Zubac it's a successful challenge but the Grizzlies still have the basketball and nearly a steal by Dunn who checks back in let's reset the lineups because there were changes during that timeout for the Clippers pow Leonard Zubac Dunn and Jones D going to go after the game probably because he had or if he can dry off soon enough because he may I think he we have spillage on the front row when he ran into ran into the front row yeah the Grizzlies meanwhile with Wells Jackson Edie Kennard and John konar running around smelling like beer tonight yeah perhaps a Oki chardonay and Edey mishandles seventh turnover pal for three p off to a rough start 0 for three's by nine a look ahead to Jaren in the corner picked up by Jones Jaren nice for Edey well done Jaren Jackson Jr second assist on the night a little big to Big it's going to be there all night yeah it's going to be there the entire night because zubac is is going to continue to be a late help and so he said it earlier only thing Zach Edey has to do is you got to run to the front of the rim every time Kawhi Leonard guarded by Konchar spins away dotted line Jones a foul line jumper D Jones J think about Derek Jones they call him airplane mode or helicopter cuz he is a high flyer but hits the elbow jumper there to make it a nine-point game Jaren on the back down double skip pass intercepted by Kawhi Leonard that's the one pass you can't make that's the pass that they are trying to invite through to make to take away leard with some Nifty handles works his way and hit Kawhi Leonard with 14 he's the only Clipper in double figures Wells Works to the Baseline jasmond Bane a 16-point first quarter Jaren had it knocked away and Jaren a transition take foul and his third foul not a good exchange for the Grizzlies they've turned it over for a ninth time after this big to Big yeah and then you saw the frustration from Jaren Jackson Jr picking up for commits the turnover commence his third foul and then the take foul in committing that foul and you can see the the frustration afterwards Jaren just one of four from the floor and so a free throw and then possession for the Clippers Santi odama is at the scores table presuming Jaren will have to sit so f problems for two of the Premier bigs three on Jackson two on Zubac and Powell converts the transition take foul one shot opportunity James Harden returning to the lineup seven points for him and four feeds in the first quarter the thing that that has made this grizzley team good all year right their second and assist at 29 assists a game was because they've been able to play together and that's what they're going to have to do with this lineup on the floor here play together move the basketball from side to side they got to come up with stops defensively yep and pow his first field goal of the game in the Grizzlies lead has gone from 12 to four and Jaren Jackson Jr on the bench with three fouls and Norman pal career Year from him capping off a 70 run 50 to 46 grizzli lead in single digits Midway through the second as we tell you we got some great home court action coming up after the All-Star

will be crucial tonight herez the six second chance points Desmond Bane at the scores table for his first second quarter action pal leer and the rebound Aldama Griz he took it away from Zubac Kennard feeds Edey off last no and Zubac cleans up the rebound I like the roll I like the catch the shot attempt on this end Ed's doing a good job of just maning the middle as James Harden again is able to use the contact against the defender to get the whistle call and harden a three-point opportunity thing is this when you're defending James Harden it's almost as if you got to keep your hands up the entire time and you almost have to ride them with your body the moment you get your hand down like you normally would do against an offensive player he knows how to embellish the contact but he also does a good job of taking his arm up through your arm so that he gets the call Harden gets 29% of his points from the free throw line that's most in the NBA averaging seven free throw attempts atts per game and Hipp it with a throw away two on one pal lays it in P turn around jumper no points off turnovers 19 points off of 10 turnovers we still got five minutes to go here in the second quarter Harden for the lead Bane loose ball fouled done well the Grizzlies gave up 31 in the first meeting proba said nothing extraordinary un unfortunately we're trending in an extraordinary direction we're going the wrong way here in this game done his first foul third flipper foul of the period gries have already committed their allotment they've committed four Pippen done that'll be a second foul on dun Pippen going to the free throw line there all things being considered the Grizzlies have limited Zubac to two points pow to Five Points Man 10 turnovers and 19 points loss that is a large number for this juncture of the game the Grizzlies on average give up 21 points off their turnovers and that's second worst in the NBA and they're at 19 already he been there kiles here all year but we've had they've done a better job as of late in terms of keeping the number low but also keeping the points off of those turnovers low and we got a stoppage here did the Grizzlies call timeout I think the floor is all wet okay y Derrick Richardson let's get a mop out here officials so the officials call timeout and the attendants come down and oh oh we got more spillage by the Grizzlies bench this time yeah Taylor Jenkins when he was when he was starting to walk up the sideline alerted Derek Richardson to let him know that that it was wet over there here are the Western Conference standings Denver starting to move up the table Grizzlies second Houston has hit a bit of a skid and the Lakers they're the only team that have a better record from January 15th on in the Grizzlies now the Lakers didn't lose to Utah tonight Denver and Houston already have pocketed wins tonight and Jason sedus Ted lasso himself is in the building tonight a good show oh the best sitting with Steve Balmer almost didn't recognize cus with the beard because normally that would be coach beard they both had beards it'd be really weird yeah I I I definitely wouldn't have noticed that that was him no not enjoyed the show yeah for this Grizzy te knew the cers going to make a run they've done a good job the one thing we talked about the turnovers on this defensive end though just keep forcing the Clippers to have to work for their shots Kawhi a fade away back iron grizz's ball watching don't clear the glass back T rebound dun's first there another opportunity Dunn passes on it gives it up to by pipping closes out on him six to shoot screen by Zubac and now a done three Second Chance opportunity and the Clippers have the lead from 12 down first down this second three here it is first half eight for gun on the night Bane drives Pippen a rhythm three and rebound by Zubac long lead pass for Leonard and Kawhi Leonard can't rake it in and The Grizzlies will get it back off the fifth Clipper turnover of the game and we talk about the Grizzlies and they have been turnover prone this Clipper team they turn it over about 16 times a game and give up 18 points off turnovers not good numbers on their side of The Ledger for both of these teams we talked about this has been their Achilles heel the entire season it was just about which team was going to be able to force him and which team was going to do a good job of protecting the basketball Plus 12 right now for the Clippers in points off turnover Luke Kennard back into the game along with Brandon Clarke Jackson Jr on the bench with three fouls griz's without vinch Williams Jr and Ja Morant tonight Kennard curls around the Clarke screen Wells travel basketball but you nailed it with a pinnacle effective advice of the game you can't have any exceptional and right now the turnovers for the grizz's exceptional and not in a good way we know we already knew about the 31 in the first game but also the rebounding was huge with zubac so you just want this is a middle of the road rebounding team but they are great and forcing turnovers going their way here early Harden against Jaylen Wells forced into a fade away one1 defense there by Wells excellent Kennard coffee closes out on him BC pop-up jumper not there rebound to pow and that pass off the fingertips drik Jones Jr a little bit you see how the Clippers commit their turnovers it's not so much on the ball it is some of their passes have just been offt Target and because of it has led to these turnovers back toback turnovers he had the done long pass to Kawhi Leonard that was off of his hands and this pass here from Norman pow too far for Dereck Jones to be able to corra Zubac out of the game Batum returns for the Clippers quick have the smaller lineup his Brandon Clarke to five for the Grizzlies Bane po to a cutting Garrett Jones misses offensive rebound Clippers got out to an early nine-point lead Grizzlies flipped it around led by 12 and now a three-point advantage to the Clippers Kennard drives got to the cup and laid it in Lefty lay in by Luke Kennard nice offensive game for Luke the last couple games somewhat of a struggle for him on the offensive end terms of making making shot but just getting shot attempts for him so nice to see it here early Hardon missed at The Rim Bane downhill derck Jones Jr committing the foul that'll put Bane at the free throw line lar good job of getting a step there on coffee no help coming zubac out of the game just zero shot blocking on the floor for the Clippers takes advantage of it with the laying Bane shoots two downstairs to fish yeah and interesting guys when you talk about Luke Kennard and what gets him going maybe having the ball in his hands does he said for me coach knows if I have the ball in my hands especially ear early in the game it gets me going a little bit gets me into a rhythm credit to Coach Jenkins for just trusting me in that aspect but also getting me going early and getting me involved in the game when I'm in situations like that I'm just continuing to try to make the right play and be aggressive I like that he always uses that word at the end guys aggressive because when aggressive that's when we see the best Loop coffee C good bench production from the Clippers near middle of the road bench unit in terms of Point production Grizzlies lead the league at 46 bench points per game Aldama a big part of that back door cut Fain back hands it up no tipped in by Clarke St good back door cut by Desmond Bane good job by BC to be here on the putback Jones for three Derek Jones Jr well he's averaging 13 a game in the last three he's got nine here on four of six shooting and and he throw it away basketball have turned it over a dozen times nine of them have been Clipper Steels that was just quean throw away Harden and one James Harden so we vintage step back for James Haren but the other thing is you see on the first step the first step that he takes he puts the ball up in the air as if he's going to shoot that makes that gets Brandon Clarke to jump now he still has the second step to make clear himself the reach by Desmond Bane and one opportunity for Harden Harden with a dozen after so many years partner still one of the hardest guards one-on-one in the game well the other thing that he did too this summer is he got as many of the Clippers as could make it over to Tempe Arizona in Arizona State of course where Harden played his college ball Conor drains a three and you know the the the narrative on James Harden had always been a little mixed you know sometimes well is he really in shape is he is he really does he want to be here well he wants to be here with the Clippers and he gathered like I said as many of the Clippers just could make it and they really had as poell throws down with the right hand really had a good session in Tempe playing ball playing softball getting to know one another and Harden said look I I need to be a leader because Kawhi Leonard's not going to be available at the beginning of the Season that word and Paul George is in around the thing I was going to say is the word that's used his leadership has grown over the years and I don't know if all of his teams would have said he was a leader when he was in OKC's Desmond Bane Jackson oh wow Jackson with the acrobatic follow and that'll do it for the first half the Grizzlies at a 12-point lead but the Clippers a big second quarter they outscore the Grizzlies 38- 24 after the Grizzlies put up a 39-point first quarter high scoring hope you got the over 6663 Clippers with the advantage Clippers trying to get their 19th win in their new state-of-the-art Arena 6663 Clippers on FanDuel Sports Network called the wall here if you come here you you have they have to give you a disclaimer if you come here light if you have light sensitivity ISS and you can't come play you can't come to this Arena and if you have difficulty climbing stairs you definitely should not come to this Arena if you're if you're if you're a TV announcer or you're doing the radio of some sort you better wear sneakers Kawhi Leonard all right off the top Clippers 22 and five with a halftime lead grizz's 9 and 13 when they Trail it intermission an important number Jaren Jackson Jr three fouls so this he going to get the ball to Jaren closer to the basket so they just have to work so hard from the perimeter against perimeter Defenders well off the high glass and the foul nice pump fake there by jayen Wells and then the step through to get the And1 opportunity you see here the ball fake step through you see the hand there the concentration finish so Wells to the free throw line seven on the night he admitted to Taylor Jenkins that he wasn't wasn't calling it The the rookie wall there's the wall and we've been told that opponents shoot about 75 % from the free throw line when they're shooting in that direction which is a pretty low number for an NBA team but Jaylen Wells would he wasn't calling it The Rookie wall but he realized that he was wearing down a little bit usually guarding the other team's best score Kawhii Leonard backhanded layup he boarded by Jaren Jackson Jr the MB is a totally different game than College a ruing season Jaren again Zubac HS it in they're they're going to need a a more engaged Jaren Jackson J here in the second half we talked about the frustrations of the first half picks up three fouls but there nice aggressive move to get closer to the basket I thought in that first in the first half we settling for the longer floaters with the two long steps a lot more physical move there to get closer Hardon two-man game Zubac off balance hook Zubac two for two from the floor he has not hurt the Grizzlies in the same manner that he did back on December the 23rd the offensive rebounds haven't been there blop for Edey couldn't catch it well defended by Zubac pal pull up three Norman pal first three-point make of the night for him pal shooting 43% from Beyond The Arc Jackson against Kawhi Jaren last no rebound tipped around foul on Zach Edey loose ball foul Edey his first of the game but back to Norman pal for a second he's riding an 11 game streak of 20 or more points that is a career long he also had a 10 game streak earlier this year and Brevin he has adapted beautifully from a full-time bench guy to a full-time starter here with the Clippers well he he asked for more and a lot of times when guys ask as for more it may be too much jar sh foul on Jaylen Wells here out on the floor but for Norman po the mo was exactly what he wanted and he has fit extremely well next to James Harden because he is a spot up shooter but a guy that couldn't put the ball on the floor so it creates a space for James Harden and for Kawhi Leonard to be able to do their thing Wells his first foul Harden big Collision there a lot of contact both ways but Harden knocks in his second three of the game Harden with 16 Bane curls Baseline stolen done Kawhi Leonard and The Grizzlies call time again the turnovers but his Grizzlies team is derailing their entire offense here in this game it has been an issue all season long 10 straight by the Clippers they have their largest lead of the game a 10 run after the Grizzlies tied the game at 68 let's get to cleaning the Glass Service Master by Stratus Jackson acrobatic follow Bane had been redot for three butsays you know what every once in a while you might miss so that's Jackson going to clean the glass and throw it back in off the Miss by Desmond Bane forJackson four first half rebounds that on the offensive end cleaning the glass brevan is is there a simple straightforward answer to the turnover issues cuz some some of these it is going into crowds some of it is just throwing the ball in the wrong direction what I thing is at this juncture they're throwing the ball to a spot instead of throwing the ball to a player and so when you throw it to a spot then you are anticipating that your teammate is going to be on that spot but right now they're not there and so because of it the turnovers are happened I think that the grids have to do a better job of making sure you see the person that you are throwing the basketball to identify them and then make the pass don't assume in other words Jaren in the lane Wells shot clock down to seven Jaylen picked up by Kawhi puts it on the deck step back jumper ring in as we go downstairs to Rob fer well Taylor Jenkins telling the team during that time out he said we've got to start creating more space we've got to take that space as well take space create space can't keep playing one-onone like we have here so far tonight he said the ball's got to move better we've got to move better without the ball Grizzlies have just 14 assists on 27 field go and then dun pays that possession off with a three in the Clippers their largest lead of the night yeah 14 assists on 27 baskets Grizzly's assist on about 65% they're below that well below that tonight Jaren leer short to that shot partner did tonight has all been right below the free throw line the only shot that we saw him knocked down in the second half he got himself almost to the top of the defensive restricted area that's what Taylor Jen is talking about take up that space Zubac with the dun you got to create more space get to where you want to right now the Grizzlies allowing the Clippers on the defensive to dictate what shots they want them to take Wells a catch and shoot three off the back iron rebound Zubac four gone by here in the third quarter pal off the curl Clippers in a rhythm 55% from the floor conversely they're getting whatever shot they want to get on the offensive end they're eight of nine from the floor in the period Wells lost it got it back short shot clock down to six lot of standing for the Griz and tonight partner jaron's area on the floor is not out beyond the three-point line trying to handle the ball these are smaller Defenders on the floor so it's making it that much harder for him to get to the to the basket he is going to have to catch the ball in the mid post at the elbow but to try to think that you're going to take guys off of the dribble in this game tonight and some sometimes you got to adjust there going to be games in nights where that's that is your strength there going to be other nights that's not your strength tonight it's not his strength trying to play off of the dribble against these smaller guards Kawhi Leonard knocks down a three and this one starting to get away that's now 30 points off Grizzly turnovers Kawhi Leonard buries the three and the Clippers starting to create some big time Separation on the scoreboard 18-point lead there don't lie Clippers are leaded by 18 hey you know what one91 collabs re is coming back uhoh it's presented by Hennessy continues celebrating Memphis designers and showcasing our City's unique voice and Vibe through hyper

in our one N1 collapse so you know what that means I will be back you again it's all about the drip well now for the Grizzlies it's all about stopping the bleeding Scotti Pippen Jr into the game along with Shanti Aldama Jaylen in a crowd and the result is a turnover Harden no look and open done three wow and the Clippers simply cannot miss here in the third this has gone a 33-point turnaround Wells stays with the Grizzlies Hardon dealing his eighth assist of the game I think the big thing for the Grizzlies is again can can they find an offensive rhythm with moving the basketball moving bodies and with that then can you get good shots on the end and then on this end and then after that get back in transition Aldama knocks down the three Santi Aldama nine Off the Bench all of his points coming from the three point line Jay Huff healing the assist he's in for the first time tonight he guard Zubac Zubac backs him down swings the hook and nobody is a better hook shot guy in the NBA than he gets a Zubac we see as soon as help comes in the game they go right to the one-on-one with Zubac STI goes to the basket gets the foul and stays down s's up pal lays it in and a foul this has just been a dominant effort by the LA Clippers out of the locker room a determined basketball team on both ends defensively stifling on the offensive end moving the basketball sharing it guys attacking the basket and when they do attack whether they're getting finishes at The Rim or the kickouts for good Rhythm jump shots well they're 12 of 13 from the floor here in the period and pal knocks that down pal with eight in the quarter 15 for the game Tipp it meanwhile the Grizzlies can't buy a bucket they had the hot first quarter though partner even in the second quarter s the offense slowed down for them in in that second quarter and coming into the third quarter has pretty much been shut off Harden drives got to step against Bane shot clock to five Kawhi's three is off Darren Taps the rebound of the Grizzlies have it Huff were very limited in the paint against the Clippers in the first meeting same situation tonight take away jayen Wells two onone Leonard is back Wells hangs and hits and draws the foul Jaylen Wells continues to put forth the effort here in this third quarter to try to give the gries a boost on both ends of the floor see he comes up with the steal the run out nice job to be able to take the contact concentrate and finish his second time going to the line for a three-point play opportunity Kaw Leonard his first foul Jackson in pipping out Taylor Jenkins continues the search for answers if you are joining us late no Ja Morant no Vince Williams Jr tonight both with sore KNE the whales can't pay off the end one should point out that Yuki kawamura and Zion pullan are both with the Grizzlies and they are active tonight they were not with the Grizzlies yesterday in Phoenix Kawhi step back three airball shot clock violation Kawhi 21 tonight that's the fourth time he's gone for 20 plus his season ey 27 as you look at Marvin baggley he's been dealing with an injury and The Grizzlies are in the process of getting him in their return to competition conditioning program and Taylor Jenkins said before the Grizzlies started his road trip the hope would be he would be active uh after the uh Allstar break and the thing with that he brings his experience as he's been riddled with injuries his entire career but I always love a guy who feels as though he got something to prove and so he will be a guy who have something to prove and so his athleticism and his size can help this Grizzlies team when they need to go to the bench for size and Grizz there with another turnover I think that he's a guy that can help it's short stin for this team potentially could give you a little bit more physicality Zubac blocked by Huff a Timeout on the floor we have a huff snuff at into a dome and a timeout also have a 21 Point Clipper lead they have dominated here Cleveland Cavaliers rather they have been absolutely Sensational no one has more homecourt wins than do the Cleveland Cavaliers and The Grizzlies they've never faed particularly well in your old favorite City yes you know I still love going back to Cleveland I love the fans that that that are there and they're finally being treated to an excellent basketball team you already know what Mo's able to do uh with with uh Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland I mean this is a a team and you look at how this Clippers team plays very similar in that they'll get after you defensively but they also have a number of offensive weapons tell you part I the worst with names it just it is absolutely ridiculous I can tell you a number nam's heart misses that three there Grizzlies just standing and watching Norman po would come up with the rebound Grizzlies have been really good on the second night of backto backs s- one second best of Denver Denver's 10 and one on the season harden off balance gets his own off the glass and puts it back up and in one of those games partner where you you turn say what's coming up tomorrow Allstar break Allstar break yeah All-Star break for the Grizzlies not for the Clippers they have to go to Salt Lake City tonight after this game and they'll play the Jazz tomorrow Dereck Jones Jr and that game was rescheduled because of all the fires here in the Los Angeles area bogdanovic back in pal out Amir coffee also into the game I think this Clippers team bre I I think they're they're trying to find some type of Rhythm cuz there are games where they are as dominant as they are tonight well splashes the three and then they go to Toronto and lose well the thing for them is you look at him this is a very small basketball team and not a very physical basketball team so they why they rely on team defense they rely on individual one-on-one defense and then they're going to be predicated or can Harden continue to turn back the clock to be a guy that scores and assists on the majority of possessions and Jackson gets the and one to go there and can Kawhi Leonard stay healthy enough for long enough to give them another scoring option to go along with Norman pal Jackson coffee with the contact and one Jackson four on the night he'll go to the free throw line Luke Kennard back in j Huff to the bench the gries would would like to have a realistic chance of getting back into this game they're going to have to come up with the defensive stops they've cut down on turnovers but now the offensive rebounds have kicked in for this Clippers team and so things have to tighten up in all areas of the game especially when you get down with this type deficit Jackson missing against the wall Jaren nice knock away it'll stay with the Clippers 12 on the shot clock 224 for the third quarter a third quarter that has been all about the Clippers they have been absolutely on fire here in the third quarter 62% from the floor five of nine from three Isaiah blown this game open tied at halftime Coffee Baseline no Zubac offensive rebound and Zubac is fouled foul onJackson said it was it wasn't the turnovers now has turned into the offensive rebound and we said they couldn't be extraordinary well they're extraordinary again and forcing the turnovers and now they're becoming extraordinary and grabbing the offensive rebounds with possessions with here another basket off of a second opportunity 13 Second Chance points for the Clippers Pippen drives down the lane Jaron with a punch nice drive and J drop off for an easy one for jir Clippers three offensive rebounds here in the third quarter they haven't missed very many shots as I just said problem is that the few shots that they've missed they gone back and got the other thing it's a possession game Clippers 10 more shots banovic Zubac no on the f Jackson Euro steps through Scoops doesn't score rebound Zubac Zubac one of only five players averaging 15 and 10 with a block per game Jaren with the rejection But Then followed up by bogdanovic Pippen lost the handle wanted a foul got his arm grab reason why he lost for Basketball Jones one of a handful of lefties on this Clippers team and note that will make our producer Scott Zachary very happy also a southpaw Wells misses that three and we're inside of 40 seconds remaining in the third quarter and the Clippers have taken a three-point halftime lead and extended into as many as 23 here in corter number three Harden step back three read the difference between the clocks as pipping Works to front court griz's at 36 and 17 second best record the franchise has ever had at the All-Star break Jaren Hooks and hits you see the difference when this Zubac defending now you can play off with the dribble to take him on the inside to get a shot to go to get a good look for Jaren it's just when you with the guards that are harassing up under you it's very hard for you to get from a should be the way Jaren would like to yeah he pretty much needs to get below the dotted line almost to the top of the restricted area Harden with an air ball out of bounds 1.5 remaining Zubac doesn't have the foot quickness to be able to say with Jaren look what he's shooting that shot the dotted line the other shots that he was shooting were above the dotted line in the painted area Desmond Bane dem mummifies all the wraps and he will come back in Bane was 16 in the first quarter only one point since he spended a lot of energy in that first quarter play in the entire first quarter yeah the grizz's had a lead after one quarter 3928 it all got washed away here in the third quarter 102 to 84 Clippers in command with an 18-point lead as we move to the final fin 12 minutes before the All-Star break Jaren Jackson Jr in double figures with 11 couple of blocks as well but it's the Clippers night tonight so far 22 fast break points for the clips 84 the tally as we head to the fourth and final quarter here in Englewood California about nine or so miles from downtown LA cloudy rainy miserable weather day here in Southern California oh Dr got a chance to see the I still call the Great Western form I know it's called the Kia form at this point but bring back old memories for us yeah a fabulous form then it was a great western for then it you wanted the party you would go to The Forum to The Forum Club yes I'm not going to get too far into it not going to get too far into it I actually here's Kennard he drives he misses andJackson fles it through Grizzly starting the fourth with Gigi and Jaren Jackson Kennard Bane and Brandon Clarke now here's the thing partner the game is not over no the Griz you make a a quick run here to start this fourth quarter but they're going to have to expend energy to get themselves back into this game pum a pump fake and splashes the three we talked about saving those knees the fly by happen all he did was side step to still get the three off there was no attacking of the basket there for Jaren on the back down Bane Clarke doubled doubled again and a throwaway picked off by bat coffee Amir Coffey drawing the foul he'll go to the line where he is four for four tonight how far back I go in the NBA I did a game for the Detroit Pistons at the fabulous form and you know who you know who's playing for the the Lakers back then who our good friend Nick Van XEL oh listen quick was a problem yes he was holy cow if for for those that that don't know or have not seen very many highlights you want to talk about creative ball handling Nick man XEL was your guy oh Nick Van XEL was I mean there's there's a there's a couple of guys but I'm just saying Nick Van XEL was exceptional with the ball in his hands and I always say for lefties when you have to guard lefties and what they do it always looks better because we're not accustomed to everybody's right-handed so you see a lefty do it just looks so nice but then he was so skilled with what he did on the floor it it was I hated to have to play against him I love to watch ni the quick Kennard bail out of there no shot opportunity Aldama's back in he tries for three and draws a three- shot foul from bogdanovic so Aldama to the line Clippers trying to win a fifth straight against the the Grizzlies it would be their longest ever win streak over the Grizzlies and teron Lou has a challenge available so he's going to challenge it so what was the cuisine we had in chagus tonight we had a little PCU tonight whatever that is with shrimp shrimp thae food people oh P pad tie okay it's a pad CU you also all skill levels are welcome backpack t-shirt and game tickets included sign up at grizzlies.com Junior Grizzlies successful challenge the contact with bogdanovic and Aldama was negligable and in fact it was really a high five if as a Defender you are trying to block a shot the shots away and you basically high five the offensive player it's not a foul so Clippers will get it and they're two for two on challenges tonight but no more challenges left said the grizzly had an opportunity down to 16 you said can you get a stop couple of stops and can you get some scores Force the Clippers to call a timeout the problem is the Clippers have gone on their little five run to break this back out to a 20-point lead bogdanovic Batum lost it out of bounds nobody lost their partner he was trying to get to the three-point line he was open in the mid in the little short Corner jumper but he wanted to get to the three-point line it's a new NBA just run to the three-point line particularly if you're over 30 Aldama drives hangs comes up empty and Aldama slow to get to his feet and a foul called on Luke canag I said that the Clippers are trying for their franchise best five-game win streak against the Grizzlies they also had a four-game win streak against the Grizzlies between April of 2011 and March of 2012 there'll be one more meeting between these two teams it'll be here Coffey offensive rebound yes and a foul foul on Jaren Jackson Jr March 21st will be the third and final regular season meeting between these two teams said it's been the offensive rebounds and again another offensive rebound H back for the Clippers play I'm going to guess that Taylor Jenkins will say something that he usually says after games like this we didn't have it tonight and that might be the most succinct appraisal of tonight's events Jaren yes and the foul Grizzlies shot 65% in the first quarter and had an 11-point lead they were seven of nine from three the Grizzlies are four of 18 six from three it took a you said a mammoth effort from Desmond Bane with the 16 points in that first quarter also some timely shot making that gave the Grizzlies the chance and an opportunity at this game but it has been all Clippers here in this second half bonovich Drive got to the cover you know they talk about this wall this long stretch of unbroken seating in the end zone to which the Grizzlies are shooting about teams Don't Shoot free throws and we have a wedgie the Grizzlies shooting toward the wall from the free throw line are one of four you have a wedgie there Desmond Bane we got a wedgie we got Tai C Pad Tai CU padc pad CU got a lot of stuff going on yeah see we can get some P cuu ordered up here to the to the to the desk maybe they won't deliver this far away question how much longer you keep Desmond Bane this game good hands here by Jackson gz with number numbers and Gigi with a two-handed flush and a timeout taken by Tyron Luke 112 to 90 griz's got the turnover Jackson with the take away eight for him to go along with seven board player of the game re in the last five he was averaging just five a game but a nice little Breakout game for him heading into Allstar Weekend yeah you always know that he's going to give you the effort on the defensive side but tonight it was nice to see him get involved offensively a couple of And1 opportunities to steal to run out there for for Jaylen stand still jump shots we we've seen what we had saw what we saw earlier in the season with Jaylen Wells on the offensive end being a guy that they can use and play off of others extremely well line for Jaylen tonight couple of steals as well he will be headed to the Bane Area Zach Edey to represent the gri in the rising stars game pal off last and the rebound to Al Donald one statistical nugget to share with you the Grizzlies 37 points wait a second 39 points lost off turnovers it is the most points the Grizzlies have lost off turnovers this season Aldama for three that is the previous high was 36 against the Knicks I mean 39 points is just you think about now that that is you know 70 in two games versus the Clippers right now and he still and it's still running got a Clipper turnover here Batum not accustom to being there he's in that area of the floor not comfortable but to one of the reasons why this is the oldest team by average age in the NBA Jackson trying to dump it off and got fouled on the play 744 remaining here in the fourth Dereck Jones Jr with the foul Zubac at the scorers table and guess what couple of Miss free throws and people here will get free food pretty much in every Arena pretty much where where they they have this special for their fans uhoh hopes of fast food are alive Rob Fisher oh no they're going to drown me out if he misses this thing but I wanted to tell you guys a little bit more about Marvin Bagley you were talking about him earlier he according to Taylor Jenkins he's going through a return to play process right now had a little knee and an ankle injury when he was in Washington so coach said he doesn't expect them to join the team before the All-Star break which he hasn't he said we're going to take the this time to get him acclimated with the team the program the standard the system and then get him back right but I think he's Turing in a good direction he should be back right after the All-Star break so another addition to this team and an intriguing addition to this team after the All-Star break I think he's he's intriguing and Brevin in all fairness to Marvin Bagley he's not been in a winning situation wherever he has been whether it's been Detroit uh or Sacramento the team that drafted him or or in Washington now if you put him in a solid program with a good culture good Player Development Group and you're winning basketball games will that help I mean obviously he came from a great program in Duke that will hold you accountable here's a bane three on the way and Desmond Bane has hit for 20 for the 16th time in the last 19 games but another thing there's zero pressure on Marvin baggley here with this Grizzard team with those other teams teams that were struggling trying to find their way well they're saying well this going to be the high draft pick that they're able to come up with with this foul there on Luke Kennard with Zubac is this going to be the high draft piic that we're getting it's going to turn the corner well for this Grizz team is I said you're going to need him in short sticks can he give this team 10 to 15 minutes on a regular basis or from game to game and I think when somebody has a little bit of something to prove and then you have to you have to do it in a scenario where nobody's expecting anything there are zero expectations for him with this basketball team but he can definitely help yes with his size and athleticism and his experience for this Grizzlies team and I would imagine from his point of view hey I'm going to a winning situation good chemistry good team good franchise hey this is an opportunity for me I need to grab this I think as long as he stays healthy he'll do all that he can to be impactful herard little off balance Fade Away jumper off the back iron and the rebound to Zubac Harden two rebounds away from a triple double he's got his double double already then throws it away for Harden it's double double number 24 Ben Simmons also in a return two playay program and he feels that that he can help this Clippers team and with that in mind Mr Knight I respect your opinion as Zubac blocks that Bane try what can Ben Simmons offer to this team he gives him another ball handler on the floor po gets to the basket with the foul he gives him another ball handler he gives him a a guy who who can also be a multi-positional Defender for you whether and that's what we've seen here with the Clippers tonight the ability to switch across the board except for zubac he's the one guy that stays with the big but the other four guys have switched across the board so you bring a engaged Ben Simmons not not just his name but he's got to be engaged Ben Simmons then there's NE no one has ever doubted what his talent is you just always question what your engagement is going to be are you going to give it 100% yeah are you invested in what we're trying to do that has been the question and so he comes to a team where you're going to be held accountable guys are going to call you out if you're not doing it and so he he can be a huge asset for this team I still believe that if Eubanks can give them something with his size behind Zubac and with Benin Simmons then that puts this this Clippers team in that dangerous category yeah bug donovich gives you another three-point stick gron Clarke offensive foul he gives you the spacer the floor spacer that you need because you I talked about Kawhi Leonard he likes to get his work done mid-range for the most part we saw him take the threes early James Harden is like going to play off the dribble screen and roll action whether it's step backs or it's to create opportunity so you need guys like Norman Powell and bogdanovic on the floor to allow those two guys to be their best speaking of being on the floor I'm a little surprised tyou has left guys out as long as he has Zubac collects his rebound that's his 11 so a double double for Zubac bogdanovic shot clock violation Zubac 12 and 11 rebounds and for Ivica Zubac it is a career-high 33rd double double for teron L we were worried about his size and it hasn't been that hasn't really affected the game as he did in the first out Aldama with the little hook Santi with 14 Off the Bench tonight again this is a Clippers team they have to play that rescheduled game in Utah speaks to how dangerous still think this Grizz team can be even at this juncture Bane repositions and hits a three 23 for Bane is six triple of the game and teron loes we're not done with this yet it's a 15-point game 117 to 102 that's the reason why those guys are still in the game and why they continue to trickle back into the game Bane is tied his career I beg your pardon a season high with 6 three-point makes tonight up turnovers grevin you had said in the Pinnacle effective advice of the game can't have any any out outliers nothing too exceptional well the exceptional number is 39 points for the clippers off of 21 Memphis turnovers you'll look at the variety of turnovers here that the gries got themselves into some of it getting yourself in the crowd we talked about other times throwing the ball to a spot we're not going to we're not going to negate how good of a def defensive team this Clippers Squad is and so they force you into tough situations they have guys with great hands that are able to force steals whether on the basketball or away from the ball we talked about the ability to switch across the board then allows them to stay in the passing Lanes it's been another rough night on the road with turnovers Kawhi Leonard thought about it he'll drive it and drunk it with the right hand the Grizzlies lost 36 points on turnover s at New York 33 at Oklahoma City tonight is season high it's been a rough night with the rock for the grizli you know you know it's a rough night when BC misses two of his Prime Time shots Brandon Clarke is two of five from the floor knocked away from Zubac picked off by Clarke and a bad outl pass bu donovic with the steel Leonard dries doesn't finish but will get a trip to the free throw line again remember I told you that just throwing the ball to a spot but not to a player it just happened again with Brandon Clarke 17 steals for the Clippers tonight they average around nine Leonard four for four from the line tonight 24 for him and the Clippers 20 of 21 from the free throw line and Nicolas Batum comes back in bonovich goes out vov and one of the keys was to keep harden off the free throw line only four free throws attempted for him but the Clippers that our top six in free throw percentage will build on that number tonight 21 of 22 Norman pal is the guilty party with a lone Miss for the Clippers tonight he's got to buy everybody din at least Bain boarded by Leonard under four remaining Batum boarded by Wells good night good nice active night for Jaylen Wells yeah he's gone through some struggles he had been at one point the leading rookie score in the NBA he's tapered off with the scoring but again the workload that he has guarding the other team's best offensive player and Wells knocks down his third three of the game to give him 18 that eventually he starts to wear to your legs because does it it's it's not just the half court defensive pressure he's picking up his guy 94 ft as soon as the ball either goes in or a shot his Miss he's running directly to his match up pal for three he wants that 20-point game it would be a 12th consecutive 20-point game for him the 11 game streak is already a career high Aldama lobs for Clarke yep it's not a BC KN it's not a Grizzlies night that too timeout taken by the Clippers Zubac grabbing his 13th rebound of the game in a 121 105 contest Desmond Bane a 23o night tonight in January he averaged 21 a game on 54% shooting 44% for three it was his best shooting month and he really hasn't tapered off here in the month of February either no he's just continued you talk about being a warrior for this team and I thing for Dez is he's played multiple roles for this Ry team whether he's playing with the ball in his hands as the playmaker creator for himself or his teammates where he's playing off of the ball and and waiting for those opportunities when he's able to just be a standstill shooter the mid-range shot the going to the basket finishing we we've just seen Dez continue to Blossom this season and with it you seeing the rebounds we seeing the assists the overall the overall of his game has just grown Desmond Bane averaging 18 for the season but 20 on back toback nights 20 last night in Phoenix 23 tonight tying a season I with six made threes also had six in the game uh in or at home against the Chicago Bulls Grizzlies ended up losing that game but Bane had six triples in that game proof positive you can find a really fine NBA player with the 30th overall pick in the draft Grizzlies have actually found a couple with Santi Aldama and Desmond Bane the thing is you you find usually around those picks partner you find guys who are ready to play they have they have a skill set they want to prove that they should have been higher and the only reason I wasn't was because I was a fouryear guy or I went three years and so the Grizzlies have been able to find these Diamonds in the Rough as tyou has cleared his bench he has indeed Mar Marshon Bo champ cam Christie along with Kobe Brown Kai Jones Patty Mills cam Chrisley drops in the three-point B is that Max Christy's brother it is Jackson for three playing some good basketball yeah New Opportunities sometimes a change of address is all you all you need here well the other thing was he was starting he was already playing better with even when he the Lakers they moved him into the starting lineup and when they did that the Lakers went on a really nice run with being another three Dallas beating Golden State tonight M Chris Max chrisy another good game there Jackson with 15 six double figure scoring game for him final 90 seconds on schooling here at into it D G's live post game on the way tonight's game produced by Scott Zachary it was directed by Tom hu Brian Wright with the graphics Joe balos ripping and clipping the replays stage manager to the Stars John Pew Reynolds making sure that we didn't get lost in this Cabernet building so high up and a finish underneath for cam Christie and Taylor Jenkins calls timeout he's not happy with how that transpired now Kawhi Leonard a 25-point game for him tonight and this is uh this is going to be a vital piece to see how the Clippers are going to end up this season I mean right now they're battling to stay out of the playin playin tournament and a healthy Kawhi Leonard will go a long way toward helping them stay out of spots seven and low yeah well the the the thing for for him is it's all about his health and if he can play and finish out this season playing consistently for the te because the other only a lot of times people talk about what that player is able to do but it's also how the other guys are able to play with you and if you're not there on a regular basis that's very hard to incorporate you into what is going on and so if he's able to find consistency within in terms of playing games for this Clippers team he is still one of the better players in the association you see what he's able to do he's usually an efficient player he doesn't take bad shots defensively he can guard one through five and so if if if he can continue to stay and play at this level along James Harden still Kawhi Leonard is a a major piece but I still think it's James Harden's leadership is what's going to also Aid them and being the team I said that can be a very dangerous team yeah I did I think the way that Hardon has embraced the leadership role CU again there there have been times where people like does he really want to be with this particular team right that's not the case here he's fully invested with his flippers team and Zion pulling is in is as is Yuki kaura Zion pulling turnaround jumper nope and the rebound to Brown number the folks here have decided to head out and avoid the traffic Kai Jones with the throw down six Clippers and double figures including all five starters Zubac Harden with double doubles John Konchar with the three-point make jond Bane with 23 to lead the gries and Kawhi Leonard a game high 25 for the Clippers shot clock goes dark Clippers will get their 30th win of the season it'll be their second consecutive win after losing three in a row and they have now won four their last six here at in Dome grizzli fall to 36 and 18 their three-game Road winning streak the longest of the season comes to an end tonight and the Clippers have now on five straight over the Grizzlies that is a franchise best for the Clippers 128 114 is your final back to wrap it up in
