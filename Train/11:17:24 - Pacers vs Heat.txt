 I mean he can't sustain it I don't expect to see the same thing out of him the other person that got going quite frankly is the guy with the ball at a bio played didn't play very well in the first half cut that's a famous cut that actually Miami uses a lot off his leg that's ooh guy take starts driving and if he does this Miami is the first team that I saw do that consistently and now love he misses he made all of his threes the other night in that third quarter he was three for four including three of three in the third and I'm looking for him to attack more Ma I'm looking for him to attack more I thought he was really passive but I thought his defense forced him to worry more about Herro than attacking don't passes yeah well he had to got it hit Turner for three five nothing Indiana if Siakam gets it into pain unless they come doubling don't pass it yeah speaking about Mathurin he had a stret of seven straight games in double figures but he only had eight points the other night that's batted by Adebayo yeah that's because he was worried about where Herro was he had anticipation on the other end of the slot cut he got worried about Herro defensively and I thought it took him first ever then the inseason tournament now the NBA cup they lose their first game this year here's love and he left it short so he's missed his first two shots he was six of eight on Friday here's Turner for another three Myles got it eight nothing but a good read by Sheppard too cuz he drove it hard and Miami had to take a timeout Myles Turner two good start for Indiana here they've been a good first quarter team they led the heat the other night by three they're one of the best in the leagues in the first quarter where the placers get in trouble is the second quarter Tyler Herro had a 20-point game on Friday night Highsmith was good as well all five of their heat starters were in double figures on Friday night got to communicate they Highsmith under pressure and the long rebound though pulled down by Rozier who's at the basket and scores there's a second chance opportunity for Miami Indiana ranked 28th in rebound percentage Miami is just 26th they've been one of a they've been a better rebounding team in the past Quinn than the heat have shown early this year and a three-point play for Terry Rozier Eric spoler in his 17th season a couple of titles good strong pict just set there by Ma I mean Kevin Love got got pop doubling out top mine has it he should have ke and G to work Turner off balance banked it up to strong Herro that's why I said it because the Myles ends up having to take a difficult shot I'd much rather mine do that cuz he's got a better chance to beat his man Herro off the screen finds love thank goodness a bad pass good defense by Indi picked off by Haliburton and tipped by Mathurin good advance of the ball Sheffer for three really good advance of the ball mine got it and Advance Ben Sheard Ben Sheppard shooting 41% from behind the AR making his fourth straight start as Herro gets to the rim too easy well look the ball's already up the court Sheppard attacks again and Sheppard missed it rebounds tipped and it belongs to Miami stay solid in what you're doing starting lineups this year and the last number of games they've had to go without Jimmy Butler here's out ofo to the Baseline and it's blocked Turner got it Indiana's all all time Le just keep it moving Turner in the post over love left it short love is a a Savage Defender pushed um Myles just before he was ready to get into his post up position Siakam now defending Adebayo and that's rebounded by Mathurin Miami shot a season High 52% Friday night in fact the first time the Heat this year had been above 50% but a lot of that had to do with their fast break points that's a foul on Rozier cuz they had like 18 to 19 fast break points so you know that makes a huge difference he did not shoot a free throw on Friday night and this is a guy that's averaging almost six attempts per game playing in his 1050th game with the Pacers now a message from Tyrese Haliburton and fiser imports when it's time to sell or trade your car bring it to one of two Fishers Imports locations you can be in and out in less than 5 minutes Fishers import it's a slam dunk yeah Quin to that point when when he's not getting to the free throw line that really affects his game doesn't well it it it does and and as we said were talking about earli he he didn't have the ability be and and probably Chris I think what he knows he has to be more aggressive as I said when he had to defend at a high level he wasn't able to get into the game comfortably Rozier missed it here comes Indiana running but Rozier missed it because it was well challenged by Ma Halton dancing out front they have the double on him with Herro and love you see they they'll on this side of the floor coming to his right they they'll do that Sheppard again for three this time it's off and love the rebound Pacers have an early eight-point lead Miami just two of 10 from the field Adebayo missed it but he's fouled that's should be on Siakam tomorrow Wednesday at Houston Friday at Milwaukee I'm sure Rick um had strong words I for this team I I really do he had strong words for the team I believe after the game last night uh two nights ago I'm sorry and and and practice yesterday um really because the thing that was most disturbing I think to all of us were the fans here unknowledgeable yeah and at two puns in the course of that game Rick acknowledged there were Boo and that's more of a function of of of effort um from from the fans than it is whether or not you absolutely are are are getting stuff done are you are you trying hard enough are you competing Haliburton drives on Rozier gets inside up off the glass two strong love has another rebound that's his third trailing is love for three oo Kevin Love makes it a three-point game Alberton stop and go goes inside off the glass got it for his first points averaging 16 points per game Haliburton in his fifth year acers early by five they jumped out about 8 nothing to start Obi Toppin is in he was Indiana's leading score on Friday night with 21 points the season High here's love again Kevin Love always been able to shoot it I mean I thought the first two were online they were just short right there don't don't Turner for three that rims out the think oo Myles was a little indecisive as to whether he can get back oh my goodness well don't leave Herro well it the pass was thrown so badly I'm not sure SHP knew who was going to be anywhere six to shoot Herro off the screen good reaction by toen and now Sheppard 43 Pacers get it back they get an offensive rebound and Haliburton at The Rim missed it challenged by his old youth basketball AA teammate Tyler Herro and Wisconsin that's no good here comes Indiana running top and catches top and dunks few people in the big in this in the league Chris can get out and run being that size I that big 610 he can really get out and run in the lanes Pacers already with five fast break points for the longest time on Friday night it was a big Miami advantage in fact it was 14 to one at one point good hands by Haliburton hiy Jaquez is in Baseline to Highsmith F on top Obi has called for his first it's the third team fou against Indiana Nikola Jovic is in third year out of Serbia he had 11 points on Off the Bench he's a problem yeah he was cuz he's got size so he'll get out in out to Jovic who sets for three rebounded by matth stay on the attack this is where to P that's that's the only way to do it you got to stay on the attack when you hit the ball aine has it goes right around Jaquez inside draws the foul mind you these two played against each other in college so there's a certain psyche that goes with if a guy you've been beating in college at UCLA obviously and mine what a little extra conversation little little uh yeah Mathurin at the line Herro was behind him behind the three-point art chattering no no when I talked to him he was at the foul out he wasn't behind the last they they they were talking to each other he's moving away now but he was in front of him talking there you go just that's the right thing ignore it jars Walker is in for the first time Mathurin and Haliburton two starters with McConnell Toppin and Walker Jarace was in double figures on Friday night 11 points and a season High seven rebounds and Mathurin already six first quarter points and has hit all four of his free throws nice job by toin really good job that's just that's just a big time shot because when you're talking about Rozier he's under signs at about 6'3 top and 610 and top Rozier was still able to get a good shot off not a good shot a shot he could make it was not sure it was a good shot toen great pass I mean great pass he was going to pass that to the corner and at the last minute was able to get it to Walker at The Rim he was in the air with that terrific pass as you said he had to make up his mind quickly Walker has points Off the Bench Toppin points Off the Bench Rozier in trouble short three and a half to play Walker shot fake Baseline and top and missed it tipped it up no good get back that's the only thing to do once you miss that shot is get back that keeps him from running Pacers have missed a couple at the rim Jaquez and they're going to call a foul out from second one on on top of Myles stepping away from the basket opens that up a little bit little full court pressure here Pacers have to get it across and they just do with McConnell you have 8 seconds to get across that line Pacers in their City uniforms for the first time oh man question that's Josh Richardson who checked in the heat back in 2015 played four years in Miami then has played in Philadelphia Dallas Boston San Antonio and New Orleans back in Miami for a second straight year Duncan Robinson guarding McConnell his size created an issue there and now they nearly throw it out of bounds Jovic Jaquez Robinson Richardson Adebayo Siakam has come back in for the Pacers Jaquez way short he's not a good three-point shooter see one of the things Miami can do is they can play uh Jovic on Myles yeah there you go take you beat him on the elbow he still made it SE a Siakam come his first shot goes in so it's important you see where those opportunities are Rick is always done a really good job Rick's a terrific coach I don't mean probably seen other than he is but taking advantage of mismatches is the thing that you've got to be able to do out ofo no good there's Turner with the rebound after taking doing a nice job defensively and hitting Adebayo take a tough shot Pacers looking for a double figure lead keep the ball keep the ball Siakam again and it falls the soft touch from Pascal Siakam he only shot I mean over the last three or four games he he really hadn't been taking a lot of shots chis at 13 14 he needs to be looking at getting 16 18 shots a game yeah you're right in the last two games combined as Richardson hits the jumper just 25 field goal attempts for Pascal Siakam he was eight of 11 in Orlando six of 14 on Friday night 22.5 the over minus 115 the under minus 113 nice job cuz this is another guy that got away from the PTI Duncan Robinson cuz he can shoot it he he knocks down shots he and Herro are two of the best three-point Shooters in the league great range from Duncan Robinson in his seventh year out of Michigan the Pacers 10-point lead cut in half o didn't quite good get there Siakam for three well he has shot it at a high level Quin 46% on the year he's played at a high level I think all year he's the one guy that's been very consistent with his offense Jovic short Walker there for the rebound final 28 seconds of the first half he's asking for this is this is what I like about what Siakam he asked for the ball give it to him and give it back give it back to him let him go to work and that ball is loose and it's picked up by hawz taken by McConnell be smart because you only got six seconds be smart McConnell 3 seconds two one blocked by Richardson they're starting to pay a lot more attention Duncan Robinson tipped it out of bounds let's set the lineup Sheppard McConnell Walker Siakam and Turner for the Pacers Jovic Adebayo Robinson hwz and Richardson and Richardson the steel Robinson for three that's why you can't turn it over and that was one and Chris it was close to be and you almost have to consider it holding on to the ball cuz it would have been 5 Seconds what happened in last game I think the Pacers had um something like 20 turnovers but 12 of those were Ste so those a live ball turnovers in the middle of that zone McConnell top 20 in field goal percentage this year at 56% he was 17th last year when he also shot 56% Robinson turns the corner chased out to hwz nice job getting back from by Siakam got him battled up and that's a shot clock violation heading bottled up that's good defense defense solid one of the things you had to have is the ability to defend it at a high level read here their Zone TJ goes right through the middle of it gets see putting a lot of pressure on what they're trying not to do is let the Pacers get the ball up the T too quick see he's had the ball the shot clock's already at eight and TJ had the ball into a second ago now you got more dribbling this is when the Pacers get in trouble and Walker had to shoot it over Jovic cuz he held the ball unfort he had to shoot it over Jovic and they come back and score on the other end that's why Rick's taking the timeout cuz the ball stop moving the Miami Heat I got a hat in the in the color of the uh indie and that's going to be a Pacers turnover so back toback turnovers got to be alert you're put listen this team puts defensive pressure on you all over the floor conditioning standpoint the guys he's starting out against are the best it's not like their second unit and I think that's been a little bit why he hadn't had his much of his legs because he's had to work so much harder and that they're going to say it's a kick ball and again you see we we talked early on when the season started the the Pacers great strength their depth and they are without four players Aaron D Smith and Andrew NIMH hard they're two best perimeter Defenders and that's Duncan Robinson you know he got around and dun did that dunk I going to say Duncan he got that over Myles they have cut I should say around Myles I don't think you can get it over Myles they have cut what was a 10-point Pacers lead to two Jarace Walker no good and that's Miami ball when you mentioned it second quarters have been an issue for the Pacers this year yeah they just got to keep doing what what got him there mishandled thank goodness cuz Adebayo threw a heck of a pass pounds it take that one take that one Myles Turner I mean you went a plunk that on the head great pass great F by Walker leading that break outo had 30 in his 500th game on Friday night maybe one of the best games of his career it was I'm going to tell you he was a handful takes real real pride in this though in the in the defense and he's strong enough that's why they put him on Siakam it up guys and it was a defensive 3 second violation against Miami but Walker misses the free throw how do Walker get up there to shoot second guy get up to shoot the free throw Siakam mine wasn't in I would have said him but he wasn't in tyres Haliburton is back in and he got a good break yeah there you go find it he's going to spin on oh that's in it was going to be be goal tending anyway but the ball went in over first and now sakam a chance for a three-point play and it become the first Pacer or Heat player in double figures nine points for Siakam four of four from the field one of one from three as Tai is getting his if you will his legs if you were from the Olympics Siakam has been the one that's been most steady nice pressure by the Pacers almost a 5sec on this end Walker was up as was Haliburton pressuring the ball Siakam leads the Pacers in scoring it almost 20 per game Richardson the drive with a left hand wild shot rebounded by Turner Siakam pushes and now Turner trailing for three he's made three of them tonight he also was very aggressive on that other end when he stopped an easy bucket and that's what allowed the Pacers to get out was Friday night had nine points and five rebounds had a little uh playing around with Herro and Haliburton as the ball was the ti to come inad these guys they weren't laughing Haliburton wasn't laughing Herro was playing to grab his jersey it's knocked out of there Herro is back in Obi toppin has come back in for the Pacers that's because I believe Adebayo went out right in half and Highsmith missed it well he didn't miss anything on Friday night oh cutting Jackson oh okay we we got a little Wisconsin thing going on here that's what he used to do to it too oh I'm sorry that's I that's Robinson 4130 Indiana by 11 their largest lead and now Herro missed it Walker The Rebound acers in their City Edition uniform for the first time he knows he can't guard him he knows he can't guard him Walker to toen his three too strong Robinson they're going to be short one Robinson decked him over there and now yich hits the three that's really what has kept Miami close Quinn they're only but they're six of 13 from three they've missed some easy shots too and that that's what worries me cuz they've had shots that they should make a Alberton no good rebound good job out o Robinson tipped that good hands by Jackson great not only good hands great might be a basket that's great effort Rozier has come back in Jovic adds off keep pushing it keep pushing iter and and Walker missed it tipped it up no good got got to get back they got numbers when the Pacers have missed a lot of shots at The Rim as well Robinson to a cutting Jovic he's fouled from behind by Haliburtong they have five and six Indiana is five and seven Jovic had 11 on Friday night he's got four tonight Jovic has five Off the Bench he has started eight of the 12 games he's played this year Jovic is averaging eight points per game he's guarding topen oh great catch see a gets it back Siakam is a little bit bigger see he he's a little bit bigger Halton to the corner he had to shoot it shot clock was Ben Sheppard is up off the Indiana bench he'll check in you can see at the scores table next dead ball heo sto and go Robinson he's hit three of those Quinn he's got 11 you can't help off but I mean you can't even be in help position off of it Pacers led by 11 and now it's eight straight points before Siakam answers a great s there ball got pushed up by hton and he attracted all kind of attention Siakam has 12 he is perfect five of five from the field here's another deep three this time barely hit the rim you call that is that a heat check a little bit Yeah cuz you're right he was deep Jackson right back to Haliburton which is exactly what he should do but the ball is hopping a lot more today here's a three Siakam no good and it hit the end line so it's Miami's we really saw Indiana use just eight players but they've used nine tonight with Jackson we saw Fury a little bit well that was at that point Rick was tired yeah he was tired of seeing what he saw he substituted all five starters a couple of times Jovic three to shoot he got to the Rim used his size I'm telling you and he was well defended that's a rim run there by toen who was able to take advantage of the undersiz Herro under the basket but that running to the rim forces the defense to collapse good nice job there sixth assist for Haliburton Highsmith Jovic another drive with a left hand he missed that the rebound though comes to Rozier Highsmith short Rozier the rebound and he got it come back up with the left hand Pacers couldn't get to him offensive rebounds for this year that's been a challenge got him again got it got under the side I think y got a piece of that now he's got to get back they got a five on four Hero's going to launch and miss a three the long rebound Robinson saves it Herro again nice job by toen to get the hand of here otherwise he's got an easy tap Mathurin all the way to the basket lays it in second field goal for Benedict Mathurin he has eight 4742 Pacers they've led by as many as 11 they have not trailed and Eric spola takes a Miami timeout 327 to play second quarter bad throw to the tow boy and came back you know some guys do that and they don't they just keep walking Tai came all the way back to make sure you said I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that it's taken by SE too little too late and there it is 10,000 points for Pascal Siakam Duncan Robinson just got a technical because he felt like the official didn't make a call on that steel and started chirping and the official got it for a technical so Pascal Siakam the steel in the basket and 10,000 in his NBA career Pacers Now by eight 310 to play alongside Quinn Buckner I'm Christen Ary our director Jamie Burns our technical director Mike Stevens and our producer Brian woodam glad you're with us on this Sunday three Road games this week Pacers basketball busy another steal Mathurin he got it top of the backboard he got it got it thought he got bumped we haven't seen I haven't seen any like that at least not lately James Johnson was in front of us he couldn't believe it went in taken away defense second time I mean not second time but second possession in a row where the defense gives you a chance to score Mathurin rifled pass too hard to Sheppard and out ofo so it's Miami that converts off the Pacers turnover two minutes to play first half a first half the Pacers have never trailed they're in a Zone it's a it's like a one two two zone so if you can attack it at all in the middle you got some you get some good things happening he's going he'll go to work Mathurin step back off the glass and that's a shot clock violation violation hit the corner yeah your top corner I mean that was nowhere near the square that's that long three-point miss that AO tracks down he's got Myles is in good position he's going to play B is going to play like that I mean that's just a better shot is yeah what he's a what he's learned he can he can take the ball and even when he gets bumped he's he finds a way to stay on back oh thank you Tyrese Haliburton's teammate on the Olympic team in Paris Eric spoler was an assistant to Steve cerr there's the double into the corner seum now to Mathurin for three he got his own rebound a heck of a catch that was a bad pass then don't don't right there he did right had the right shot he just missed it Herro with a left- hand pass Rozier oh boy and Herro hits the three just his second field goal in his first three that's a three-point Pacers lead with the shot clock and game clock about a 3 second difference I said oh boy cuz I can see Herro stepping into that shot he was going to be clear it was just like he practicing Chevy halftime show on the way with JJ and Eddie Zone and slow this offense up a little bit that's in and out no good AO the rebound 5 Seconds stay in front of him oh he carried the ball no question but that's C of the pressure been a heavy gain of uh game of runs the Pacers is a 7even nothing run to lead by 10 Miami has scored the last seven to cut it to three Indiana with 2.7 Haliburton gets it away and nearly banked it in but I like the energy thank you JJ thank you Jim Pacers have the ball to start the third quarter they've not trailed tonight Sheppard wanted to reload the three good defense byamy shot clock at six Sheppard couldn't shoot that because he's there's love was right there but but very much what coach ban said got to get much of the same thing just get back in transition Pacers didn't turn the ball over very much in that um in in that half Chris and it makes a big difference CU to keeps Miami from third quarter was big for the heat on Friday night that's when they took command and built a 22-point lead Adebayo in the corner for three and it's no good love there tips it Siakam tipped it to Hur hbert had six first half points he had six assists and he goes inside and left it short he's shot it across his body and never could get himself headed toward the rim and Rozier makes it a one-point game they scor the game's last nine yeah well Rozier does a terrific job particularly if he goes left he can shoot that one-handed layup effectively Turner goes inside and the basket and a foul mil Turner Myles Turner after just nine on Friday night already with 13 hean said he got all leing back to the latter stages of the first half for Miami that was after the Pacers had taken a 10-point lead on a 7 nothing run you just can never let up against this Miami team they keep the pressure on you in all aspects fourth straight game they're playing without Jimmy Butler what's interesting this year they are two and one without Butler short and that ball loose picked up by Sheppard on the ground that's the kind of compete you got to have those are the moments Turner to the basket fooled him they didn't think he big fellow was going to get from that three-point line to the basket so five quick points by Myles Turner and the Pacers have a six-point lead two Wisconsin natives out there Haliburton and guarding Herro they slide it outo and he got the basket and a foul he was behind the bio when he caught it and that was going to be a tough one on Friday night in the second half and that's one of the things I thought he did great Chris wasn't so much the two threes he made yeah you got away with traveling but I think he all night he was like eight or nine from the fou you're right you you're spot on he was getting to the free thrille line and convered and he's only a 70% free throw shooter well they're getting out what they're doing to the Pati they're covering that three-point line Turner's got to go to work and he luckily I think he got five cuz you're right you could hear the coaching staff counting out counting down shot clock was down to inside two seconds patience that's the second team foul on Miami it's the second on Rozier we're standing this is like a 3-2 Zone at the top Mathurin with the three that's why they put him there because against that zone They don't put anybody particularly on the ball and particularly so you you you got a spotted that's that's dead and they didn't come out to get M him he's shooting 44% from three-point range 10 percentage points higher in his career Sheppard got there too late well he was trying to recover a long way what that's one of the things you goir off the screen misses Adebayo the offensive rebound they've got 10 offensive rebounds Rozier no good put up no good by Adebayo got numbers two two of them back Haliburton is open his three is tipped in by Turner oh Adebayo seven in the quarter and he blocked the shot and he Smith lost it out of bounds Pacers have a chance five on four Mathurin for three Pacers by eight they've lit by as many as 11 now he can still post he can still post and the bench was standing up they were screaming they knew you need a double team I know he's in in basketball P he's ancient but he's still an effective poster and here's Turner off a dime pass left-handed from Seattle nine of his 20 in this quarter and the Pacers by eight 6456 they had a pair of double doubles a year ago against the Heat including 22 and 13 here at gamebridge Fieldhouse shot clock down to two down to one Rozier launches and it hit the rim taken by Mathurin long rebound this time the Pacers got it you got it back to him right there Siakam for three counted the time out 17 for Siakam and the Pacers have matched a game high 11-point leader back from a Pacers lead they brought Josh Richardson and hiy hawaz in along with Herro Rozier and Adebayo Herro Pacers ball you can see the pride in which Haliburton they wanted to get the ball up but but there was a little celebration there by Haliburton because of the good defense he played that time no change for the Pacers their five starters on the floor Mathurin high low goes to Siakam in the corner Sheppard for three had a good look at it it was a good play just just the ball didn't go in it was a good play Pacers eight of 19 from three out of B of the drive met there by Turner got it back with six to shoot good defense here by Turner halfway through the third quarter here on a Sunday in Indianapolis back home next Sunday again inside Siakam from Haliburton and a 13-point Pacers lead Pacers have not Trail tonight they scored the game's first eight six of those on two threes by Turner no good by Richardson Mathurin turns the corner stop and go to the basket and that's a foul on Josh richardsoni Tyrese has done a really good job on the defensive end but you know on offense he finds players does a good job getting the ball quickly inside the Siakam had I thought an easy basket but the basket was Made Easy by the pass threw him open and by that I mean he threw to the open area where Siakam had to go get it and when he caught it he was open at the rim and Tyrese with 10 assists tonight seventh time this year in the first 13 games he's had double figure assist playing freely Mathurin at the free throw line and now a message from galito and Daly injured at work Myles Turner will leave with nine of his 20 in this quarter Adebayo will leave so that means Turner will leave Toppin is in and Jovic has come in for Miami six of six at the free throw line for Benedict Mathurin and the Pacers have opened up a 15-point lead they're on a 14-2 run Herro lost it yeah he lost it CU some put good ball pressure by his Sheppard Pacers thus far have done a nice job on Herro he only has five points Jovic missed it rebound tipped away Sheppard OB to and turned jerus Walker gone yeah jerus Walker is in he had a couple of points in the first half Walker played 10 minutes off the bench top and nine McConnell eight and they got three minutes from Clinton Jackson and Herro hits he'll have a chance for four with at least two or more threes couple of games ago he made a career high tying 10 he had 40 Tuesday night in their cup loss at Detroit they lost in overtime that game Quinn and I talk about Friday night Eric spuler called a timeout in overtime he didn't have highly unusual for him to do something like that 17 years as a coach he'll he'll tell you that that's one of the big mistakes he's made jerus Walker in the corner no good Pacers have to be careful they got that 15-point lead Miami's made some significant runs tonight though they've not LED this guy can heat up he missed it Haw has the rebound that's really the key you got to rebound the ball they have 13 offensive rebounds Alberton got that rebound yeah you got to rebound the ball nice get it to him quickly he's got the same shot Walker this time a different result well he he sided well the other night he's been shooting it well from the three-point line he unfortunately had a tough night in terms of handling the ball picked up a few turnovers that's the 11th assist for Haliburton Rozier no good walker there to scoop up the rebound DJ McConnell's out there with Haliburton in the back court Mathurin inside off the glass and got it Benedict Mathurin and the Indiana Pacers have a 16-point days game they planned on showing them clips of things they did well because he said it's important to show you where you make mistakes but also when it works how it works so that was part of the film study after Friday's game thanks JJ is Adebayo hits the jumper Jeremiah Johnson on the Indiana Farm Bure Insurance sideline there's McConnell who's referencing with the ball with Haliburton Mathurin Walker and Turner Halton gets inside and he draws the foul on Jovic dener I don't know of course I wouldn't remember if I remember you don't think I'd say anything do you Haliburton with his first free throw it's good and let's step aside a word from b ty come get the uniforms you heard Jeremiah Johnson earlier tonight say some 20 games they'll wear them home and on the road and when they wear them at home it's the city Edition floor that looks so great for a second consecutive year Jovic his three is good he's a great catch and shoot shoter he's a he's a good player I mean he's a spot player but he can do a lot of things and in a couple years he'll be tough to deal with course he's got size but he's got great footwork he was a first round draft pick a couple of years ago 27th pick in his third year out of Serbia see they just tried to post Myles on it and Myles couldn't post it the same got it just made a three Walker stepped out of bounds Indiana's eighth turnover and Miami has taken advantage of the few turnovers the Pacers have 16 points off turnovers tonight for Miami they had 20 points off turnovers on Friday night the heat shooting just 36% and 33% from three like the pressure I mean they they haven't gotten below the three-point line yet they lob it up and otobo puts it down yeah Myles will have to make a decision he either stays with aobo and let the jump shot go or he has a challenge the jump shot if it's not a jump shot they make a jump pass abberton had Robinson on his hip here's a three by Turner it's short long rebound McConnell yeah 14 on the reset on an offensive rebound Turner on the post missed it but drew the foul count the basket is it a foul or I can't as you take a look at Eric exposer coach Carla was trying to call a timeout except it's Miami's ball you can't call when Miami's taking the ball out after a basket Richardson out ofo a buck he is doing he is doing what he did in the second half tonight he's got 10 of his 18 in this quarter and pressure by the heat good pass screen and roll ball Advan the corner of Myles reading Toppin quickly diving to the hoop Obi Toppin has six he a season High 21 Friday nightz drives inside and he gets to the rim he he hadn't done much but you got to watching because he he's sneaking in with the scoring yeah those are his first points Walker against Robinson bottled up we got and he threw the foul fortunately it's on Robinson so Robinson the foul that's the fifth so free throws now for the Pacers penalty and effect let this game but think about the potential guard forward rotation for tomorrow night second half of the back-to-back in Toronto so Ben Sheard will not return to this game all right that's why Quinn Jackson's going in the game yeah I'm not surprised and N Smith is out but one of the things that you know you and I were talking about they they got to give tie a break and and we were talking about Ben Sheppard but Ben Sheppard had been playing against backup player I'm telling you it is very different it's much more strenuous um and and you're trying to defend them and do what you do and I think that's just part of of what just happened to him AZ goes and has it blocked by Walker but I will tell you this about Jaime he will not back down and that's the way the Pacers have to be with the same attitude getting ready to turn and run and top and was right behind and unintended he rolled his ankle offensive rebound Turner put it in and HZ yeah he's hurt he is not making any effort to come down come to come off the floor and Eric spoler uses his sixth timeout he has those things that's all of your weight is about to go on that foot and H has was just just there's not much you can do Jimmy Butler there uh is out as well today he doesn't have a mask on he was you know trying to be the mask man much like Jovic yeah he wore the mask Friday night in honor of his teammate ni yich now Butler during the day was listed as questionable but then prior to the game ruled as out for Eric spoler team they're in the first out of a back toback like the Pacers get this tonight is the Sixth and final game of a 12 game road trip they're back home tomorrow night against Philadelphia Herro Robinson Richardson Jovic and out ofo I mean TJ got popped on the pick by Adebayo and TJ's tough but it I mean it cleared him Duncan Robinson's hit four of Miami's 12 threes and the lead is 10 8575 this is one advantage of having Walker he's got sides and he can handle the ball now he's just got to learn to make really good decisions okay that was a bad decision and he struggled with decisions uh in the last contest where he had seven seven turnovers he's got to make better decisions the Pacers and we we know what the heat can do they're they're always in Striking differences and the reason is Chris they're such a a good defensive team nice job there by walkeron Jackson starts the fourth quarter that's go Sheppard play anym out ofo misses rebound by Walker Walker McConnell Toppin Turner Jackson he's do to get Donald help gets it way up top now to Turner seconds okay somehow Topp and got it back and McConnell scores that's a good sign when you find a way to come up with a ball that essentially should be theirs and then you get a bucket out of it that's a good sign you got to capitalize on it great work there by both of those Pacers to give them a 12-point lead Robinson on the basine Richard it's on Turner DJ McConnell in his six season with the Pacers fighting over the screen that's on Quenton Jackson Quenton Jackson playing in his fifth game played in a handful of games a year ago was acquired by Indiana on a two-way contract late last year he's on a two-way contract with Enrique Freeman and Tristan Newton a pair of rookies the Pacers got in the draft Herro looked at a long three shot clock down to five Robinson turns the corner into the corner one Jackson flew by and Herro hit the three Tyler Herro has three of them got 12 TOA needs some help yeah he got it out of there too Turner really fighting with Richardson here's McConnell got it to Myles and hits 26 for Turner Herro gets an open three and hits again yeah hey you can't hit a screen and go to on Herro you got to play him I mean I don't care what happens you got to make sure you get up on him Miami is only shooting 39 and 12% from the field but 41% from distance they've made 14 threes Turner missed it rebound comes out to Robinson the Indiana lead was 16 it's been cut to eight and Robinson is fouled by Jackson That's that's another final he picked up there and that's almost the same kind of f remember Sheppard got hard to stop me you're chasing these guys coming off the three-point line Jackson brings you great energy but on this one it's one you got to get there late Pacers out scored the heat 3326 in the third quarter led by 10 after three earlier had a 12-point lead but Robinson cutting into that and a message from Rally House get ready for tip off some big numbers for Duncan Robinson tough spot to put Jackson in the game but he had to come in and he did you know he did what you would expect he got some uh two unexpected fouls both on three-point shots all three free throws for Robinson 6 and a half 17 in the game and the Pacers lead is just five Chris historically the Pacers playing the Heat is always a close game atherine came back in for Jackson Dr from fire it's on Siakam you sure had it not on matter let's see there they're saying Siakam on the screen yeah Albert is come back in Robinson to the wing they put size out there Siakam Herro too late no good Siakam the rebound running Indiana they lob it up and toen throws it down you don't have many in the league that can get up and down the floor with size like toin who went over the top for that one Tyrese Haliburton is 12th assist out ofo again for three telling he's really become a good three-point shooter he he couldn't do any of this two years ago see aam goes inside up that was a foul yeah that's no doubt that's a foul hit him on you could tell the way the ball came out of his hand I mean just a really good job kind of 10,000 he got fouled by just staying active here M the stor on the other end and they've been hunting threes between Adebayo Robinson and Herro Haliburton and the free throw good now a message from auto owners insurance auto owners thinks the more you protect Pacers had the Raptors tomorrow night they are just 2 and 12 on the year but last night Celtics had to make a buzzer beater by Jason Tatum to beat the Raptors in Boston don't go away he ball fakes you you you you got to stay up and that's what what coach car was going to tell you if you make a mistake second half points it's important to come out of this time I get a good shot Chris because the Pacers have really struggled you know look how much time they're taking to get a decent shot here Mathurin he's going to step through and get the legay up that's big really is the fact that ladies and gentlemen boys and girls he came to a twoot stop initially allowed him take one more step after he gathered the ball to get a layup he's got 19 Mo let face this ball you see out come knock ooh Siakam knocked that didn't he knock that off his leg wait a minute he knocked it off his leg they're going to challenge this yeah they're going to challenge it it's off his leg what I thought about it you know I give my little two cents worth but no it's it's much more sophisticated than than that now well I'm telling you what though you are a guy that used to pressure so you can handle that I don't call it pressure you just see what you you know how it is you call the same thing you just see what you see shot clock down to four Mathurin has to go to work they've got a double on that's not going to get up McConnell gets it away and a foul Lo B on Siakam that was another possession that would deepen the shot clock yeah it sure was and it's one when M the problem is penalty yeah at the L that's the fifth fifth of the quarter and we still have 620 to play and Miami is a perfect 13 of 13 at the line Jovic back to back double figure games off the bench for Miami he had 11 on Friday 11 tonight and now with 12 boy I tell you what in two years he's really he's helping him now two years he's really going to help him he's only 21 years old right he's he's a young man hand off to Siakam he's guarded by Robinson McConnell but you got to get something going to the basket see this the paac is on the perimeter and the shot clock at five here's Haliburton out to Turner Turner's got to shoot it quick and the ball tipped out of bounds PES ball shouldn't it oh Miami and now halfway through the quarter Miami has it with a chance to tie this is one of those moments on the defensive end that and ericos knows it you need to get a stop Indiana has led the entire game oh they see thech Robinson comes off that screen and we're tied oh you can see him come off that screen Now ladies and gentlemen Siakam with links couldn't get there first tie of the game the Pacers scored the game's first eight and never have trailed Siakam in trouble nice job to come bail him out he was about to get 3 seconds Turner for three McConnell with the loose ball Haliburton give me one give me one give me one yet give me three Tyrese Haliburton from the hustle play of McConnell Indiana by three less than five to play Robinson again well guarded that time by McConnell they use that high ball screen with AO Jovic McConnell smallest on the floor the rebound got didn't give it to him there got another one Tyrese back to back threes by Tyrese Haliburton urging the 16,000 plus to get on their feet Herro fouled and it's on McConnell two big threes by Tyrese Haliburton really good job but he's got a ball handle on the floor but look he better at home than he is on the road but I'm glad to see he's come alive here 16 and 12 he's shooting just 29% on the year from three-point range he is three of seven tonight but two big back toback threes by Haliburton as Rozier checks in a little smaller yeah goes out there go a little smaller they've got Jovic AO Robinson Herro and Rozier and all five can shoot to three yeah and Jovic is big enough this is part of the reason he's in he's yeah he can guard Myles Turner because they put Adebayo on Siakam that's why we haven't heard M clak out of Burton dancing here's another three it hits short well he was feeling it that was a tough shot but that was a heat check as well four minutes to play Pacers trying to even the season series after losing the NBA Cup game here on Friday Herro on the Baseline rebound by Mathurin he climbed the ladder and Jovic fouling thir takes that mask off momentarily really good challenge there and coming over the top his m qu that's his ninth rebound they've asked him to be a better rebounder and he has responded another clutch game for the Pacers inside five fivepoint game here's Mathurin got there and he draws the foul and so at that point I was looking cuz I thought he was about to have a double double at the line just shy of 20 points per game he was almost at 20 at 19.9 he's at 18.8 coming in and his free throw was good he's got 20 for the seventh time this year I mean this is a big difference from what you had as you have the game night special oh nice fleece it's the Indiana Pacers Cosmos hooded flee shop tonight's exclusive game night special and more online at Pacers team store.com it's the city Edition game night special you said I I I think I saw you you you were I got one of the heads yeah oh this sweet and I don't usually wear heads than other than in muted colors but I like this color three and a half to play six-point Pacers lead he had one tie and then Haliburton hit back to back threes Jovic out of a with five to shoot and he got it another big second half for bam Adebayo he's got 235 in the second half you got to play quick with these guys if we get in the scrum with them they that's how they play Turner catch shoot three by Myles Turner land with confidence fourth of the night for turner He's got 29 you got you got to go and Siakam called for the foul his fifth IO stays at 23 250 to play Pacers lead the league in clutch games this is their 10th 10 of their first 13 they are five and four trying for a sixth win one of two for Adebayo the Nan hbert in the ball Rozier the good thing about it you got another ball handler is TJ mcconell that really would slow up the offense if you only have one ball handle in could get the ball back to him with Herro mconnell goes inside big play Big play rebound tipped there's the 10th rebound Mathurin well Adebayo yeah Adebayo got away with a foul and Turner was standing outabounds the year he had three coming into the season part of the Improvement Chris Robinson guarded by Mathurin you got to get up Myles and he missed it rebound tipped Turner tips it to Mathurin I like it cuz he was aggressive going after the rebound probably could have got an offensive foul but at this point just be aggressive two minutes to play give it back to Siakam let him go to work inside Siakam adds two more he's got 23 from the time he got to his spot you could see the Rhythm that he was in and Herro just still that drilled six of them tonight for Tyler Herro they've hit 18 threes 97 get the play Pacers by five Siakam got out of B to bite mconnell that's a from the time he got to his spot you could see the Rhythm and Duncan Robinson if you're going to do anything you let the other whomever the screen is you let them be the ones that open oh no no no no no no and he's out that's on Siakam that's his sixth he'll be topping this up off the bench to check in the night is over for Pascal Siakam 23 points nine of 11 from the field four rebounds and two assists continues to put up huge numbers for the Pacers both teams have three players with at least 20 points Turner 32 Siakam 23 mathin 21 for the heat 28 for Herro 24 for Adebayo and 20 for Duncan Robinson 193s tonight for Miami that's the second most they've made in a game this year they have made 20 and they've been brilliant at the free throw line 18 of 19 Jovic five of five now six of six you're going to need a little help cuz they they've got full court pressure got to get it in good call good call really good call that's why you like your point guard taking the ball out cuz they have Pacers have one timeout remaining Miami has none you can throw it deep into the back court and that's where McConnell gets it he's going to go all the way to the basket and lay it in good a nice job job they knew they were going to face a front if you will Tyrese Haliburton but McConnell very good just reacted Adebayo Richardson the rebound Topp and stumbled now Robinson is looking job by Haliburton who came across and got that block and that should do it for the Pacers with 23 seconds to play Turner is going to put a cap on it moments tonight the Pacers have really stepped up Chris got the block when you needed to get it and Toppin and the Pacers will snap a two game losing streak and answer Friday night's loss here to the heat with a 119 110 it was an embarrassing loss it was just a loss they came back
