 and we welcome you into the desert we are in Phoenix Arizona for a big time Showdown the Wolves and the Suns for a second time this season the first time these two teams got together it was at Target Center in Minneapolis when this happened what a moment there at Target Center first signature moment for Julius Randle in a Timberwolves uniform welcome into footprint Center alongside the Jim Peterson I'm Michael Grady really excited about this matchup tonight but let's go back to that first match up Randle 35 points he was a monster he's going to have to be a monster in this game tonight as well nicely here as The Season's gone on so between the passing with Rudy Gobert and his ability to score inside he's going to have to play Big minutes tonight that's all there is to it and so Julius is going to be really needed in this game for Anthony Edwards Michael he's going to have to be a great decision maker in this game he's going to see a lot of bodies they're going to do everything they can to get the ball out of his hand and so ant's going to have to be really sharp so not only aggressive but when they trap him and get the ball out of his hands he's got to make great decisions well the Phoenix Suns we know they have a three-headed monster although one of them is now coming off the bench but in the starting lineup it's still all about Kevin Durant who is going to play in this ball game he was questionable with the thumb injury but it's Durant and Devin Booker he's the easy he's the Easy Money Sniper and so there're just nobody that has scored the basketball more effortlessly than Kevin Durant but for Devin Booker you know he's a mid-range Maven just like Durant is you think about Devin Booker his three-point shooting is fine like he's he's a career 35% three-point shooter but his ability to make shots from all over the floor is UN unmatched in the league from the two guard position he's excellent and for Kevin Durant he's one always one of the league leaders Michael in not only just mid-range attempts but also a field goal percentage as well he's one of the 50% guys from mid-range and then obviously the three point shootings there the arena attacks it's going to be interesting to watch him play tonight yes it will well injury update wolves trying to stay healthy back in a moment away here at footprint Center pralis flashback to Monday this was the win over the Atlanta Hawks and it was a win but we thought for a moment it might come at a loss Nickeil Alexander Walker Key Reserve Landing awkwardly and needed to be helped off the floor as it turns out it was a leg contusion he's not only playing tonight he wasn't even on the status support he is a full go earlier Chris Finch talked about what a relief it was that Nickeil is good to go certainly um you know he's been so important for us this year um you know and you know just thankfully it was kind of like a a a stinger injury and was able to to kind of Shake It Off in the and the the days that followed so um yeah really important so on the way starting lineups and the opening tip wolves Suns next on FanDuel ready to get started here at footprint Center let's get to our Chevrolet starting lineups we begin with Minnesota Mike Conley Anthony Edwards Jaden McDaniels Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert just three different starting lineup combinations this season for the Wolves lowest in the NBA for the Suns tus Jones Devin Booker Kevin Durant Royce O'neale and Nick Richards playing in his sixth game in a Sun's uniform and he was acquired from Charlotte Mike boser first season as Suns head coach has had to make some tough decisions moving Bradley Beal to the bench Jusuf nurkic recently to the bench and Chris Finch Jim Pete had to get on his guys after that Atlanta game Atlanta decimated by injuries and guys out for various reasons and that game actually came down to the wire and it was unacceptable for Chris Finch it really was and you know that's the way Finch's been since he's been here in Minnesota is that he's not played and not suffered fools and and he wants guys to play to their utmost and so sometimes it takes those tongue lashings to get guys to play at their best and so we'll see what happens here this evening you know they've really responded to Chris Michael when he's had those moments and you don't want to overdo it but I I thought it was a good move on his part wolves are four games above 500 for the first time this season the suns are on a three game winning streak these are two teams playing good basketball and having their second meeting of the Season we are underway Edwards turns the corner puts it up with the left and end do I love that first possession I mean running Anthony Edwards off of staggers like that off of little floppy action and so I'm sure that these teams are kind of Michael surprised that they have to cover floppy in their walk their walkthroughs at shoot around it's a play that is was very prominent early on in the NBA you know you know 5 10 years ago but Minnesota runs it fairly often and well executed bounce pass a little bit too low for Rudy Gobert it Ricochet off the sun's player and out of bounds so again flying off of that Baseline screening action curling into the painted area and finishing with not his strong hand but he prefers to go left I mean Anthony Edwards loves going with that left hand and finishes strong there McDaniels gets it to Edwards clock winding down going to have to make a play McDaniels for three got it how about that gets the hand grenade from Anthony that time and like I say sometimes it works out I mean you get a guy in the basketball like that where it's a must shoot situation Jaden knocks that one down McDaniels playing his best basketball Chris Finch highlighted earlier perhaps of his career Devin Booker with the Jay getting Phoenix on the scoreboard Jones has the assignment on Edwards Edwards in a crowd and his pass easily stolen by the Sun Royce O'neale for three no good and McDaniel snagging another rebound what a rebound McDaniels has been a rebounding machine this month Edwards and Durant teammates out in France over this summer winning gold together Edwards Off the Mark Booker now matched up with go Booker on the drive toss out Durant Corner three easy money you can say that again very few players has shot the ball better than Kevin Durant in the history of the NBA I mean he's just tremendous from all levels Randle no good and Randle had 35 points the last time these two teams got together a spectacular finish a few months ago at Target Center Durant crossover on the attack in the flush he still got it 36 years young fifth in the NBA in scoring Suns by two McDaniels three more off the heel the suns are just behind the wolves in the Western Conference standings a half game behind Booker working on Randle good defense and if they force a turnover again Kevin Durant left to right crossover I mean Julius isn't the only one to go for especially with the screening action that makes you react that way but so very quick left to right crossover Randle trying to go bully ball with O'neale has to force it out shot clock winding down again skip pass Conley that's a hand grenade and it goes off on the Wolves pretty good passing better defense that time to make Minnesota have to reload they closed out let's get to your a take for tonight Jim P ant's decision making he's going to have to adjust and so he's going to have to make great decisions and all the crapping actions like we've seen already and so no turnovers low turnovers for Anthony in this game then gar yard you must contain and contest shots we've already seen already all these great shot makers and then pick and R defense this has got to be a Rudy Gobert game it's got to be one of those games we go boy at the end of the night Rudy had one of his best games in the season for Minnesota to get this win Booker found the angle wolves hit their first two shots they've gone 0 for three with two turnovers since Edwards that's a good look at a three in and out go and they call him for a push from behind this going to be the first on go first team foul on the Wolves Gobert coming off backto back double doubles just a little shove in the back yeah pretty light contct but that's a tough match up for Mike Conley on an island with Kevin Durant and dump off to the newly acquired Nick Richards it's the number one way scor I mean he cutting so sitting along that Baseline just like that Kevin Durant finds him draws the defense he's cutting he's rolling in pick and roll game and then offensive rebound putbacks it was 5 nothing Minnesota the Suns of red off 11 straight Conley on the attack leaves it for Randle downhill with the leg the suns are 23rd in defensive rating in the NBA see if that's something Minnesota can take advantage of Richards kick out and is stolen by Randle Conley and Conley tried to get it to Edwards broken up by Alpha Valley's own tus Jones Booker in the lane kick out get back and now Jones have to set up the offense and Conley trying to get around Durant to get the steal picks up the foul first foul on Conley it's going to be the second team foul on the Wolves Richards with the easy Deuce Randle with his first score of the ball game Sun the game with window concept so talk about defense playing on a string so watch Rudy Gobert here in pick and roll game he's got a show on Devin Booker so that's going to force Richard into the roll and that activates the low man help and that's Jaden McDaniel so he's going to come over and take the roller which forc Mike's into cover but watch Julius Randle he's playing two he's playing Kevin Durant and he's playing Royce O'neale and he's just going to read the passer just a great job of everybody covering down like Mike covered down low man help was there to stop the roller that's what they have to do that's pick and a row coverage activation right there it is a four-point ball game Bradley Beal on the floor right now for the Suns he's just checked in for Royce O'neale Durant pocket pass Richards can't hit the short hook Randle the rebound great contest by Rudy Gobert Nick Richards is an excellent player I I really like this pickup for them but he's not quite as athletic as Daniel Gafford people are comparing it to Gafford last year with Dallas and that was certainly a big deal for the Mavericks along with PJ Washington but Richards is a little bigger than Gafford but not quite as athletic as Julius knocks down the jumper second field goal for Julius Randle this is Booker surrounded Rises and hits makes it look easy These Guys these guys knock down a lot of mid-range jumpers they are two of the highest he Kevin Durant two of the highest volume mid-range jump shooters Durant has been one of the best in the history of the league there's not a team in the league that takes and makes more jumpers than the Phoenix Suns and you see Bradley b is it safe to say that he is the most expensive six-man in the history of the NBA I would say it's pretty expensive but hey the you know the results speak for themselves they're six and three with him coming to the bench and actually he missed some games the record is actually better than that since he's gone the bench but he didn't play in some of the games that they won and so Bradley Bal you know his his numbers are very similar like just a few points less per game but bench players are so important and you know he's he's shooting it well he he's averaging 15 points since he's come off the bench he was a -6 in the plus minus as a starter this season Booker Goes Down Still knocks down the Jay he's in a Groove you remember de Booker while the suns were without Bradley Beal and Kevin Durant in Minneapolis earlier this season Booker had 44 points go turns inside and caught a body that is what I'm talking about Rudy Gobert 15-1 approaching the 5minute mark of the opening quarter oh double crossover Kevin Durant the hesi the floater and it finesses home plus the foul that was disgusting again Rudy on the roll so it pocket pass decision making do I pass it or do I score it and that time makes a really nice move he puts it on the floor reverse dribble throws it home and then that's just cold blooded I don't think I'm ever going to get tired and I have to we have to all as basketball fans appreciate what this man is as a basketball player and how much he loves the game so Chris fch got a technical foul and we have to go to our research Department Chris Finch gets animated and fired up a lot he doesn't get many technical FS he's pretty fired up right now I mean look at the intensity of his face right now he is locked in this is the team that not only swept the wolves in the regular season a season ago he's obviously fired up about the Atlanta game but this is also a Suns team uh that led to him getting his kneecap dislocated a season ago that is true so he just he's seeing all red when he sees purple and this is a big game we've talked about all these you know these games in for playoff positioning how important winning the series is sh clock winding down on Edwards in the corner hard drive the spin skip pass and it's out of bounds the Wolves struggling a little bit with this Sun's defense shot clock has been winding down an awful lot so Ry dunks it and the camera gets discombobulated wow that is force seven-point ball game wolves are going to be in the penalty the rest of the way Allen finds Durant up top early Luka a minutes with no Naas re tonight Booker can't hit from Deep Nill Alexander Walker s for Sor eyes on the floor Edwards slicing down the lane partially blocked by Mason Plumlee Booker the lob up top and o no no chemistry was not there on the alleyoop attempt here comes the wolves quickly the other way but now they'll set up the offense under four in the first Randle over to Alexander Walker no good on a three and Beal the board oh nice pass Plumlee can't finish wolves momentarily have numbers Plumlee not on the play right now cherry picking and there's a foul called on Grayson Allen and that's going to be the first on Allen second team foul on the side this game's going to be a study in next man up mentality is it safe to say that this is the first time we've seen this this group of five on the floor 100% Rob Dillingham nil Alexander Walker Jayden McDaniels Anthony Edwards and the five is Luka Garza slim on Slim got it back and put it in McDaniels for two he now has five points to go with three rebounds plumin now was Durant seven points in this first quarter and an offensive foul is going on the Suns it's on Mason Plumlee his first Minnesota's really dodged some bullets here they've had the lob dunk Miss and then they have the turnover after that now an offensive foul Jaden with the putb there next man mentality Michael in this game I mean LCA Garza is getting an up opportunity play and Rob Dillingham filling in for Donte Donte Divincenzo is going to get his opportunity extended minutes Edwards in a crowd and it's last Touch by the Suns no foul call 248 to go in the first quarter Timberwolves trailing by five back here Phoenix five-point lead for the Suns and a expressing his displeasure with official CJ Washington he was really upset with the officials at a no call on this previous drive and you judge at home was this a foul I mean he got F by Grayson Allen and by Plum I mean the question down was it a foul who you could to call it on yeah I mean you two choices yeah you got two choices there so you wonder why an get so upset too and he's going to keep attacking here he is again and he got the bucket and he still is he can't get a foul call and he's going to have to be careful he's going to pick up a technical Chris Finch already has a technical foul in this opening quarter is this a foul that's a foul he's getting r i mean I mean that's a foul W he's getting rid off his line by the defender there's illegal contact there three-point ball game Durant Rises over McDaniels and that is as a good a defense as you can play on Kevin Durant and he still knock down the jumper he has nine Dillingham sets up Garza long range money Luka Garza Mak an impact early the Phoenix is lead is two double comes Plumlee trying to bang with Edwards missed the shot Edwards the rebound Plumlee realized just how strong Edwards is Edwards pull up yes by the way shout out to our research Department 20 technical fouls for Chris Finch and his 5 years as head coach how about that including tonight including tonight Don the rookie knocks down the triple wolves are on a 9-2 run before that three by The Rook Garza again that time wide right and extra hustle there by Grayson Allen knocking it off of Dillingham and out of bounds 69 seconds remain in this opening frame wolves start to pick it up a little bit Royce O'neale back on the floor it's O'neale's First full season in Phoenix after being traded from Brooklyn a season ago Durant now matched up with Garza Durant rant trying to cross over picked up the dribble whips it over to Beal Beal in the lane the jumper is pure got three of them deal Booker and Durant all mid-range just incredible jump Shooters Big Time shot makers Edwards in the zone early working on D trying for the blow by and there is his foul call First in the final two minutes on the Suns and that's the first on Ryan D well whoever Luka gar is defending is that's who's going to be handling in pick and roll action for Kevin Durant they forced to switch that last possession so Chris Finch seeing that takes Luka gar out gets Julius back into the game here so they were hunting Luka that last possession Edwards needs somebody and he gets into Alexander Walker and good defense O'neale with the thievery and that's a travel no call done with the Layin perap may have felt the ball was deflected there nevertheless it's two points Dillingham a blur fouled by Bradley Beal and dillingham's going to go to the line for two contact with the ball oh my goodness what is going on here these are my guys too Pat FR Minnesota guy Kevin Cutler one of the great guys CJ Washington this this is a good refereeing crew let's get a quick word from Blaze Booker returns to the Suns line uping ran I'm on team Blaze I'm on team Blaze you're a person you're in a journey and Blaze wants to be a part of that go blaz go Blaze go Blaze Dillingham went to the free throw line for the first time in his career Monday against Atlanta missed both free throws knock down these two here to make it 2722 Beal step back this is why the Phoenix Suns are a really dangerous team at the end of the first quarter wow suns in the quarter on an 8-2 run they lead by 7 29 22 you know cuz you covered it with the Brooklyn Nets and we've seen him as he played with the Seattle Super Sonics way back in the day and he's been a mid-range incredible jump shooter his entire career he's always been in the top five in mid-range jump shots attempted on the season and when you look at the number of Seasons where he's had 50% plus shooting percentages from mid-range Michael there's only a handful of players every year that shoot 50% from mid-range and he's always one of them career 52.2 but look at how many seasons in a row this dude has been 50 plus from mid-range I mean and just an unbelievable scoring option so the three-point shooting is there the rim attacks are there but it's the ability to make shots at high level when they run you off the line you can't get to the rim wow Bradley Beal out of the timeout cutting action on Josh Minott right there just you know you think you got to have your head on a swivel and so that time you just cut out of that left corner and Minott had no idea we've talked about it that's one of the things Minott has to work on again so you know Bradley be fak he fakes like he's going to go hand it off and you know it's tough because you're you don't get into he's going to come out of the game right now cuz it's it's a matchup problem so you know he's defending a guy like Bradley Beal out of the corner and you're trying to get into his cut to take away the handoff you're trying to do your job and then because Bradley Beal's smart he understands that he's going to set the hook and then go back door on I me beautifully done that's tough and that's you know the Journey of an NBA player trying to make a name for yourself trying to get into the rotation might not just got 12 seconds here in this second quarter it's important ball game Dillingham over to R R Randle seeing a double team puts it up and through Julius Randle now three for five six points both teams with 16 paint points dun now it's Booker turn around Jay no good done the rebound sets up Booker for three 3524 largest lead of the game for the Suns in Minnesota playing tonight without Naz Reid Dillingham that's Kentucky on Kentucky crime Booker B finds Nick Richards and he's lonely yeah again screening action coming to the middle of the floor there's no low man help because the backside was activated that time and so no one thought to be low man Rudy's out there in coverage and you you got to help him out so tough play but well executed Again by Phoenix they're just getting Minnesota into actions that are tough to cover Randle got the bounce he now has eight Minnesota needs some stops Phoenix in a Groove offensively shooting 67% from the floor Richard saw the opening and is fouled by go M I just want to go back to the Minott situation again because this is something that Minnesota talks about all the time so when you're guarding somebody in the corner like that and you're Josh Minott you want to send the player up the floor you do not want to do what he does so he's trying to be an active Defender you see him like in a stance but the thing you can't do is jump into his cut like that you got to send it if he's below you you got to send him into the screen you don't not let him back cut so I'm sure it's one of those situations this is just FYI this is one of those situations where in practice in games this is multiple times situation where it it might happen so you know Fin's just got to this is a trying to lesson be learned right here so if you're a send them up the floor team you got to send them up the floor you can't let him go back door her you know what I mean so it's just a coaching point and there's going to be opportunities he may be frustrated right now but there's going to be more opportunities and he's too good a player he's he's an excellent excellent athlete he's a great kid and he's just right now but it really speaks to the pressure in a short amount of time that you have to take advantage of to get more minutes Randle in a Groove he's now in double figures with 10 remember he had 35 the last time these two teams got together Allen throwing it up to Nick Richards and he's a presence inside he has seven points three of four from the floor it's kind of been feast or famine with him he's had some really big games and he's had kind of games where he's only had seven or eight points in the game he's had a couple 20po games just had one against Washington and yeah he had a big game against Washington 20 points and 19 rebounds they call the foul on Devin Booker that's the first on Booker first team foul on the Suns uh Jim are you familiar with this name a snowplow contest yes I'm aware of it okay um Minnesota City Edition uniforms are bringing the winter Vibes and the team is taking their energy to men Do's name a snowplow contest I um grab your phone scan the QR code you see it right there on the bottom of your screen and vote for Rudy Gober Anthony sedwards uh just a few of the uh options that you can go with some of I have some other personal favorites on here um don't you SN don't you SN don't you SN did I that was Prett so proud of you I was I was doing game prep and I was also practicing in the hotel room just wanted to make you proud you made us all proud you know who's really proud right now Katie is at home Katie she's got the best see see she gave you a little bit of a leg up on that whole Minnesota accent thing that was well well tutored offensive foul going against Phoenix it's on Devin Booker he's asking Mike boser to to challenge it so Booker picking up a couple of quick fouls on both ends of the floor that's his second now 40-32 Randle he's been good in this second quarter that one is Off the Mark Royce O'neale the Grayson Allen Booker barking out instructions sets up O'neale O'neale I thought that was going to be an Al instead it was a little floater for the swish they just they pulling out all the stops here I mean they're trying to get Rob as as the low man that time to an empty side pick and roll forc low man into coverage right there Rudy had to come over they are just doing a lot of creative stuff here they left Dylan ham missed the shot knew it was off the Mark Allen the rebound Minnesota is shooting 52% from the floor but just 22% from three Allen lines it up missfires all the role players are excellent three-point Shooters too I mean think about Allen and gryce O'neale all these guys shoot 40% Randle left that one short and Gobert couldn't come up with the offensive Rebound Gobert with just one rebound so far as Booker smoked the layup but was fouled they're getting Dillingham with the foul and so Booker is going to shoot two Devin Booker 12 points on five of seven shooting oh that's that's a tough I I'm not trying to wh or anything challenge they're going to challenge it they're going to challenge it had the first that looked that looked like the definition of marginal Mikey Mike Mike Mike nor got the call from that time from Jeff Newton and and he just alerted VY hey let's challenge it good good that's good communication by the coaching there's no question there's contact the question is was it enough to affect the Shoto a defensive foul called this was marginal contact by Dillingham and Pat fryer reviewed it and deemed that it was that was not marginal contact excuse me not marginal contact it was enough to accelerate Devin Booker and warrant the foul the call on the floor stands and Booker is going to shoot too look I mean these players are really smart and they study the game they do film study they have their workout guys breaking down video for them and they're giving him all kinds of instructions and if you're a scorer like Devin Booker is one of the things that you know that if you're driving to the basket and if you feel a hand on your back no matter how hard they're pushing is you're going to sell it as a player so that was completely there was no acceleration by Rob Dillingham pushing on his back to accelerate him but Devin Booker is so smart these guys are so skilled that he feels a little hand on his back and that's all he needs to do to be able to act his way to the basket like that so it made it look like he was accelerated but he really wasn't Michael come on we agree on that right we do we do we do okay we do it's a it's a tough call to make um especially live but after reviewing it pat prayer felt like there was enough there to Warrant the foul so Booker is sixth to your point Booker is sixth in the NBA free throw attempts per game Conley out to Dillingham it rotates to Alexander Walker mid-range Jay yes Minnesota is perfect for mid-range that's their second one so they're two for two and Phoenix is four or five suns are coming off of a close victory over the Clippers in their last outing a game they were out scored 60 to 24 in the paint and one anyway Richard's no good on the hook you know every now I like seeing a little old school basketball big man backing down a big man going to a little hook Edwards for three long Minnesota's not been able to capitalize when Phoenix either misfired or turned it over and that's one thing Phoenix will do is give it up Richards blocked by go well anytime they go to Richards in inside in a post-up situation it's a victory for the Minnesota defense no no and Alexander Walker still working on his shot it's been a down month for him but overall a good shooting season Booker good Booker Edwards across the timeline so about mixing up the rotation and throwing different combinations out there we're going to see first half minutes for Jaylen Clark next dead ball Alexander Walker off the window does this make you feel good as I don't think that makes you feel great as a shooter I may need more Shooters to chime in on this but when you're trying to find your shot and then you bank it in I don't know if you feel great well you're relieved you're you're relieved I don't know if that was the intent there Durant good Minnesota can't have two undersized Defenders out there so Clark is going in because they're picking on whoever the low man is is dillian ham got the roll Jones oh O'neale brick rebound Edwards we want a dead ball I want to see McDaniels and Jaylen Clark check into the ball game Edward surrounded no all alone go now that feels good yes he had all the time in the world nobody was closing out to him and he shot it so smoothly Phoenix will call time out they lead by seven with 435 to go in this first half dilling Alexander Walker wolves on the Run Sun's Up 4942 and Jaylen Clark checking in out of this timeout his first first half minutes of his career now he was a former Defensive Player of the Year in his final year at UCLA of course missed all of last season with that Achilles injury known for his defense and now he's on the floor in the ball game with Kevin Durant out there Bradley Beal out there Devin Booker currently on the bench but excited to see the young fell get some early run gets a chance to guard tus Jones Beal hits Bradley nine points off the bench for Bradley Beal got to tell you just from afar why can't this work with Bradley Beal here in Phoenix with Kevin Durant Kevin Durant and Devin Booker I mean how can this not not work McDaniels no good in be the rebound I I understand you can only have too many so many two guards that score the basketball as much as Booker and Bradley Beal do but my goodness to have this kind of guy coming off the bench who cares how you do it if you're a starter coming off the bench he is an excellent player and it gives you extra Superstar depth oh step back Edwards good on a three snatched that back and hit the J it's a six-point ball game yeah there's so many story lines with his sons team the Jimmy Butler Saga and Miami Looney looming Bradley be had an incident with his wife in the St oh what a rejection by Edwards Alexander Walker hanging no but will shoot to Edwards with a huge rejection he's had enough this mess I mean so pick and Row game here and Anthony Edwards putting on the brakes and pulling it back to outside the arc and his shooting ability again Royce O'neale trying to bully ball Anthony an say no two free throws for Alexander Walker but going back to Bill his wife was in the stands look at the rejection Bill's wife was in the stands and someone was heckling saying get Bill out of here and bring in Jimmy and Bill's wife is there with their six-year-old son and they had to get the fan ejected I mean there's there's real tension here with this son's organization in terms of their Direction they have the highest payroll in the NBA at just over $222 million but I'm with you Jim Pete the success lately with be coming off the bench with their their opponents not withstanding I mean and you mentioned the Nick Richards thing and wanting to see that throw yeah the lead for Phoenix is four yeah the thing that you're thinking if if you're doing anything here at Phoenix maybe you try to move Jusuf Nurkic is another objection Clark the rebound pushes it up gives it over to Edwards Edwards for three got it pat frer says it's not a foul it's a onepoint ball game Plumlee and he's fouled by Anthony Edwards that's not a bet I mean that that's that should be the strategy is if if you get Mason Plumlee on a roll is just to put him on the free throw line put him on the line where he's a 62% foul shooter reverse JS Minnesota on an 18 to8 run right now Anthony has been just willing Minnesota back into this basketball game I mean Nickeil has been excellent Off the Bench so with nazri down you'd need someone to come and give you some production and Billingham is six and excuse me Nickeil has 10 and Plumlee just hit two free throws unbelievable he just had his Jaylen brown moment go yeah Euro puts it up no good and Plumlee caral it Booker over to Beal sets the feet can't hit the three McDaniels his fourth rebound of the ball game Edwards hard drive stops surrounded stripped McDaniels comes out of there with it still plenty of time on the shot clock Edwards gives it up but he's too late Durant easy flush Jaden needed a cut that time for Anthony an was under a lot of AR rest and Kevin Durant was just sitting there right in the passing Lane one pass away from Anthony just reading that situation they've been trying to coach Edwards on getting off of it quickly in those situations Edwards stripped from behind back to- back turnovers Sun's racing down the floor and it's tossed up wow saved by Booker and no one from Minnesota was able to get to it the ball went a mile in the air unreal a Magic Johnson Hook from Devin Booker just when you think the ball is going to Sail Out of Bounds Devin Booker does the incredible again another near turnover Edwards lost it out of bounds this is what I'm saying about Anthony Edwards being a decision maker against the pressure they're going to put on him you just knew it was going to happen they're Phoenix is going to try to make anybody else beat them besides that young man Anthony Edwards wolves went on a run to get to within one and since then it's been all Phoenix Edwards now with five turnovers and your point he's done everything to get Minnesota back into the ball game and now you've kind of had this last moment here here the end of the second quarter where they've misfired but Phoenix helps out by turning it over themselves me watch this save by D buer just throws it straight up in the air didn't have any idea where Grayson Allen was but right place right time and then he circled back out and got that drive to score on the possession with the sky hook foul is called on Royce O'neale first foul on O'neale first in the final two minutes on the Suns it'll be Edwards to work it in wolves have eight turnovers in this ball game the Suns with six first in the last minutes Alexander Walker Randle 12 points in the first half for Randle backing down O'neale tried to pull the chair in a crowd will they count it pum there's a discussion right now on whether or not this is on the the floor or whether they'll count the basket I feel like he pump faked and then he came down they C the basket they came down I didn't think he he was being fouled on the ground watch this I thought it was too fou yeah that's he's fouled on the ground kind of double clutch right there so it works in Minnesota's favor and one opportunity for Julius Randle fenix's biggest lead this half has been 12 and so for Minnesota to be in this situation right now with all the mistakes they they' made here keep in mind no Naas re tonight we've had early Jaylen Clark minutes Luka gar a minutes Chris VES had to go deep into the bench B for two be's really been really good out of the corner hasn't he that corner in front of the bench he's been spotted up there and it's done a lot of things shot it cut it dribbled it making it happen he's really handled his benching well they talked about his professionalism through all this Edwards will not get the lay in but earns a trip to the line first free throws of the ball game for Anthony Edwards He's been arguing for these shots since the opening tip he does have five three-point attempts in this game he's two of five but he's been attacking a lot woles fans memb ships are sold out this season but the Wolves weight list is your way in for just $100 per seat you'll get Priority Access the 20 25 26 seats before they're available to anyone else don't wait at the timberwolves.com weightless now 59 55 and off the shoe out of bounds Minnesota ball oh no they say it was off of McDaniel's shoe and bu hos is going to make a substitution there's 2.8 excuse me 2.3 on the second quarter game clock if credit to Jaylen Clark he's been able to remain out there on the floor defensively into Booker Booker Rises and The Shot W fall half time here footprint Center and we have a tight ball game suns have led by as many as 12 wolves go on a late second quarter run to get to within four 15 points for Julius Randle 14 for Anthony Edwards ball game we are joined Now by Wolves assistant coach Elon Turner and Coach the Suns led by as many as 12 in that first half what allowed you to get back into the ball game that you have to continue doing here in the second half well competing competing just don't stop man they have three very very very good scores that can create their own shots and they uh they play in waves I mean uh you know we want to just we them down and just keep the pressure on and competing and contesting uh every shot that they take looking forward to seeing this second half best of luck thank you so much coach thank you all right Jim Pete yeah I mean it's really on both ends the floor you know you think about how tight this game is and really Phoenix shot unbelievable from the floor from all areas and so Julius Randle and Anthony Edwards they did a great job of competing themselves and so both in double figures Julius with 14 excuse me 15 in the in the first half and Anthony Edwards has 14 himself and then contesting shots I mean this just talking to ston off air about this you know they are making shots but Minnesota has been in their space and has contested all these jumpers and then the bench battle for Minnesota you see M he's in double figure scoring he's got a a nice game going he's got 10 points and I I I like the fact that everybody kind of got involved Rob got involved Luka got involved in the first half as well and I just love the compete level of Anthony Edwards he is yeah W he made some mistakes and had a few turnovers Michael I I think that his the way that he's playing with energy and effort I just love the fact that he's competing out here Julius doing the same thing and as St said you just got to keep on them stay connect Ed keep contesting shots their offense could dry up and Minnesota needs to take advantage that's our Berard second half Scout third quarter underway tus Jones bringing it up the floor Suns by foran this is the second of four meetings between these two teams Durant and contact with McDaniels mad at himself is going to put Kevin Durant on the line well Durant missed the line share of the games that he's missed this year happened early and when Kevin Durant missed games again he just put the breaks on that that was a misjudge because McDaniels thought he was going to Lunge toward the basket for the Layin but faded instead and contact so Phoenix is in one of nine in the games that Durant hasn't played in this year so I mean that's tells you how important it is and and you know they're they're similarly when Devin Booker misses too and and you're thinking okay did they miss the games at the same time and no they really didn't I mean Booker missed different games than Durant missed it's just it's just unbelievable at that this Advanced age that Kevin Durant can still put in the basket as as regularly as he's 27 a game for Kevin Durant and you remember a time when an Achilles injury meant the end of your career oh yeah uh Isaiah Thomas for example to go back to the very early 90s had an Achilles injury and that was pretty much it for Isaiah Thomas meanwhile Kevin Durant has 5040 nearly 90 splits as Edwards gets another block nearly 50 4090 splits post Achilles te yeah still has explosiveness and can get separation another block for Anthony Edwards an two blocks in the first half and both of them were were pretty impressive it's his third there Booker tried to rifle pull a pass to the corner stolen by Randle and Edwards not really paying attention there as conly tried to get it to him think about the broken foot that Kevin Durant had too when he was in OKC so he's had multiple lower leg injuries that could derail your situation but thing about it though is he just loves the game wow clear screen action that time tus and tus can shoot it I mean so you look at the scotting report for this Phenix Suns team he talk about flush guys guys you have to get out there and really contest their shot it's more than just up to touch as Mike can't get that layup to go they've got five guys that are flush guys on their team Jones missed the layup he SM that he surprised himself at how open he was that's knocked out of bounds by the Suns I don't get why players think they need to serve it up on a platter I mean like they don't put their other hand on the basketball there there's I just never really like I never really learned that technique and I you see a lot of guys doing it right there they didn't you know they don't put their other hand on the ball to balance the basketball they just serve it up on a platter and go to the rim Edwards three more Anthony Edwards his third triple of the ball game he has 192 on the season and the Suns turn it over their eighth turnover of the ball game Richards runs over Mike Conley it's funny Mike buos reacts to these things so much it's funny to watch him play sometime or coach sometime on his Sidelines cuz like he gets a look on his face like his house is burning him I mean it's like it's he just it's this this look on his is so funny go here's Booker got the lay in 6658 Edwards around to Gobert finds a cutting Randle for the flush beautiful job by Julius to cut Jones using the hesi the floater left it short Randle the rebound wolves on the run Conley now will slow things down gets a pick from Gobert fires from deep and delivers first field goal of the night for Mike Conley and it makes it a onep possession ball game Ty Jones just one of four he's got three points in the game and Mike Conley matches him now three minutes G by here in the third Booker on the logo trying to get by Edwards takes the bump tosses it out to Jones Jones the runner is good he's shooting 53% from the floor and 46% from deep in his last four ball games bu hoser has talked openly about wanting him to be more aggressive speaking of aggressive Kevin Durant the block on Gobert and the star down Durant to the rim missed the reverse McDaniels took a shot to the groin Randle and the foul is called foul is on the floor and this is what you were talking about Jim Pete I think that's kind of a regular face he's he gets has this stress he's got he's got very distinctive uh yeah he stress look quite it's the default face he's he's but he's a great coach and you know just tremendous you know career in coaching with the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant with pop and what he did in Atlanta transforming that franchise he not only transformed that franchise as McDaniels hits a corner three to tie this ball excuse me to Bull the Wolves to within two yeah but McDaniels now up to eight points um but buto also changed the game getting bigs getting bigs to shoot threes for sure I mean yeah there's no doubt about it Paul Milsap and what he did with Paul Milsap to make him into a three-point shooter that was just a Alor for two I mean just absolutely changed the game really can't Corell that one a little bit off Target hard to catch and the turnover starting to pile up Edwards with six turnovers now 6866 this is not this has not been one of those Rudy's had some good moments in this game but statistically when you look at the stat line two points three rebounds he's done more than that Durant the step throw in the leg Durant 70-66 forcing the switch and they're getting a foul on the floor tus Jones had a handful of Jersey and this is the first time that Anthony Edwards and Kevin Durant have competed against each other this season since winning gold together in the Summer Olympics get Kevin Durant did not play in that first meeting back in Minnesota and so much conversation about how those two H it off I mean aun was like little brother following Big Brother well you know it's it's another one I've been talking about Chris hein's book and one of the things that's in that book is is how much Anthony Edwards Love video games what a pass that nice pass that one on the money but I love that because Anthony had the he dropped the last one and Anthony went right back to him right there driving off that screen and then rolling to the rim Rudy it's it's trust factor and a trusting him again it's very important love that camaraderie an is just a great teammate another look at it special delivery to 27 Kevin Durant slim Reaper he has 18 points Randle has 17 for the Wolves as does Anthony Edwards are chipotle real differen makers so far in this ball game the stars are stepping up and scoring and playing well it's yeah we covered it in our show open about the importance of these four guys also talked about the importance of Rudy Gobert and Nick Richards in this game and Rudy just got the the dunk off the pass and has four assists in the game and I was alluding to the video games that Anthony Edwards used to play when he was a kid and he would play with Kevin Durant was his guy when he played NBA 2K so imagine that you're a kid play you grow up and your Kevin Durant is your guy your hero and all of a sudden you're playing against him and and you're competing against him and beating him it's it's it's one of the it's playoff it's one of the most incredible experiences Michael I can't tell you what it was like for me to play against K ABD jaar Dr J when I first got in the leag it was just a complete mind Bender it's it's hard to it's hard to describe it as J McDaniel going at one of his Heroes too I'm sure when he sees Kevin Durant he thinks about his own game because I'm sure he was compared to him on some level talk about slim I mean they both have the same body type and what a what a thrill and Jaden McDaniels is playing some of the best basketball he's played in his career so this is going to be a challenge for mikee buen hoser feels like there was an elbow this is what the officials are looking at elbow to face contact from McDaniels to Bradley Beal and the only question is if they're going to overturn this call and make it an offensive fou well do you remember the the play in New Orleans and you and I have referenced this play oh my God several times when Zion Williamson attacked the basket in a fast break situation and hit Rudy Gobert in the chin and knocked Rudy down and KN need to have that clip in the rotation we ref we need to have our yeah I might even have that in his in his memory bank down there in his video file but but it was called a basketball move and exactly a basketball move and they and and Zion Williamson clocks Rudy Gobert in the chin what they call it unfortunate unfortunate contest unfortunate yeah but it was they called it unfortunate contact because he was making a basketball play um in the air going at The Rim but he absolutely wrecked Rudy Gobert so another look at it we're going to get an explanation P from Pat fa so it's either an offensive foul or a call will stand and it's an N1 opportunity for McDaniels we have 62 to go in a two-point ball game p review Beal is retreating as McDaniels leads with his elbow to to the face therefore this is going to be overturned to an offensive foul the challenge is successful penix is charg with a timeout well okay so it's hard to argue with that one hard to argue with that one so offensive foul second foul called on Jayden McDaniels and my thing is is I I wanted I mean I I would want that call if I'm Bradley Bal and if I'm the Phoenix Suns and I would want that call and and we wanted that call for Rudy Gobert bear in New Orleans that night two years ago when Zion Williamson clocked Rudy in the jaw too so they have adjusted the scoreboard and turnover Edwards the other way the dell and the Finish 72- 70 Durant getting by Rand missed the layup Bo Minnesota's really dodged some bullets in this game I mean they've smoked sure layups at least four times in this game three-pointer off the heel from Alexander Walker Booker no good easily got the offensive Rebound in the corner Bradley Beal for three no rebound McDaniels McDaniels has 11 games this season where he has eight rebounds yes eight of them have come this month right it's unbelievable look at his game log at how many times he's had eight rebounds over his career I mean he might be around 20 for his entire career and again eight this month and Alexander Walker called for the travel every time the wolves get right on the cusp yes of getting over the hump they shoot themselves in the foot and then Phoenix goes on a run it's a two-point ball game 507 to go in the third and our guy Jaylen Clark Jaylen clark getting second half minutes rewarded for his play in the first half they're having a discussion about the points the score is correct it was 72-70 when they counted the bucket by McDaniels when the call was overturned they changed it to 72 to 68 right and then Edwards got a layup on a turnover and so it is 72 to 70 Pat fryer just wanted to make sure and all of the guys at the scores table was on the hot seat they felt it I mean we're right in the we're right we're right in the eyesight line when benen hoser was talking to these guys and we're right Chris Finch has been ejected from the ball game CJ Washington and heard enough well we looked up how many technical fouls P spinch has in his career one is Bradley Beal just taunting him right now he's just egging him on wow well we know one thing for sure is that when finy went down here in Phoenix Grays Allen returns with Theon wow and Edwards we we know one thing for sure is that Mike Nory can take over and run the show he is an excellent coach and he did an unbelievable job last year in that Denver series he did getting Minnesota to the you know the Western Conference Finals Durant over to Beal toss out O'neale extra pass Booker lost the handle momentarily caught in the air finds O'neale shot clock winding down good defense and wolves did not have possession so they stopped the fast break opportunity again it was tapped Away by Alexander Walker he's right but he didn't Corral it so it's a shot clock violation and no possession Nila hadn't quite tracked it down yet right call Randle with the rock backing down Beal steps inside he's fouled it's going to be three team fouls on the Phoenix Suns with 427 to go in the third here's another look at Chris Finch and CJ Washington what possibly could have been said here okay for all you uh fluent and lip rating there's McDaniels knocks down the J to tie it up at 72 can tell Chris fence that I'm saying I was I was saying it the be and then he said one more thing under his breath and uh first career ejection for Chris first career ejection under four minutes to go in the third Minnesota has put so much pressure on Phoenix if Edwards block that one that is his fourth of the ball game and that's a career high great rejection in the corner Jaylen Clark no and it's out of bounds Phoenix ball Minnesota has put some pressure on Phoenix tonight and and I think they it's also an impact of Phoenix's ability they've missed some of these shots because Minnesota has been all over them Durant the fade nicely done Kevin Durant 22 two both teams shooting 54% in this Edwards for three no good nearly tipped up and in by Randle lost the handle on the offensive rebound O'neale trying to get ahead of the pack and nearly had it stolen from him by Nickeil Alexander Walker who's now with the fans Ryan returns to the sun line replacing deer and there's been a lot of yapping in this ball game you know Rivals week was a week ago but these two teams certainly could have played during Rivals week absolutely Durant 22 points on the night out to Grayson Allen back to Kevin Durant stolen by McDaniels seat belt making the play up to Alexander Skywalker for two just love it again Minnesota pressed up putting the pressure on yes Phoenix has made shots yes Kevin Durant Devin Booker and Bradley be have all made shots but there's been someone on these guys all night long Beal whips it over to Dun and it's one and dun for the Suns wolves an opportunity to take the lead Edwards Blow by revers Le count it and put him on the line Edwards entered this ball game tied with Karl Anthony-towns and Giannis an TMO for most completed and ones in the NBA this season we talked about this in the first half the compete level for Minnesota's been here from the beginning Chris Finch had read these guys the right act after not coming with their full play and how about Jaylen Clark keeping it alive here he gets elbowed in the face by Kevin Durant right there they're going to call a foul on Clark I think that Pat FR is waiting for him to get up so we can see his number what happens Jaylen Clark was six years old when Kevin Durant was drafted into the NBA and now he's battling for him on rebounds and getting hit in the face 76 74 and another bad pass and McDaniels could have let that go out of bounds denen McDaniels now he's in double figures with 10 points he felt he crl he wanted to get the steal Durant into Beal small line up on the floor for both teams sort of matching up with Durant with Jaden about Clark forcing be to give it up done with an airball and it's Minnesota ball Jaylen Clark first real true minutes in his NBA career making an impact on the defensive end R O'neale was Utah's best defender in the Utah Heyday Randle fouled and will shoot two you think about those great Utah Jazz teams with Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell Mike Conley at the point guard Royce O'neale and really Royce O'neale is is great great story because you know Baylor guy played it New Orleans in fact finy had him in New Orleans as well and then he ends up making it with the Utah Jazz and becomes you know he was the one a Defender they had along with UD Gobert you use the one guy that could guarden the perimeter and also guarden the post as well let's get a word from Honda so brus O'neale's down Mason Plumlee comes into the game to replace him hooker back in as well Randle splits a pair the suns in the last 6 minutes of action two for eight from the floor and five turnovers Minnesota's had a lot to do with that good ball movement here Grayson Allen for three Julius tried to rotate just a little bit late but all tied up Edwards left alone left it short and Durant clears it for the Suns 75 seconds to go in this third quarter it's been a terrific ball game front end of a backto back for Minnesota Booker Allen with the pump fake sets up Durant for three no tipped up and off by dun long rebound it finds Booker Booker penetrating done blocked at The Rim it's a backa wolves Clark swatted by Durant what a sequence both ways sure was I like that a gave it up would like to have seen Jaylen Clark knock that down but just a great defensive play by Kevin Durant what a block by Jaden McDaniels and Off to the Races Minnesota is the throw ahead if you're Jaylen Clark just you know in the future get into the body of Durant that time and draw the foul cuz you know he's going to go after that layup you lay that thing up he's going to swap that thing away then you also shoot with you shoot it with your right hand too and so I don't know I'm trying to draw contact in that situation you would have tried to dunk it on Durant I probably would have tried to dunk it dunk it on him uh Durant has long been underrated true his abilities on the defensive side of the ball he's an offensive Savant one of the best offensive players this game has ever seen was still underrated on the defensive end wolves fans this season statement auction is happening during wolves Wizards on Saturday February 1st bid on signed game War jerseys including gear warn by Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels plus mystery boxes with autographed items don't miss out visit timberwolves.com auction for more BS shooting 50 50% from the floor here in this third quarter wolves have turned it over four times the Suns six times here in the period and we have a tie ball game this has been an outstanding game tonight second meeting of the season now we need to bring the defense six blocks from Minnesota the game they average just under five Edwards gives it up Alexander Walker no good Clark two points thisle play first field goal of his career's first NBA points came on free throws and Clark they had a Difference Maker here tonight Plumlee it's in the hands of Booker Booker had a hot start to this ball game has gone cold since three balls short long rebound Allen back to Booker Clark has the assignment Booker tried to dump it off stolen Edwards full head of steam it won't drop but Edwards is going to shoot too and what a flurry by the Wolves to close this third quarter I've been just super impressed with Clark's defense the fact that he got the put back on the other end is one thing that makes him feel good about being out there contributing on the offensive scorecard but the way that he's been all over Devin Booker an has been just fantastic all night Edwards now with 22 points it's his 39th 20-point game of the season he has in the Comfort Zone on the road he's averaging 28 points on the road this season about 24 at home a some day one we should set up we at that sh of the fan in the stands there are so many timber wolves fans in this building yeah there's a lot of lot of people from Minnesota that that spend their winter months snowbirds that's right you there's a bunch of them those guys are super represented right there they are um those shades are extremely dark by the way I know can that guy even see the court seems counterproductive I wear like that 2.5 Booker gives it to O'neale beat the clock off the mark thir how about the Wolves a strong third quarter are outscoring the Suns 25- 18 and they lead by four as we go to the fourth our Royal Caribbean Starwatch his 23rd consecutive game scoring 20 points you look at this list guys 36 or older consecutive 20 point games of course you have LeBron James there high on the list Captain Kevin Durant Jabar 22 by the way 23 straight games with 20 points is the third longest streak in Phoenix Suns history wolves are entering the fourth quarter with a four-point Advantage the Suns scored 29 Points in the first quarter they scored 30 points in the second quarter held to 18 in the third two of FO five shooting in the first quarter from outside the arc just four of 16 C to six makes so far for a team on the season average 14 a game I 14 is 10th in the NBA pass telegraphed easily stolen by Royce O'neale wolves out there with Dylan ham Mike Conley Julius Randle Nickeil Alexander Walker and Rudy Gobert Randle looking for an opening flips it up and in Julius Randle looking like Julius Irving on that play Just swooping to the hole that time flips that one in off the glass and that was that was really well done Allen set up beautifully left the three short Dillingham getting up for the rebound both teams on a three-game winning streak Randle hard drive he's fouled on attack these broken floor situations with Julius handling the basketball have had some mixed results so Rudy setting the screen here and that's the layup from two possessions ago that was that's juli's little finger roll little George Gervin action like the English on that with the right hand how about that and he's in a nice little hot stretch speaking of Julius Randle He had a l there for a while and now he's enjoying back to back to back 20 Point performances for the first time since late November three straight games scoring 20 points that's a good question what's that kind ask you a question yeah can if Julius Rando can swoop to the hoop like that with the right-handed flip shot looking like Connie Hawkins here in Phoenix why doesn't he do it more often he doesn't use his right hand as often as he could I I just think that that was just he looked just so effortless doing it more of that never want to let him know you move shot clock winding down on Devin Booker and he threw it behind tus Jones again turnovers even with having a pure point guard in tus Jones turnovers still an issue for the Phoenix Suns wolves have not completely been able to capitalize off of those turnovers tonight right Conley out to Alexander Walker Randle flips the wrist left it short Conley the hustle and knocked out of bounds by Devin Booker that was reminiscent of the play that led to coach Finch yeah in that need this same two players Devin Booker kind of forcing Mike Conley out of bounds that time and Mike kind of chain reaction falling into Finch's legs and watch Mike on the Baseline right there track this thing down look to tripping him up Rand on an island with Plumlee over to Alexander Walker three ball corner pocket right in front of an ecstatic bench second dime of the game for Julius Randle but that was timely largest lead of the night for the Wolves Plumlee again you can understand Minnesota upset right now Plumlee got away with the same push in the back that led to a Gobert foul in the first ATT Julius putting the ball on the floor with his left hand and without putting his other on the hand just getting it out there to the corner to theel and again Mike Conley gets pushed in the back that time by Plumlee and no call but again smart play by Mike to wrap him up just roll okay he's a step Curry of free throws right now he's over for two from the field but he's perfect from the free throw line there's a Miss knocked out of bounds it's going to be Minnesota basketball Plumlee has been good at the line tonight three for four it's 88 to 80 there's the look from but look concerned always concerned to's had a great career though hasn't he I mean Duke University he's rooting go be couldn't hammer it home Allen over to Jones and they left Allen open Allen is not afraid of the moment it's an excellent three three-point shooter Randle Randle turns inside whips it over to Dillingham Dillingham oh he finessed it home 9083 Booker and now it's Allen shadowed by Dillingham Allen on the drive finds Jones can't hit hustle for the ball Dillingham comes out of there with it behind the back Alexander Walker cash no Naz Reid no problem for Nickeil he's got 18 in the game six of 10 for n four of eight from outside the AR and go back to Monday night did you think that nil Alexander Walker would play tonight the way he was helped off the floor that's a great point we left the arena being very concerned about the Kil concerned the leg is fine Dillingham with the floater and then behind the back no yes talking about locked in I also wanted to see his face after he made that floater over the top along the Baseline that was well done too desperation time for the Suns Durant bucket and the foul and we have an eternity to go in this ball game Durant forced to check back in as the Wolves lead balloon to 10 and after Durant hit the shot it's Jaden McDaniels and Anthony Edwards checking back in for the Wolves as Dillingham and Mike Conley will take a seat you've been talking about the intensity all night Jim P this is yeah this has been a really good competitive back and forth ball game I mean the fact that Minnesota has been able to drive down Phoenix's field goal percentage and and they've really come here in second half and as much as they were competing in the first half they were just making shots that were contested and so wolves just kept it up it's been unbelievable Alexander Walker again ke's on his zone right now I mean it's exactly what Minnesota needed they needed a big Julius Randle game and they've gotten that and they needed n to be excellent Off the Bench five three-pointers for Nickeil Alexander Walker 21 Durant can't answer rebound Edwards wolves enjoying their largest lead Edwards blocked by Durant Allen full head of steam slows it up Booker in the corner to O'neale brick you said it 21 points for Nickeil Alexander Walker Randle Lefty floater it drops it's a really quiet Phoenix crowd here right now they were really into the game Randle the steel finds Edwards lightning has struck the lead is 14 and's been on another level all night long he is come to Phoenix to play we're going to call F on and here got a little rambunctious with Devin Booker a little push he's he's hot feels very disrespect in this game he has not gotten a lot of calls been a lot of physical contact with him and Julius Randle love the passion I mean the compete level in this ball game has been off the charts Minnesota on a 123 run Durant open good ball screen excuse me good off ball screen to set up Durant for the easy J got discarded that time 100-88 wolves have thrown a lot of punches tonight they have to keep throwing them Alexander Walker short McDaniels the board Edwards midrange off window no Alexander Walker got it and put it in it's like there's six white jerseys on the floor bill being hounded by Randle Bal off balance no offensive rebound Booker has it on the logo Booker finds a cutting Richards Richards puts it up and it comes out again they're getting the ball out of the primary ball Handler's hand hands making them make decisions in Pocket pass decision- making with their pigs and all the shots that were falling in the first half aren't going here Richards is going to be called for a foul on the Rudy roll so think about all those shots that went down Michael in the first half again Nickeil getting in there crashing from the corner getting paid 535 to go in this fourth quarter Minnesota looking for their fourth win in a row which would match a season High Conley got it into Gobert Edwards between the leg dribble around a Gobert strain Rises and hits 27 for Anthony Edwards yeah they Rudy been hurting him with the roll so now they're playing drop an coming off that Rudy screen he's free to shoot it Durant finds Beal over to Allen pump Drive Beal Booker in the corner no good Richard's the offensive board out to Beal Allen all alone got a three every time they've left Grayson Allen open he's made Minnesota pay it's been the one guy here in the second half that's been able to make a shot he has nine points in this ball game hand off to Edwards and Gobert called for an offensive foul kind of a cell job right there offensive foul number 27 Ry call that Jaden was see go over Pat FR and can I get that call again so screening action here Rudy with the hand off and that's just a Devin Booker soell job right there falling down 14th turn over the ball game pickpocket Edwards the runway is clear for Ant-Man an given the Primal scream that time and Kevin Durant with a smile just like he saw last year at Target Center in the playoffs again this is going to just deserts right here Minnesota after the Rudy Gobert screen on Devin Booker gets paid right there with the mishandling by Grayson Allen Edwards has been dunking so violently the ball has been ricocheting near Center Court had to go get the ball b for three made it m Nori wants to call timeout here 406 to go on regulation lot of basketball to be played Minnesota on top casino story of the game Michael where would we be without nil Alexander Walker and nil's had some up and down games shooting the basketball but as you said earlier this year he's on season he's had a tremendous shooting season but this is exactly what they needed from him in this game tonight and after a game where you at the end of game situation last ball game for Minnesota against Atlanta theel went down at the end looked like an ankle injury or a foot injury of some sort we didn't know and leaving the arena we were worried about whether he was going to be able to play or not yes and so Nickeil has this game after not being sure he was going to play did not see him on the injury report I was just it was it made us both happy we were both we were both excited about that and for him to come out here and have this game just shows you toughness and and how important he is to this team Edward splits the defense and draws a trip to the Line This is why you keep chopping way and you keep pounding the rock you know and Minnesota was not getting paid off for all the hard work that they were putting in against this Phoenix team in the first half Phoenix was hit making shots but they just kept on chipping away and and keeping it close and then here in the second half their defense has been tremendous they' put pressure on Phoenix they've gotten Steals and and turns it into into points and transition and anthon Julius just led the way with Nickeil let's get a word from TSR injury law from Minnesota it's DSR time for a higher level of representation Call 612 TSR time wolves short-handed tonight no NZ R and how about this Jaylen Clark has checked in he's earned it he's been close this ball game he's been a done a nice job on Devin Booker been able to stay in front of him without help Edwards all over Beal here is that match up Clark and Booker switch Booker working on Alexander Walker good defense go and the wolves are going to call timeout with 327 to go in this fourth quarter Mike an nor doing something brilliant right there playing offense defense he's platooning Jaylen Clark and getting him out of the game now but they calls the timeout to be able to make the switch offensively so you you love this you know you put in Jaylen Clark to get a stop they get a switch there with Nickeil Rudy comes and seals off the Lane Minnesota calls the timeout here so just another brilliant defensive possession here the fact that you've got all these Defenders that you know this is what we've been kind of hoping for you know ever since they drafted Jaylen Clark and Tim Connelly what they liked about him was his ability to play defense Elite level Defender we couldn't see it right away because of his injury but Michael this is what we hope for Jaylen Clark to come along and to be able to help a team just let the game just like this when you have all these Dynamic scorers on the floor Jaylen Clark has com into the game now and has had an impact you think about that game against Denver last season in the postseason when the Kil Alexander Walker and McDaniels were hounding Jamal Murray uh in and what was one of the more brilliant defensive performance in a playoff game that you'll ever see and all the while a former college defensive player of the year is just look at his chops would love to be a part of the action and he's getting his opportunity tonight against the likes of Devin Booker Bradley Beal and Kevin Durant and the young fell is at an impact I mean if we get a chance to see the standings I mean you'll see how important this game is this is an important game because Phoenix is right there with Minnesota in the standings they're just like that that one game difference so this is important to to be able to get a two nothing advantage in the season series huge again you're talking about his Suns team that's a half game behind Minnesota right now right for those who joined us late Chris Finch was ejected in the third quarter the Wolves were down by two points at that time they've outscored the Suns 3822 since Baseline Drive McDaniels is fouled and the suns are in the penalty how about that a 38-22 run since Chris fch was ejected yeah and let me tell you something Chris Finch was on fire from the very start of this game and look at what this game means to Minnesota you know they they have the playoff now they have their season series advantage over the Mavericks they've got a two nothing Advantage if they do win this game here in Phoenix it's not over yet obviously but I'm just saying these are all important for playoff positioning for tiebreakers got an advantage over the Clippers as well this is why you have all these smart guys over there on the bench you know and Micah getting the Reps this is uh this is really well done these guys put put in such hard work 12 points six rebounds for McDaniels Bradley Beal draws a foul and we'll go to the free throw line Bradley Beal 14 points Off the Bench I didn't think it was going to be possible I thought it was going to be tough for Minnesota to beat this no question Phoenix bench and bench scoring in this game I mean they're 22nd in the in the league in bench going so it's not like they're a juggernaut but I mean in fact Minnesota averages more points per game Off the Bench but NZ re is such a huge part of that equation to not have him in the game and to not have Dante again going back to Monday the Wolves bench was outscored 55-25 against an at Atlanta team right part of the reason why Chris Finch went off on them by the way so outscored 5525 Bradley Bal missing and are they going to say it was the foul is on the floor they're waving off the basket the foul is on Jaden McDaniels that's going to be his fourth nevertheless Minnesota in the penalty Jaden just get Lock's arms Bradley Beal therey I'm sorry Edwards and CJ Washington have a big argument discussion about the foul I think the the rim miks are picking everything up you may not have realized that the suns were in the penalty foul was on the floor but it is five fouls on the Wolves Bill knocks down both free throws it's 110 to 97 three minutes to go Randle backing down O'neale out to Conley Conley stops gives it up to Alexander Walker Randle has it back with a shot clock down to to Three Fires from Deep left it short late whistle it's a foul going against Grayson Allen three free throws coming for Julius random and the Wolves once again sucking the air at a footprint Center and the suns are going to challenge well you don't really have a choice of your Mike I mean you might as well looks like it was kind of marginal I couldn't really see if there was a slap Grayson Allen got to the side of Julius rangle so there's nothing to do with him coming into contact with the feet getting underne towards the defensive foul Phoenix is called timeout to challenge the play oh he hit the elbow oh yeah so Pat fryer and then will'll look at this again the sun's had a successful challenge earlier in the ball game this will be their last one we mentioned earlier so many story lines with this Phoenix Sun Squad there's Jusuf nurkic right there he's making $18 million this season he is out of the rotation for Mike buenos he has not played in the last 10 games heading into this ball game he's obviously not played tonight and he talked about how he's going to be a pro about this whole thing but he's completely frustrated about the fact that he just can't get run right now and is fallen out of favor and he was asked by a media member whether or not he and Mike Bosa could sit down and talk this over and worked this out and he said no comment now if you're asking me between Jusuf nurkic and Mason Plumlee and Nick Richards P review Allen makes contact with the elbow of Randle therefore this stands as the defensive foul the challenge is unsuccessful play will resume three free throws who would you put the I mean like Nurkic is an incredibly talented player but there's got to be something behind more than just playing on the floor Nick Richards has got utility I'm not saying he doesn't Bon plomley doeses too obviously but but but all between the three of them Jusuf nurkic is the most talented player absolutely on paper he his numbers are down significantly this season he did not have a good start to the season um but even nurkic not playing his best basketball you got to think that he could still give you something out there how about the second half shooting Kevin Durant six of eight in the first half Booker seven of 10 in the first half five of seven for Bradley Field second half for Durant for Durant five of nine one for five for Booker and one for three for Bradley P I'm look I I know look I know that I know that Jaylen Clark wasn't guarding Durant much he he had his stance against Booker and he had his stance against be but Jaylen Clark deserves the game ball tonight I'm sure Chris Finch is going to mention one Jaylen Clark as he should as he should 112 to 97 Booker long range Money 12-point Ball game still a lot of time left too there is we'll just need to take care of the and stay in attack mode skip pass Randle OH beautiful Spin and a beautiful Lane such Patience by Anthony Edwards that time in that possession he was being trapped he kept his head about him and just waited O'neale gives it up and is kicked out of bounds 14 on the shot clock for the Suns 2011 to go in regulation again ants being bracketed right there and Jaden was was actually open cutting right in front of him but Bryce O'neale had left Julius Randle wide open an just waited to pick the defensive par that's just great pie and intelligence bucket in the foul for Devin Booker Devin Booker gets the foul call here in the end one opportunity and Anthony Edwards can't believe it it's a good call absolutely got to have your head on the swiel and you can't let go of the Rope right now you got to have attention to detail that's you can't have defensive lapses like that to play minutes Edwards with a ridiculous deadline tonight more on that in a moment Conley for three Cash slamming the door shut on the Suns Booker gives it up Durant Corner three he got it Mike Conley winning the B oh there's oh that's that's a clean Steel 117 108 Alexander Walker down the lane floats it up won't go 75 seconds remaining Suns looking for a heartbeat Durant alone three more K could have just dribbl that out R O'neale is going to get called for foul here pressing up on Anthony Edwards I mean this is a kick ball right here I mean how is that not a kick ball how do you miss that call I mean that is just in the middle of the floor for everybody to see unreal Grayson alen's trying to say he got his hand down there to get the reflection but that's that's ridiculous he literally was saying I got my hand down there and got the deflection but then then players do do that to be able to fool the referee they kick their foot out but they stick their hand down there by their foot and they try to make it seem like they get a deflection Mike Conley's over there talking to Kevin Cutler and Kevin Cutler just got his hands up in the air Anthony Edwards 33 points seven boards five assists career high four blocks Bradley Beal working on Randle lot of dribbling leaves it for Booker who scores Edwards also has two steals his entire stat line something we've only seen from Kevin Garnett and McDaniels is fouled and will go to the line Kevin Garnett and Karl Anthony-towns only other wolves players to match the stat line from Anthony Edwards tonight I think it's going to be interesting to see who the Western con Conference reserves are and it's going to be intered to see who gets it um you know well that man he's going to be one that man going to be one Booker will be Devin Booker will be interesting he'll be he'll be in the conversation Norm power I think you know it's it might come down to someone like Norman pow and and Devin Booker Norman pow deserves to be an All-Star Michael GRE say Folks at home can't see jimy turned around he fully facing me trying to get a reaction out I know I you know what I'm not going I'm not going I'm not going to I am I am Booker missed the layup Randle the rebound and now the Wolves firmly in the driver's seat Alexander Walker and is Tapped Out of Bounds and it'll be wolves ball 7sec differential between the shot clock and game clock Alexander Walker has been brilliant Off the Bench tonight time outa and the wolves are going to call one more time out oh McDaniels so Neil with the finger right towards Devin Booker now we'll see what the what the call is going to be here same face all the time from Jada McDaniels and Booker going out with 28 points eight assist and an L this altercation that doesn't dissolve is under review here's another look at it video right in the middle of your screen McDaniel's talking to Royce O'neale and then now it's directed towards Devin Booker and I don't know what the finger to the temple is going to lead to perhaps a technical foul another look at it I think he didn't obviously like what Devin Booker had to say and J Daniels is probably going to be ejected from this game for putting his hands on him can't do that can't put your hands on somebody and somewhere in all this Kevin Durant also picked up a technical I did not see what Kevin Durant did but McDaniels is also going to face some disciplinary action here after this review Pat fryer talking it over right now with Kevin Cutler this should have been a Rivals week game JP I'm telling you here's P FR P review we have a double technical foul on Booker and McDaniels but McDaniels is ejected for the finger to the face the Double T is for a double verbal altercation D is's ejected finger to the F again there's still no explanation there may be an error on the scoreboard but they have it down as a technical foul for Kevin Durant uh but that might be an error on the scoreboard so double technicals and an ejection for Jen McDaniels and how about this ball game this this game has had everything J P great action great shot making a Chris Finch ejection finchy getting fired up finchy was fired up baby it was fun to watch some spectacular Edwards dunks Mike anori finishing the ball game and it's going to be a fourth win in a row for the Minnesota Timberwolves after fch five games over 500 and five games over 500 a season high after fch challenged them and chewed them out after Monday's win over Atlanta they take the violation 7 seconds remaining Richards is going to get it into Gillespie and that'll do it the snowbird Minnesota Timberwolves fans in the building saw a good one tonight you saw a good one at home Minnesota with a 121 113 Victory to improve the 26 and 21 on the season 33 points for Anthony Edwards his 14th 30-point game of the season 28 for Julius Randle and 23 for Nickeil Alexander Walker there's Monte Morris played with the Wolves a season too we got the green wolves Jersey there Randle of big Knight again 28 points seven boards six assists the Wolves were brilliant in the second half of this ball game no doubt Wolves win by eight joining us right now Nickeil Alexander Walker and Nickeil just take us through the last 48 hours because seeing you walk off the court gingerly with the help of your teammates had everybody worried how did you get yourself ready for this ball game for me it's just W to play as many games as I can the journey that I've been through and first and foremost it just got hit in the nerve and everything uh was scary at first but good to go now but everything I just been through within my career playing not playing any opportunity I have to play I Don't Want to Miss that and so for me it was everything I could do treatment early mornings twice just to be able to play and have this opportunity this was a sensational performance particularly in the second half on the defensive end what did it take to dig deep and win this ball game I think it just took te toughness I think when we got to the end of the first half we had built some momentum we fought we chipped our way back in and we found the Rhythm we knew what was going to help us and Propel us man down you know missing Naz and Naz has been a huge help but everybody just stepped up and we did what we had to do defended and got stopped nil I think it was important obviously your scoring was much needed but I I was really proud of Jaylen Clark to come into the game and do what he did defensively to be able to defend Devin Booker and be so versatile out there and to get a stint in the first half and second half you guys have to be really proud of him for sure that's my that's like my little brother his process with his whole Achilles coming back on a two-way working his way into just having a chance to play and being ready for that chance I think he he stepped up every every night on the road we just been talking he's been watching the games he he's intent with everything he does and so I'm happy for the performance he had tonight five three-pointers from you how good did it feel to find that rhythm again man James White James White is kept telling me man positive energy positive energ just trust it trust the work take too many shots to worry about it and I had to trust that just getting back to allowing the game to come and trusting in God as well well we'll leave you with this how about fi getting ejected getting fired up you guys responded well yeah everybody just had to have some fight that's all took just some fight some step up on the road back to back ahead you know just just dig deep we'll see you in Salt Lake City thank you so much Alexander Walker thank you Nickeil with 23 points in this ball game and this one was a highlight Factory 33 from Anthony Edwards wolves live post game next
