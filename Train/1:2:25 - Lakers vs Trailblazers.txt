 very good Cleveland team we were most impressed with them they beat the Lakers in post efforts this season first uh right LeBron he hesitated when he came off the screen enough time to clear the lane and easy hoop you would have thought that was LeBron to AB the way they executed that right off the tip like they usually try to do Shaedon Sharpe Deni Avdija he can shoot under and Hayes is there defensively to reject it's going to beAvdijaagain this one's a wide open mid-range shot tapped by Rui and taken by LeBron I'm the head Jaxon Hayes in a bad defensive positioning but he didn't get the contact that he wanted now Camara has the chore of trying to Mark LeBron this time down the floor and Ayton has control of it Avdija now into the front court for Portland they have a record of 11 and 21 currently 13th in the Western Conference five full back of the 10th spot and Sharpe hits the three I mentioned that he's had some real nice moments against the Lakers some highlight plays and some good overall games yeah in the first meeting he led them with 19 points that was a game here look at they are the crowd but he couldn't finish it well he put a move on that just as you mentioned didn't finish it that three goes in and out this is not a good three-point shooting team they have the third worst percentage in the NBA ch good offensive rebound doing some work as Rui and he'll get two free throws good work on the glass field goal percentage and for Chanty in his fourth season as the Blazers head coach one of the top players in the league good enough to be in Hall of Fame that's exactly right just the start of this game remember they met early this year earlier this month or last month shall I say earlier in December and the Lakers won that game 107 to eight Here Comes LeBron LeBron by well he set Camara up perfectly for that one he loves to do that particular move Portland has got to take better care of the basketball they turned it over 24 times in their last game boy eight was setting up a bit of a camp underneath and they found him and he scored he do a little screen though by eight as he ended up with r on him right up under the hoop holding on to it Hayes comes out we'll see about his conditioning here tonight look at this and running the Baseline and throwing it down is Rui Hachimura timeouts well I tell you you just cannot chart get used to it still every night so in fact there was a bunch of them that I purposely left out because I know you'd be looking at me going what Simons drifting shooting scoring that was a tough shot I mean not only did he have to really do some work to get by Christie then he floated on the shot as well think about an didn't start great shooting this year but typically in his career he gets better as the year progresses and it's happening again this season for Simons for three well short that time but Austin Reaves gets it right back look at this look away pass he's down the middle he ran over a man and that's going to be a charge yeah Camara was as a player you have to know that so you know who's going to be challenging who you have to worry about changing direction that's his 15th charge that he's taken already to season nowar has it rejected they're going to count it on the go I I didn't think that was goaling at all ja is kind of agree with from line but but Jaxon Hayes was shaking his head immediately and we kind of all were was a surprise call to begin with if they had called it the other way obviously I mean it was a 50/50 on the floor so the Lakers have the basketball and it's 98 Lakers are down right now Reaves right in front of his own bench well you can see The Scouting Report has been heightened on Austin Reaves they are really face guarding and making sure he doesn't do much when he doesn't have the ball they're not letting him get back to getting the ball much eight hits midrange yeah Austin Reaves is started 0 for three 0 for two from downtown remember he really played sloppy basketball early in the game and then tight things up turnover wise the last three quarters and really had some Sensational numbers including that 35o effort and there's his first three right there well they they ended up switching on the play and Ayton gave him some air space and that's all Austin needed yeah so he tied his career high in points the other night one game after setting up career high in assists and answering right back of the Blazers they're playing pretty high quality offense here the Blazers shooting the ball in the first quarter yes they are six 62% their are bottom four offense and defense th languishing near the cellar of the West and the Lakers are the ones that turn it over turnovers weren't the problem against Cleveland after they tightened it up Avdija goes all the way to score that was a decisive move leic and taking his time and letting a run by as Max Christie you see how quickly LeBron got the ball to Max Christie that was that's just beautiful you give up a layup but then you get a layup on the other end LeBron already with three dimes in the game see a couple of substitutions in a matter of moment for the lake show and for Portland we got a whistle with 635 remaining in the first there we have a moment let's pause for this from Carls Jr it's pretty obvious what's going on with his season it's one of his best scoring seasons one of his best shooting Seasons anywhere inside the arc his perimeter game though has really been strl so keep an eye on him as the game progresses one you just look at as a whole offensively he's having a good year Reaves directing traffic bounces now here comes Koloko wow I mean he held it over his head a long time normally when you show the ball like that you end up getting fouled or blocked he he got neither on the floor for the Lakers you've got Max you've got Koloko you've got Reaves Finney Smith and Rui Sharpe for the side oh go Rui Rui you got caught smile Rui you know you here he is with the basketball Sharpe a shake and B here he goes all the way and scores but they're attacking to paint just about every possession and it's a four-point lead biggest of the game for either team we've had three lead changes tied a couple of times here in the first stanza Avdija goes up with the ball F now it's loose going to be taken by the Blazers out of the right hand side it's Sharpe heavy workload for him obviously goes into a little dance Finney Smith he's obviously one of the better Laker Defenders now and G has that rebound fall right into his lap as he heads into the front Court Austin now Finney Smith he's got the three his only bucket the other night was a putb dunk he missed two threes in his debut yeah but he's still just trying to feel comfortable with the new team Camara and rebound now to Dorian Reaves again handling Knecht is in the game Reaves straight away Christie was thinking about shooting it then fumbled it picks it up still plenty of time on the shot clock Knecht for three oh heartbreak got robbed that time totally got tapped on that shot in front of his own bench that's an airball what do we say about Sharpe and shooting threes yeah but the good job by Austin really going to his right shoulder and making him break concentration Sharpe as one for from down Knecht he fumbled it again two in a row for Finney Smith got to get the ultimate of bounces and he doesn't it goes up over and out 7 eight minutes have a field goal and that's what you have to do with the absence of Anthony Davis you've got everybody's got to make sure they contribute and I mentioned the bench the bench is the the second worst in the NBA and they only had 12 the other night against Cleveland scoot from the outside hits a three he's second on the team and assist and steals points per game about 11 and a half for Henderson 228 bumped on the outside Max is going to pull up just inside the free throw line wasn't close rebound taken by the Blazers here they come rip cityon gets fouled from behind pushed from behind by Knecht he where you grant the finalist will be selected and featured on Lake .c where fans will vote for the winner Atlanta they've been playing really good basketball they did lose their last game the other night against Denver got blown out actually by what I think 19 but prior to that they had won four in a row that's going to be a tough one tomorrow night right back here they're all tough here's Christie bounce to Knecht well he was cut off right there is right there and the T was missed by Koloko Clingan is a big guy yeah I'd say he's very big big guy here's Christie no 50/50 ball going to be taken by the Blazers down the midle go Sharpe to throw it down I tell you Shan Shaeden Sharpe is really venturing into the paint seemingly no matter who's in there defensively he's getting there by the way Keegan's brother Chris Marie is in the game and he's playing Chase mode right now to Reaves and under it's all about Koloko Koloko was looking for the foul he looked at the official then got up and just ran down the floor Lakers down by six slow start for the purple and gold K now over in front of their own bench that's Murray Murray trying to do a windshield wiper move that's a good actually a really good cut that time by Camara well he yes he did he did a great job of bailing out his teammates yes he did Murray didn't have really anywhere to go and Toumani Camara with the bucket Reaves good pass wide open Knecht boy Austin draws a crowd does he yeah yeah and the word is out I mean everybody knew he was a good player but he has stepped it up so much that they are paying all their attention to Austin gets to the basket on his own so good at it reverse layup hit the bottom of the Rim it's going to go out of bounds we'll see some without one of their best players tonight Jeremy Grant who's out again with a facial contusion so you're going to miss Jeremy tonight at least that's the word you would have started you would have think you would think yeah he definitely would have yeah here's Shake oh he gets it right back from LeBron spins is two-man basketball at the moment finally finds the red hot Koloko from down low he can't hit that little hook shot going to get it right back fire it back out to the perimeter they'll reset good Hustle by Finney Smith finally got an illegal defense called against the Blazers couple of nights ago against Cleveland I mean he was only 15 he converts the technical foul so it's a five-point deficit for the Lakers with a minute and 20 left in the first Milton's going to bring it in to LeBron James te fouls three on the Lakers just one on the Blazers and that one is an inadvertent kick so we play on Blazers bounce and that's going to be Simons unable to control it out of bounds it goes look at this bumping and grinding out on top so that's going to be the first foul in the of course shaky is really bounced around five SE in Philly now his sixth team in his seventh season five teams since the start of last year LeBron lays it up at in with the left hand I love it when players pass and then make a cut to the basket or go set the screen instead of just passing and standing operating out near the logo the alternative Courts for the Lakers here tonight with five to shoot into the corner going to the basket and nobody there to help or stop Camara the clock get a lane and no contest on the defensive side for the dunk yeah wide open Baseline they are shooting St 60% in the first quarter they're getting a lot of it inside too they're not a good shooting team either and you look at the numbers James is underneath puts a couple of guys in the popcorn machine Koloko cleanup time time Koloko is long you see how he just reached out of his reach but he retrieved it Blazers should get the last look shot clock is off going to fire up a long three they're going to get an offensive rebound and a foul that's good work by Murray always ready for those yeah but it's not about golf really yeah the Lakers new faces Dorian Finney Smith and Shake Milton arrive and get familiar with their new team how about that assistant coach Lindsay Harding reflects on her journey becoming the first female assistant coach in Lakers team history that's a very cool story Plus Anthony Davis Rui and others get mind readings from here come the Blazers they played the Lakers without Reaves and LeBron the first time around now they're playing them without Anthony Davis Lakers had no problem winning that other one however they run over a man and it's going to go back the other way charging and taking the Les first meeting the Lakers won the turnover battled by six Portland only made nine out of 36 threes in that game holding foul on scooter scoot Henderson Ron will bring it in for Rui Hachimura he had a big game first time around 23 points led the Lakers and down here goes OB with some speed got to stop the ball instead it'sing underneath the score Avdija every time he's had it in semi- transition he has really put pressure on the defense with speed Donova two national champ with UCONN  Rui underneath and th right into the defender's hand that's a technical foul for o legal defense so D will go right back to the line he had one of these just a few moments ago in quarter number one all right Laker fans tacos are on the line again if the Lakers win you're going to score a couple of free tacos with a drink purchase tomorrow from J in the box that's tomorrow if the Lakers are victorious that was a strange 3 second violation for defensive 3 seconds because Rui was in the pain himself so wow that's I was going to say so why why make the call then why the call I have no idea here is the ball out to Hachimura LeBron with four to shoot got to get into his action and he does all the way to the rim and they can't stop him LeBron James especially when he puts it in at left hand he's got six points Bo the scoring is really spread around for the Lakers just W in the game in double digits and that's Sharpe for the Blazers and now Avdija goes downtown they're playing right now with a ton of confidence behind the back this is part of a five game Road Trip for them and then they go home for five nobody stops Sim I was saying the same thing nobody stopped him they're very fortunate on that drive that coast to coast drive and kick LeBron down the middle he goes That's a block yeah he was in definitely in the restricted area I thought so LeBron will be going to fifth in total free throws made so I think you get the up by five with LeBron shooting a second of two and missing the Lakers beat him 3 in the season series last year looking to go 20 up this year with two more remaining in Portland Murray good composure that time getting to the Basket in the paint and points in the paint 20 so far for Portland they are tied with the Lakers in that category Lakers usually in the top 10 there LeBron hits a three step back three basically with a big guy hand in his face LeBron coming up with his fourth straight 20-point game Knecht with the defense but the foul as Simons was looking to score at 13 back on December the e8th when the teams met he had in a back injury turned 21 years of age the first week in February he had that two game stretch against Dallas and Utah where he scored 37 points had 16 assists then took a downturn in their last game against Philly the game that they were beat 125 103 in Rui he can't knock down a three and Portland to the right inside and Murray he wants to drive and does noar as he brings it right back out to Henderson boy really tried to sell that one didn't he and then scoop just got right in front of that underneath obvious scores boy LeBron was streaking down to side but scoot did a good job of getting in the way Lakers down 4134 been mostly Portland here in the first half that one Swit through by Austin Reaves Portland has been very aggressive on both ends especially the defensive end they're getting up in the Lakers and making their routes a little bit difficult again Austin missed the last meting he was out for four straight games I was part of that oneing got the rebound him a fres after the by Simons Simons now with nine with eight goes all the way to the rim and LeBron was there now James comes back the other way into the attacking Zone he wants to get to the basket stops cut off Milton back and so the Lakers shooting 43% and just three for 11 from downtown to start the game down the middle goes Simons to score Shake little scoop pass goes out to LeBron straight away comes up short so again three-point shooting not good for the lake show just 25% and they are down 43 to 36 and chony wants timeout all free throws on Tuesday a season high he got to the line double dig way more than anybody else did the other day for Breakers and here he has a rebound into the corner that's going to fire it up and Max Christie hits a three max you know Max only five points against Cleveland didn't attempt a shot in the first or fourth quarters was quiet against Portland in the first beating made some noise right there from outside drives the lane to be off Target they B they batt they poke at it going be taken by Max Christie Jaxon Hayes right there in the middle of it changing a lot of people's minds red is going to try from long distance and one thing about Jaxon Hayes he is the Energizer isn't he he will be anywhere everywhere running up and down the floor yeah but he's got to be careful I mean he's there stting starting center tonight he can't get himself into foul trouble and not get quality minutes yeah unforced air that time by Henderson and Christie so from both sides of the floor he's made a triple tonight yeah and good find by Austin that's a crosscourt pass knowing his teammate was wide open 35% around the year from downtown Portland out of their 177 field goals so far 11 have been at the rim and they were trying to get it there again Ayton had good position on a shorter Defender but the pass was well off the mark this is no news flash their bottom five in turnovers in the NBA Knecht comes out to get it hands off to Reaves are going to give Murray some help at least they tried to he splits the defense down he goes it's still loose and selling out on the floor and a good play with Sharpe way a tap to his teammate now Camara the size Advantage reddish look out first row there's reddish with those quick hands of his always around the let him play there I kind of like that reddish has a steal and five straight games got his hand on that last one that lob is I think intended for a wasn't going to do him any good over there and they turn it over again now it's re behind the back kick it for match no we were thinking weren't we yeah he he left the corner he made his first two from each of the corners again attacking the basket mentioned it right right away when this game started there's the third foul on Jaxon Jaxon is saying I didn't but the Lakers don't have a challenge on that verticality right free throw time for Portland hey Laker fans under the calljacob.com Lakers game night sweep Stakes for a chance to win tickets to an upcoming game now to anner visit calljacob.com Lakers trivia and he went one for eight from three the other night in fact he's done that three times in his last 10 games that's not the kind of consistency you want 30% from long range in December falling down and get knock down that's an offensive foul that'll be on here crypto.com Arena very quiet crypto.com Arena for the most part tonight Lakers gambling with Jaxon Hayes having three A's going to try one from distance and Hayes controls Aon is not a good three-point shooter 24% for out there but he is good down here multiple blocks in three straight wide open good Bounce by Austin and the Finish By it's the movement without the basketball that make play look so good if if Jaxon a just stands and spectates Austin had picked up his drib well there was nothing for him to do well we all know where Jaxon Hayes shoots his Avdija drives and scores Jaxon Hayes coming back leads the NBA in field goal percentage I mean he he's just right there on the cusp and everything that he shoots his right there but he can't score that one he knows he should have converted that one Sharpe runs over man that's going to go the other way as Austin takes the charge it's been determined that Reaves establish a legal guarding position in the path of Sharpe prior to his upper shooting motion therefore the calling the floor stands as an offensive foul that's good for the game Flow right 4644 again we've only had three lead changes Portland has been ahead most of this first half Lakers without Anthony Davis tonight cursing an ankle LeBron tight quarters and that's a one for Max Lakers looking to win their 19th of the Year well they're two and two in their last four if you want to look at a glass full they've won six out of nine they're seventh in the west but just a game out of fourth is everything bunched up Christie the Lakers leading scorer right now gets double team and it cost him a turnover good job of blindsiding by LeBron double him up without him knowing not sure Panic is the word but he certainly threw it away pretty quickly LeBron yes sir from three well both ends of the floor he makes it happen I like the surprise almost like a semi Blindside Blitz second three for LeBron Lakers as a team have six Christie has also hit two one from each Corner again they attack the rim throw away right to Christie what a good play by Christie Here Comes LeBron and he fumbled it oh and now Reaves in the corner now go back to that play by Christie well it's a three-on-one making a four onone oh ja get it out of here as they go four onone on Jack energetic player so happy to be back out on the floor last play on November the 26th did Jaxon Hayes against Phoenix almost two blocks of game so he was playing really good basketball before he went down Murray no that's a Camara excuse me Camara Camara hits to three he's a 34 percenter the basket made a quick First Step move to the basket Reaves gets the assist Lakers have really done a good job of rewarding the screener at the other end Lakers have a chance for the break here they come it's four on three the middle man the BCE Koloko tries to throw it down it's taken by Reaves that would have gotten the crowd going a little bit we're under two minutes LeBron again deep down for LeBron James oh LeBron has got a real pep in his step again tonight you think about it all the damage that he's done against Toronto in key games they call it score in the history of the game a Sharpe rattle Les in two free throws both of them were pretty flat but he got him the fall linkers up by four 5551 trying to get into the locker room with the advantage remember we're sending it back to the studio Jack of the box after arm report a little over a minute got double foul LeBron and Anfernee Simons Mark Davis the official said you both were holding each other and oh the turn Christie Christie from Reaves christe's having himself quite a game he's got 14 second on the Lakers LeBron's 18 and that's coming off with just a five-point effort in 28 minutes against the Cavs so tur it on Sharpe here he goes looking to throw it down boy there was a collision now it's the Lakers and Reaves I tell you something Shaedon Sharpe tried to highlight everybody on the that play didn't convert it but woo seven points now for Austin but nine assists there's your new point guard fulltime point guard LeBron here he comes LeBron bounce trying to find Reed BYOB the way it's a career high nine assists in a half for Austin he only has seven points but he means one of my teammates has got to be open listen I think the four rebounds are impressive too four boards LeBron Bo they were right in his face that time the shot clock is off they will Whittle it down and they hope to take the last shot but the Lakers will lead at the half they're up by nine right now the biggest lead they're still shooting 50% from the field and losing Lakers at 48% with four with three with two pull up jump shot at buzer Lakers close here they liked shots that they were getting and they liked the quality of shots that Portland was getting so they felt like they they're have a good system there in place for the second half yeah Mike 24 to8 close for the Lakers in that quarter as uh DeAndre Ayton has an easy little lay in right at The Rim same play all play all teams run and Lakers have had that play in the first half with Jaxon Hayes Max Christie already closing in a and he's going to get two more free throws he set that career high showing that he's got some offense to show at 12 points in that second quarter Outburst for the Lakers LeBron the other night against Cleveland three of the Lakers had 86 of the 110 that they scored they relied on the big three and that was just about it right now it's an effort up and down although LeBron and Christie are the big scores everybody contributing on the outside that's Camara you heard JJ reck talk about his defensive prowess and one reasons why he's been guarding Reaves a lot the Reaves this time drifting shooting missing and it's taken by DeAndre a might have gotten hit in the head AO oh that's a tough Play What a circus play that would have been good effort by a Reaves open fly by ru3 no sir Tak by the Blazers Blazers come in 11 and 21 has mentioned three and seven in the last 10 games this is one of six games in the NBA today nothing but net and that is Anfernee Simons a good job because Christie was challenging the shot Simons with back to back 20o game they lose track of Christie that's because they sent a double team on the box Christie just ran the Baseline and Rui with the good Vision there's your new career high for Max Christie got a whole half to play basically re tried to block look out Camara came gliding in and flying in for the rebound you know we mentioned that they are top five top five in the NBA offensive rebounds and second chance points that's why I was one of Stew's Keys tonight got to hold them down when they're top five in both those categories Reed distance 6457 Lakers trying to go 20 won the season series we'll see them again on February the 20th and then again oh whoa that time it hit the heel just trying to jam it home was Camara and that's a fivepoint switch I mean he was all alone running the Baseline and just couldn't get it to fall switch for the Lakers and then they get one right back though with Simons Anfernee is a 33 percenter on the year he started about a half the games he's played in the NBA and of course that means coming off the bench the other half pretty much equal in that regard on the boards Rui Hachimura misses yeah R's in a little dry spell here you know Camara had six offensive rebounds in their game against Philly the other night six that's good work to Reaves he's into the front Court surveys the situation drops it for LeBron it's deep it's down for three and that was deep you distance that's not a easy shot to shoot without sometimes adding a little extra and just like that the Lakers shooting 37% from Beyond The Arc they were very poor to start this game Avdija he's headed for the rim and he Scoops and scores Deni Avdija from Israel LeBron hangs in the air somehow the Bullet Pass finds Christie it's his night it's Christie's night he's right 21 game high he's got 21 on 11 shots and they come right back and drill a three and it's Simon's third qu by the way he's at it again he and Max right now separating themselves from the rest of the Austin has a chance at a triple double tonight by the waye now to LeBron for three yes that's him good ball movement I tell you good he's got 27 on 14 shots he's got six threes six threes tonight for Braun coming around a pick Simons Simons has 12 he's been really at work this quarter Lakers a difficult shot by Simons that time yeah oh Reaves goes behind his back he thought about throwing a l to Jack they got to look at each other but Reaves scores it himself Well Jack St for sure was coming to him yeah he did Austin said I tricked you didn't I I'm going to take that he's got 91 and seven foul 62 really 72 280 he's all of that too LeBron takes the fumbled dribble and then that's a kick kick save and a beauty it goes out of bounds this the Blazers as a team he only had nine threes and 36 attempts in the first meeting here in Los Angeles in early December Christie rebound is cradled at that time by Shaedon Sharpe Sharpe looks to get into the lane does a battle underneath it's going to be Portland ball there are no challenges left in this game by the way and all go to three offici what year was that all the way put it up an end I don't remember what year it was but when they had two they listened to a lot but they took a lot and they gave a lot they gave it yeah it was there was a lot of give and take there yeah there was some give and take there and a lot of personalties that was deflected so LeBron could go back court Shaedon Sharpe has missed his last six from the field actually Shaedon Sharpe is now out of the game oh no there he is he's still in and they knocked that one down there's Camara again just knocking down that little left that little that left-handed shot of his Christie oh that's what clingan's going to do for you yeah yeah oh seven two of him that's good play by Deni Avdija look at him got a technical for tating yeah you saw what he did and we we can show that was pretty obvious that that was coming I don't understand why players do that in the first place I mean 72 so Blazers battling back a bit aim Milton has played six minutes Finney Smith has played a dozen the two newest Lakers and Dorian is in the corner War number 17 it's Jaxon Hayes out of Reaves Reaves goes around the pick by Jackson leans in it hits the front of the rim and King's got the rebound he takes up a lot of space yeah that was a good box out too obvious out it again that's a good dish toing who missed the layup he was right there I should have tried to flush that Reaves Drive kick Milton Shake's going to come out the other side a bit Hayes is real no threat to shoot it from out there reddish looks to attack he goes all the way high off the glass rebound to Jack stri out of bounds they thought it went off his leg I did too yeah from up here and chick's Nest looked like it might have look like it Ma you got Reaves with 424 remaining in the third quarter third quarter action here in Los Angeles shoot a it's good play underneath Finney Smith can't finish Dorian was right there that's a bad pass too far good idea bad execution ran out of real estate that's right right out of the end zone there's a reason they have the lines on the floor see if we can get this crowd going a little bit tomorrow night Atlanta we'll have it for you is pregame tip Milton and then the Lakers go on the road to Texas step they'll be in Texas good job by SC good by job by Shake getting into no man's land and taking the easy 10-footer what's also interesting to Lakers you know they have this back to back then it is literally every other day the Lakers have a game until the end of January that means they get a day off half three weeks was joking about that the other day so how are we doing that absolutely correct absolutely Koloko Reed takes the hand off and scores for three and that's some of the reason why they're showing so much respect to Austin they know uh he's playing at a real high level 13 11 and seven for Reaves three more rebounds he's got another triple double and the word is definitely out around the league definitely out underneath by the way we wish Maxwell Lewis the best he got hurt in uh that's what I heard tonight did he yeah that's what I heard all right how about this right now from Nissan one out of two just to revisit that yeah DLo got carried off the floor tonight Max unfortunately is out for the year here's Reaves now Koloko holding on to it give it up to shake one of the two new Lakers with the left hand good play by Milton really nice play by sh I mean when you don't have to bring that second hand to the ball The Bigs don't know they don't know really when to jump to block it Jake got four Laker bench has 17 they're out scoring the Blazer bench 171 Camara kind of dribbled himself into trouble they got him boxed in thus far so they can continue this for the next four 14 and2 minutes he'll be in good shape you know what's interesting and it's it's really showing again tonight you know the Blazers defense took a bit of a nose dive in December but what's interesting is during the course of each game their defense gets progressively worse when you look at the numbers they start off playing pretty well in the first and second quarters and by the end of the game and you pretty much had them there's Finney Smith well you talked about consistency and a good example LeBron Finney Smith that's going to be wide left it is and he had to rush it and all the way underneath and they put it up an in Bon Dalano Banton you know where he went to school he's a great Corn Husker from Nebraska Dalano Banton they have two players on the roster from Nebraska good shouting here is LeBron live and trying again in fact just tap it in just have it hit the Palm or my finger tips or something it's going in and give the assist there were a couple of players that got a hand on that one yeah 17,0 812 in the house tonight hope to see you tomorrow that one's out of bounds scoot tried scoot Henderson tried to crosscourt off to dribble pass it was it went across court all the way into the stands scoop piles up some some numbers though seven and a half assists three and a half steals three games here's LeBron LeBron turning looking shak's in the corner o Shake hit the side of the board that's going to be a 24 second violation did that hit the H the back side of the not only the side but the back the back side of the board back side of the edge of the board you saw which way it went normally when it hits the board it like comes right back to you or so he was he was rushing that to try to beat the the clock no no question about it Banton shot clock is at 13 game clock is at 42 scoop trying to go all the way that was high off the glass lers have an opportunity Milt hand off to LeBron J Vinny Smith gets it blocked but stays with it and then Dorian throws it away and then gets it back got it right back that'll be a nice little defensive stat for him that's steel those are change of possession so they should get a a full 24 and not yet they put it at 21 they had it at 14 six plus Seasons with the Mavs before the trade to Brooklyn he was part of that Kyrie deal games for the Nets before the trade and by the way his points per game is the best of his career and he's also a career-high three-point percentage this year shot clock is just barely ahead of the game clock LeBron looks to get to the rim drifting missing Koloko now

not going away it's single digits teams don't generally go away in the TNS came against Utah Denver and Dallas now Dallas did not have Luca in that game as he's really been in and out of the lineup but be Dallas and Denver couple of times in their last six games they are more than capable five four LeBron got it ped LeBron shot there's that impossible shot to defend points off a turnovers Lakers have doubled them up 2211 that's not a shock Portland has all kinds of issues keeping control of it Lakers are going to get it with Finney Smith now back to LeBron 317 and two he's made 12 field goals six from Beyond the Austin Reaves in 30 big minutes Austin's also played 30 minutes vny Smith looking to get to the rim that's a good kick out though to Christie Finney Smith good little dish to Christie who hit the three and Christie continues with the hot hand he's five out of eight from behind the arc 24 points just blowing his former uh career points out of the water I remember it was at 17 and now he's at 24 reees holding on to it we're past the halfway mark by the way of this fourth and final quarter back to 88 LeBron holding on to it Christie at the buzzer a break opportunity for Portland will shovel pass for Deni Avdija got Reaves right in front of himAvdijalooking to get in there boy he creates some contact and then the backand layup is good he's been playing downhill quite a bit again tonight almost about to turn 24 tomorrow that'll be his birthday here's Reaves short oh and it goes right to LeBron fortunate for the Lakers they get a fresh 14 we under 5 minutes to go good interior pass ma very unselfish to the wide open Rui nice Dive by Christie I mean very nice dive all right we've entered the final five minutes of the game brought to you by mangu Casino Resort and Spa Camara goes all the way to the hole can't hit it but gets his own rebound and scores it that's what you don't want to see guys take a shot and get their own rebound everybody everybody leaking out for the Lakers trying to go the other wayar has 18 points so they've got four players three of them with 17 and the other one with 18 nice balance ooh mustards off the hot dog there and still a little warm all right how about this right now from Morango third one there's still over four minutes left JJ wants to take a time out after a replay or they looked at it for the review and then the timeout that gives LeBron a lot of rest and he's just now getting up and going back to the score T yeah so you're right and not a lot of game time actually expired Reaves launches and Portland is definitely in this game they've got the basketball down by only six and three and a half to go trying to move on Rui cutting is Avdija they find him and he is fouled hard by Reaves again that happened because AI had just out shooting the Lakers by a significant margin and it's not like the Lakers are shooting a ton of free throws either they've only shot 10 remember the last game had 18 throughs the Lakers had only nine we've got ourselves a brand new game yeah that discrepancy cures a lot of ills 10197 it's kind of a shocker that it's down to four Lakers led by 15 and we cruising they're making the Lakers use up quite a bit of clock just to get into their offense and LeBron's trying to get to the rim and does and can't score oh he was right there and it wouldn't go downAvdijahas been very aggressive he's got a good defender on him though and Finney Smith he's going to hold him up there now they switch off Sharpe goes right around Smith all the way is it a Sharpe or a charge it's a charge LeBron was there to take it is only four trying to win their 19th of the Year underneath is Christie what do you always say that if you get open somebody number he will find you yes he has always made the right play so LeBron in the assist Department tonight eight along with his 31 three-point shot is good by Simons what a second half half for Simons so one possession game 103 100 Christie Lakers up against it with 215 clock running trying to return the favor of LeBron LeBron gets it and scores oh the Lakers very fortunate LeBron hanging right with it oh yeah that ball could have bounced an inch in another direction that was a turn 19 of his 23 in the second half they're going to find Sharpe he doesn't want the three AIO will and rebound Rees that's his eighth rebound 105 100 boy that play LeBron nearly lost it and got it and laid it in could be a big turnaround play Christie scoring machine Max Christie we got fouled by and tied the game Good Touch by Max and he's got 28 points in 30 minutes not bad for a guy that got more playing time because of his defense and then when they inserted him in the sparting line of things are really good two hand Jam by Sharpe with authority and Christie turned his head got back cut so singing his praises and then he loses him defensively still with the basketball Finney Smith Give It Up to LeBron they only need one more scratch here 107 102 it's five-point game Sharpe is on LeBron LeBron looks like he's going to take it himself and he will for three got it LeBron James say good night now you don't give up frees at the other end block that time by Rui but it another goal tending call they're going to review up there's no other way to look at that does not go the Lakers way Christie guarding the basketball Sixpoint game 45 seconds remaining Christie into the corner they have plenty of time still LeBron the man with it going to get doubled up now he's got to get rid of it into the corner here comes vny Smith vny Smith all the way can't score the only thing about that possession was good they used up all the and then they foul Avdija in the back court and his anxiety to make a play Reaves fouls him not a not a good play there although they had the good job of it so now you just don't want to give up a three a two doesn't really do anything to you a three huro nobody has a foul to give backand lamp is good just walson right in that time was scoot now they got a foul now you get the ball in the hands of your Shooters after you take the timeout in advance MJ and LeBron James tied right there well let's see what they use as their out- of bounds play to get free throws inbound Rui right back to LeBron here he goes reverse LP is Good from the other side of the hoop wow not only did they not get free throws they got a layup and they're up by six fire up a three Lakers are going to hang on and win it and go 2 with the season series against Portland and what a night for LeBron and what a night for Max
