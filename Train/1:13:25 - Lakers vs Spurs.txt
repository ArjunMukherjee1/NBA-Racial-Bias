 where he's been a pregame at the top with Michael and family and all the supporters of that so had a great time Point Land I mean he's not shot going to be taken by the Lakers and R right near brings it back to DAV well Rui just about threw it back court I was going to say it was that close to a backourt violation that was about a millimeter short not sure he knew exactly where he was in fact I bet on it now LeBron L and they cover that really well stolen away by San Antonio their defense has been getting better and underneath they L up and blow it that is blown by Castle well that was an absolute gimme ston Castle was all by himself celebrated rookie himself Rui working hard slam it home gets into the middle because Victor is going to leave him for the block his de fael out of Harrison Barnes who of course has a title on his resume Chris Paul one of the all-time greates in NBA history and the second oldest current player in the NBA with his buddy LeBron being the oldest and another turnover for San Antonio and again Castle was in the middle of it Castle was up against it a little bit better yeah he still should have had possession of that one Rui working Rui foul oh that's a close call there yeah and Chris Paul saying let's review it we're not even well two minutes into the game but he was more than just a defensive player I mean back when they ran the fast break the right way cop was a guy that made sure he fed a wing and what an option yeah what an option he took it to the hoop and that's where the koopal start all that they talk about lobs right now Chris Paul was going that back in the day and I'll tell you what C talks about chick and the Cooper Loop all the time kind helped Define his basketball personality so that's at halftime the ceremony Christie for three dipson comes out taken by Wembanyama out of France of course they lost the gold medal game to the United States in Lebron and Anthony Davis Vassell in the lane good little move turn around jump shot is pretty for Devin Vassell Vassell is a a scorer I mean this is a guy that can put points on the board so you got to make sure you respect his abilities course he missed some time recovery from that surgery on his right foot stress fracture that's in traffic it's going to be turned over by the Lakers one of the best in the league at handling the basketball the vict and he throws it down I mean anything close to Above the Rim is going to be Victor territory so you got to put a body on him as soon as possible the reigning Rookie of the Year who turned 21 on January theth Anthony Davis takes it right to him and he lays it up and in did a good job of utilizing the rim as a helper there did Anthony Davis Wembanyama by the way has a block shot in all but two games in his entire young NBA career he's got multiple games with eight blocks as he shows that Baseline mid-range jump shot I mean he keeps the ball obviously being as tall as he is and he keeps the ball high over his head there's really nothing you can do about blocking his shot LeBron for three knocks it down LeBron James he's coming off of an 18-point effort only shot it 12 times in Dallas that was one of the poor efforts of the year necessarily from LeBron but for the entire team a very shorthanded Mavs team who gutted it out the two big steps now it's the clean up by Wembanyama like I just said anything by the rim and if you're not on him to boxing sometimes that doesn't even help Austin mustards off the hot dog that was an intended behind the back pass for LeBron Stefan Castle who LeBron said very very nice things about last time these two teams met he knows he's going to be a star christe in the corner o it's the side of the boardy is Hustle by Austin trying to steal it away and out of bounds it goes this game currently sixth in the west Spurs 10th out of the right hand side as that challenge didn't amount to much Lakers don't even get an opportunity Chris Paul good job by Anthony Davis of smothering Chris Paul who wanted to throw a log Castle's underneath and he gets in and around LeBron to score the layup toughest shot of the night for him and he finally made one he's one for two they've got some uh some good young Talent it's a nice mix of a young talent and scoring each game with the Lakers double figures in his last two of course Christie was installed into the starting lineup three weeks ago Reaves top of the key offt Target it's taken by Victor Wembanyama  Wembanyama had 23 rebounds a career against the Nuggets recently look at this long three and he knocks it down I mean that's just ridiculous somebody that's that big has that kind of skill leVassell all over the floor really shot the three well in December not so much here in January just bullying his way in that time was Anthony Davis I mean Victor doesn't have whole bunch in his back pocket so Anthony Davis is getting into his body and getting the separation Harrison Barnes now Keldon Johnson who was the go-to guy for so long here in San Antonio now relegated coming off the bench but still a plays a key role turnover Lakers Chris Paul Johnson down the middle he goes all the way to score turnover will be always be an issue as the Lakers have already committed five Chris Paul currently sixth in the NBA in assists second all time Davis inside outside matching his counterpart yeah I knew Anthony Davis would be ready for the match up both of them right now sitting on nine points 18 17 5 minutes to play in an entertaining first quarter now back out for Chris Paul Godfather of bronnie James Harrison Barnes catch shoot knock it down Harrison Barnes lives in the corner it doesn't matter which side of the floor but he lives in the corner oh normally can't shoot on the road how about Dorian Finney-Smith knocking down his first shot well bad defense from transition from offense to defense by the Spurs never did get back to cover Dorian Dorian now eight for his last 14 his last three plus games from three-point Land Long Shot long rebound taken by Hachimura Lakers on the floor Reaves Anthony Davis Rui Christie and Finney-Smith here's your point guard Reaves back out for Anthony Davis another three going to come up short and Vassell goes up the ladder to get it 2120 we've had only one lead change in the game we've been tied a couple of times Keldon Johnson showed the basketball all the way but just had too much for Max Christie they did a good job of protecting the ball through a semi hook shot up there very nice looking move they on a gold medalist back in to Tokyo 2020 for Team USA vny Smith now guarded by Chris to take advantage did he traVassell everybody on the San Antonio bench certainly thought he did it's a they're going to be very forunate to get it Toyama and Victor now will reorganize Chris Paul little cross over on Reaves now to Vassell fire over Christie Reaves has the rebound Chris Paul by the way three steals already gaves that one wasn't close and the carum is settled by Barnes team shooting 57% for the Lakers 59% for San Antonio Paul that's a foul on Anthony Davis that's going to be number two free throw shooter in the NBA how about this right now from BMW contemplate Chris Paul always been a good free throw the Lakers get some subs first he had Miss since December the 1st what else would you expect he makes all three free throws and they go up by six with just under three minutes to go in the first Lakers won the first meeting by five they wion the second meeting by 18 going away both of those in San Antonio Anthony Davis got to be careful now underneath gabe Vincent Reaves be close but Finney-Smith had good position but cam was not well purchase the lake show 2024 City Edition uniform the uniform good at knowing that he has two so let's see if the gamble pays off again LeBron back on the court 31 total points in the two earlier games at San Antonio as a 40y old averaging 26 points and shooting 57% attacking the rim and scoring is Vassell all plays on the weak side are coming back to dominant hands so defensively you just have to recognize that Anthony Davis was not bumped but he rides it up and in as he stored away from Bassey third straight game against a Texas team for this Lakers Squad Bassey out on top cutting was Johnson they didn't find him Vassell champagne for three pretty good shooter too especially on the road going to go the other way to the Lakers I think for the first time this year here's reddish Jack is in the game oh LeBron tried to find Jaxon now here's Gabe in the corner on its way he's got it nothing but net for Gabe Vincent very good awareness by Jaxon Hayes while in the air he knew he had an open man with a three-point shot in the corner remember Gabe miss four with an oblique inj then had a quiet return they didn't do much in the scorebook in Dallas all the way is that's not a block they didn't even get a hand on it that time as Tre Jones looked to get it to the rim Dorian Finney Smith picked up the dribble we've only got a minute 13 remaining here in the quarter Vincent little backup three box out but it goes right to reddish and then it's blocked by Bassey good Play De player that his third career double double recently Lakers with six to shoot cams open he's really been having all kinds of trouble shooting the basketball from the perimeter this year again cat shoot not this time to battle underneath that's got to be a foul you would think over the back of Jaxon Hayes saying thank you I'll just take that out of bounds play two-point game biggest lead for either side both teams had early seven-point leads Lakers was 70 Jaxon Hayes now to LeBron James LeBron James bounce over to Dorian Finney Smith this is in his wheelhouse but he doesn't even draw Iron had no legs in that shot now shot clock is about four ahead of the game clock San Antonio is not played since last Wednesday so they've had a bunch of time off themselves Angeles for a few days champ peny with two with one Keldon Johnson the horn in fact it's after the horn and a 24 second violation yeah when the horn went off the ball was steing depending on who gets it if they can hustle it up or if LeBron tries to get it immediately into the front Court you got to get a shooter in the middle of the floor LeBron looking looking and finds Jaxon Hayes not a shooter yeah that have been a huge surprise reception you said a lot of players were there which is the ultimate respect for some a lot a lot of former players not only uh teammates but players that didn't even play against him were there so this that shows respect when you're going to get your jersey up in the Raptors that's that's the deal here in Los Angeles as LeBron hits the first shot of the quarter for the Lakers well did Harrison Barnes give him some space at 15 ft I thought he would crowd him just a bit more if the rest of the team for the Lakers can catch up to Anthony Davis who was five for six in the first quarter rest of the team was 5 for 16 Champagnie Castle on the outside National Champion Castle was Dalton Knecht in the game and he had a good game yes he did against them D he was a leading scorer in that game he had a good game and when you got a guy that can really drill it from the perimeter that seven in double figures the out shot the Spurs 53% to 4 screen by Gabe Vincent numbers I mean uh the eye test will even tell you but when Chris Paul is on the floor they are an infinitely better team I mean he is such a big part of what they do offensively he's got to be on the floor and then they're cooking a little bit Yeah but he he's a stabilizer I mean he keeps everything in order oh Castle throws it down with the two Hand Jam down the middle he go everyone thought he was going to lay it up with his left hand he said fooled you of course he spent hard time the starting line oh there's that wait minute whoa there's that onelegged one we saw that last game part of the Arsenal now we've seen it before but it's just always good to see Victor stop it yeah comes right back again almost half of his shots have been from Beyond The Arc he has a four game streak with double doubles look at these two stars going at each other as LeBron tried to hit it now it's Laker ball Jaxon hay on a good little tap that time to him hit him on the hand the referee said just take the deuce and go the other way you know Jack had missed his last three shots that never happens with him Victor for the finger roll around LeBron who was hoping or looking perhaps for a charge lob underne for reddish not going to Knecht out of bounds you know another look at with six six threes and four threes for the Spurs Spurs last g go ahead you got to say you have to make threes against the Spurs that's sure their last game was against Milwaukee they got beat by 16 points as they lay it up and in by Castle again they hit 18 threes in that game against the Bucks only problem is Milwaukee hit 19 that was a pretty nice move by Castle did a good job of job stepping yeah we were very impressed when we saw him in Texas Reaves short but the tap out goes to LeBron in the fresh 14 second quarter action here at crypto.com Arena bounce it to reddish they'll whip it over into the corner and that's blocked by Wembanyama and the streak of blocks continues that one comes up short four games for Victor this year with at least eight blocks four usually usually shoots that over to top of players you're not shooting that over the top of Wembanyama yes sir for Austin St Yeah Austin gets one Wembanyama wasn't there so now four lead changes in the contest Lakers back out on top by one wheny finds himself all alone on the scoop and score when he went to the basket on a couple trips down and missed a little bunny should have just reached up and dunk that he tried to finger roll and didn't have to he's averaging 24 and 12 in the two games against the Lakers this year Reaves got the defender Castle on his back reddish that's nice to see for cam yeah and cam likes the three-point shot from the corner so if he's going to hit one it's usually from there he's under 30% for the season though shooting from Beyond The Arc Lakers now with control of the basketball in the attacking 47 LeBron had a notion for a moment he's guarded by Harrison Barnes couple of vets right here locked up against each other the pick is utilized by LeBron now it's Wembanyama and LeBron on the outside the crowd recognizes it here comes LeBron that's a nice controlled play by LeBron over Wembanyama or at least around him well you could hear the crescendo the crowd recognize the matchup when they're on the perimeter LeBron took it right to him Wembanyama here comes the double see what San Antonio does with it and they foul Barnes the foul is going to be on reddish so much better when you look at his splits homean Road hey Laker fans tacos are on on the floor the only one not is LeBron Laker next game is Wednesday Miami will be here than Brooklyn on Friday and again there are two games at home to be made up one against Charlotte and another one against this San Antonio team to be announced later I tell you Austin just just puts lone assists at Dallas and he said I was really bad on both sides of the ball he will take ownership and of course he had been on a tear as far as delivering the basketball prior to that on the year fre throw percentage is actually lower than his first two years in the league we got some time up good his free throw percentage be lower this year than previous because of the number of attempts he's getting to the line L he's getting line a lot you know when you miss a couple when you get to the line a lot catch up hard to get it back up top yeah last couple years he's still good he's 8% let's un kid ourselves good rebound by Anthony Davis strong on the break in the jam by Christie that that happens at the right night honoring kopo and they come down tough as it got for him to beat the clock is a string we're going to get a fresh what a heads up play by Chris paulen he knew it he knew it underneath Barnes with a trio of Lakers surrounding him lays it up and in that just a heads up play that basket should go to Chris B well the Lakers right now they've attempted 19 threes and 13 tws this is more like we thought maybe a JJ RIT team would look like when he became the head coach Anthony Davis there's a two-point attempt and B again Wembanyama giving him too much space Chris Paul for three it settles in Chris Paul doesn't look to shoot it very often anymore he's the floor General but still very capable in fact the average is under 10 and speaking of JJ they were teammates with the Clippers from 2013 to 17 Rui open got it oh Dalton Knecht with the drive and kick how about that we often talk to Dalton is more than just a a stand and catch and shoot one of those guys like Champagnie is about to do right here weak side rebound Rui Hachimura and the Lakers lead by six one short of their biggest of the contest they look to snap this little two game losing streak they won their last home game against Atlanta Reaves turns all the way around and scores he's just I'm telling you something about Austin Reaves he's just a very heav good basketball player there's a lot of good basketball players but they're not all that smart you know he's averaging over 18 a game and he shoots a 44% which is not up to his standard I'm going to tell you right now he has been better than that should beama comes up Short's got it with little bit of momentum here's a three by kect Anthony Davis got a foul not a good one not a good one that's three the defense in the world with Anthony Davis but scoring wise he comes in tonight seventh in the league in points and he had a 40-point game earlier this year in one of the two contests against San Antonio Chris Paul throws it away right to Dalton Knecht defense offense slam again I talk about flat it's the Tuesday number that's last Tuesday against the Mavs T just trying to get back into Rhythm after having those two games postponed it's good to be back obviously still with everybody in the area not completely out of the woods yet but much much better than it has been obviously Jones underneath with the left hand that's good move by the little guy did a good job of stopping pivoting and then using his off hand who turned 25 on Wednesday he went to Duke also for a couple of years trying to get it to Jaxon Hayes it's a four on two trailer is Vassell for three got it Vassell on the wing the trailer on the three and it's 5549 for the Lakers that's nine turnovers that has turned into 13 San Antonio points he got to cherish the ball the Lakers had that issue i' say about a month or so ago they were given up a ton of those Vincent has it gabee with two Johnson tied oh nice defense nice you will not miss any of it by the way here in the quarter as Rui hustles it down and saves it for Gabe good Hustle by Hachimura Lakers are 12 of 16 Ste in a quarter that is 75% again trying to go higher that time and Bassey has control of it sign for the Lakers to bench scoring 17 for the Lakers six for San Antonio yeah that's a big plus yes it is because the Lakers bench has not been good this year they're coming through so far here this evening Jones Johnson the longest 10 spur as mentioned again that's good little fake by Vassell but he can't hit the 15-footer Dorian Finney-Smith of course played many years in Dallas one of the rivals of San Antonio Gabe shoots the three that's going to roll around and come out under two minutes you hear the voice of Lawrence taner in the background by the way he's about to be inducted into the Southern California sports broadcasters Hall of Fame LT very well deserved congrats on that say that different than just SP everybody else Johnson from outside so congrats to both of them Pepe NLT LeBron nice look at this look atce the fin by marvelous look from LeBron do you say it a thousand times say it a thousand more love to hear it oh couldn't get the three-pointer play though minute and a half to go in the half as Wembanyama back on the court 10-point Laker Advantage holding San Antonio to 49 nicely done so far theel the rainbow though out of the roof fael can score and he can score and he's not afraid of the moment he doesn't care who's in front of him just goes out takes care of his business first Spurs player to make 43s in his first 250 games and they've had some really good players in that organization Rui answers back with a corner three right in front of their bench nice switch nice switch by Dorian and Austin by the way he made that right in front of Jeremy Sochan who is not playing tonight out again with back tightness and that really hurts them you can spot Jeremy a mile away with that green hair of his that he tinted for Christmas Hachimura he's alone out on the wing 13 to shoot LeBron doubled Ruiz open he's going to go to the dribble he's going to bounce it here they swing it to Christie I'm going to take it oh that rolled around and spun out oh the old motorcycle in the motor drone and the spill right out castle with four with three in the half Castle tough shot oh and the Lakers bail him out a bit with 1.3 all right just a reminder coming up halim the coup Copa power because his literally his hands were just ringing wet because he was so nervous he's changed had he I mean he's one of the great speakers in small groups he's outstanding Rees will count got a clean that yeah it's too many I mean cuz that equates to 18 for the game that's that's too many Wembanyama Little Fly By by Austin Reaves Vassell rattles it home from straight away so Vassell having himself a good offensive game 50% from the floor as is Victor 16 so far for Devin yeah he's got four three-pointers made LeBron just kind of waltes in there not with a lot of whole lot of urg as the Lakers look to go 13 and five the West if they can win it here here tonight hey by the way Lakers fans Lakers Ticket Exchange has your game day tickets don't miss your chance to see Lakers home games the resale Marketplace are your Lakers grab your seat it's 100% verified and secured go lakers.com tick exchange and find your seats right now one out of two for LeBron that's all too easy thrown down byy well it's easy because the Anthony Davis had to step out and help and like we just throw it up and he can throw it down LeBron gots it over into the corner for the wide open max out rebound Barnes shovels it now they're quickly into the front Court Castle just kind of elbowed Reaves out of the way as he was flying by and Castle scores it's a five-point game well it's going to be like that throughout I think back and forth Reaves leans in doesn't get the contact but does get the rebound chy not even hesitating fires it up and it fell right to Anthony Davis and he couldn't finish it but his headband is a skew which means he was fouled underneath just five out of eight from the line not a lot of free throws either side this will be the 16th free throw combined tonight hey on the next backstage Lakers new faces Dorian Finney Smith and Shake Milton arrive and get familiar with the new team now assisant coach Lindsay Harding reflects on her journey becoming the first female assistant in Lakers team history Plus Anthony Davis ruin and others get mind readings by Mentalist Oz Pearlman oo that's backstage Lakers Thursday January 9 on Spectrum Sports Net well one out of two for Anthony Davis so the free throw shooting continues to be a little SAR for the Lakers yeah for the year the Lakers 10th in free throw shooting so you know you would think with all these games where they miss big ones they be worse than that but still top 10 best free throw shooter in the league right there Chris Paul good feed underneath castle acknowledges that too the foul is on Hachimura well Castle does did what I really impressed LeBron he said he's going to be something special amongst rookies he's fourth in points third and assist and T now this one of six games tonight in the NBA next opponent Miami seventh in the East they have one three in a row and they are currently across town playing the Clippers so pretty good basketball we saw Pat Riley of course here at halftime Reaves short so you would think Patrick would stick around for a couple of days you would think right see his team Paul trying to get to the rim that's kicked out of bounds unintentionally by hachimura rakers need to stop on this possession just to get some some momentum going their way Spurs have cut into this lead which was 11 down to five chance to crawl a little closer first opening minutes of quarter number three Chris Paul finds the corner man Castle hits it and we've got ourselves a two-point game here Chris Paul in his 20th year and answering back is Rui Rui hasn't had a lot of shots but he's making the most of the ones he got he's three out of four at three out of three from downtown Castle remember he missed that first gimme to start the game ever since then he's certainly settled in Anthony Davis Victor in front of him oh and Anthony Davis grabbing his knee I think he's okay yeah I do two of the way it looks in he's what he get kicked probably yeah that's what I some play there on the defensive end by LeBron he strips W Wembanyama but didn't turn the ankle at all I think he's okay Rui theel in front of him and we'll see about Anthony Davis he's got the basketball right now going a one-onone with Wembanyama Anthony Davis little drible look at this Davis well he had to add a little bit of art to it because Wembanyama was closing and with him closing you better watch out for the block as a DA open the door and let him right through Chris Paul down in the middle he goes to lay it up and in you talking about reading the defense Chris Paul was looking to pass that the whole way until he said hey nobody's going to guard me 65th career game against the Lakers Drive kick maybe he'll advise might have gotten away with a foul on the outside hitting Castle but three just the down it goes just the way they drew that play up exactly scramble mode out near half court and then it's Max hit in the three s and a half to play in the third Castle shooting well here in the quarter shooting in the in the game yeah they are 53% or both teams right there both teams right there just about even the basketball you're not going to get that Victor is it a block it is out of bounds off a Rui yeah it's a block that went off well the Spurs actually have fallen to 12 but they're just oh look at Wembanyama went behind his back not a great pass trying to break it out and the Lakers in Lebron now get bumped by Chris Paul we certainly hope to see you at the intu Dome on Sunday so make your presence known I don't even have to ask I know you'll be there Sunday night there is LeBron laying it up and laying it in you know sometimes when you have a guy that can block shots like Victor defensively for yourself you kind of relax a bit you still can't relax Harrison Barnes relax and LeBron made him pay anonio the finale of a three- game Ro was supposed to be four but we had a postponed game laid up an in by Castle came out the other side and use the glass high off the Chris will just leave it there high off the board because Austin got into paint and said I know Victor's there let me shoot just a little higher 73 21y Old Anthony Davis got Bassy in the game guarding him Leon comes out to get it Johnson to body him up and they take it away from LeBron oh and they threw it off the c3's leg and they fouled LeBron wow Bassey made a good but then then got all team does have a challenge remaining the front Court that's how they do it now front Court back court Anthony Davis is fourth at allstar game will be in San franisco Keldon Johnson Bo they're just going at it aren't they right there he and LeBron he's been their leading scorer this season back into the game underneath again it's Castle boy he's really asserting himself now this is a huge quarter for him offensively yeah and he's got him back to a one possession game he does his 14 points singlehandedly bringing him back Anthony Davis attacking Bassey loves that match up good job of bouncing and then not using the window Massie or I'm sorry Bassey thought he was going to put it on on the window and he didn't Castle Drive kick but that was not a good play but R well also by Gabe Vincent who put himself in the passing Lane Gabe bounces Dorian Finney-Smith Who's Back In Action of course was a quiet along with Shake couple of weeks ago for Dow Davis trying to get to the rim and does not to be denied well having his way right now he's got 20 that's relatively efficient you can go ahead and add six rebounds to that nightly resume Jones all the way the byass to Spurs maybe is 163d game of the last 174 he's just been available for this team the last couple of years inin Smith drives to the basket Davis out of bounds it'll be Laker ball with 403 open Christie launch it Max Christie tonight finally knocks down another one there's no words for it it's just a a honor that I did not know was coming uh but again to be up there with to my peers and people I played with was such a great honor but uh yeah I mean this is I'm still an amazed at what's going on no question about it we very welld deserve you know that so many of these players have been speaking to us about how you need to be in the Hall of Fame you need to have your jersey up there what does it mean to have your teammates support you like that you know what that means that I was doing something right and for them to speak that highly of me I appreciate it because we held each other accountable on and off the court and it was just a great time to play with a a very great Collective group of players well you know of course the great St Lance is on our broadcast team here you think about his time with chicken quinting all of the terms like the Koopa Loop Steward trick you know what those two had a a aism all right last one for you coup uh you have such a special connection with the fans you grew up Pasadena here we all still today you mentioned that in your speech how about that community that you felt with Los Angeles all these years that's what it's about I'm very one of the few players in this league to ever play for their Hometown team and I just loved it you know I once I put that purple and gold on I could didn't see myself putting another uniform on but La is the place for me and I was glad I've been here for 12 years and help win five championships all right c number 21 up there in the r congratulations thank you Chris Paul you're the best and while we were talking to coup and thank you Michael it's been a dunkfest for San Antonio two by Wembanyama one by Vassell and now Anthony Davis work on those Ste isms would you that's my man C here's com chicken stew there's another foul on Anthony Davis Big Three for San Antonio keeping him in the game well and with Anthony Davis Anthony Davis picking up his fourth I'm surprised that Victor doesn't go to the box and do anything down there with that size oh look at this turn the scoop and the score by Tre Jones what a play and all of a sudden it's a two-point game LeBron trying to take charge and the Lakers just getting sloppy with the basketball they can tie it or take the lead for the lead Wembanyama and okay but they need one in somewhat they just need to stop this momentum how about a basket that will help it's a 10 run LeBron they throw it away again for San Antonio playing great basketball staying with it is Vincent well that was a very fortunate basket there Lakers had a turnover then the Spurs return to favor under a minute third quarter third quarter action Vassell couple of big step stop shoot scores again well he's eight for 15 Victor 9 for 16 and Castle is just lights out 9 for 12 three guys with 20 yeah Anthony Davis for three Davis some fresh snow from the outside good thing Anthony Davis made the bus 14 threes for the lake show only nine for San Antonio shot clock is six ahead of the game clock got a good one going for you here in front of 18,000 Vassell bounces off Anthony Davis gets it to the corner Vasell was there toat the hit the rim so they're going to get the fresh clock at the quarter at the quarter it's Keldon Johnson well it's only right that they get the basket the bench and full bloom out on the court right now for the Lakers here to start his fourth quarter led by LeBron the only starter out there bars as Ste mentioned we are even up at 89 Champagnie gets knocked to the ground they grab Bassey they grab Bassey that's going to be a loose ball foul on the Lakers yeah that'll be Jaxon Hayes with the push so they'll get a fresh 20 a fresh 14 s Antonio ended the quarter on a 15-5 run yeah those six turnovers that the Lakers had in that third didn't help him at all yeah and you called them out too I mean you said what nine the first half you're headed for 18 well they got 15 yeah unacceptable Johnson and he gets an and one no three first lead for them since 3736 and they knock it down so the Lakers looking up at the Spurs right now and nearly stealing it away is Jones oh he is harassing Vincent on the outside and now's a little chat with the ref oh the spin by Lebron k with a spin in the paint well that's his one of his favorite moves look at this defense Harrison Barnes Glides right to the rim Dalton Knecht in the lane going to have to do some with it he gives it to reddish he goes all the way and can't score he was right at The Rim Tre Jones champ Penny he's having a tough night from downtown he is 0 for six champag is much better than that here's Knecht he's going to go to the line look out look out another look at that move by LeBron he loves to set you up for the drop step that we returned basketball here in Southern California and by the way congratulations to to my Rams my Rams I know they they told me your name's on the paycheck every

reddish is one for six little bit out of control right now the Spurs but they've got the lead by three Chris Paul no they got the lead by six yeah they do as Chris Paul are just blistering the Lakers steing that they're getting a lot from their smaller players dribble drives into the painted area Max Christie little stutter step hangs in the air blocked by Keldon Johnson they reset the clock yeah they should not have done that they should not have done that and that's exactly what the San Antonio bench is complaining about they take it let's hope the clock's working turn over for those two longtime friends going at each other Anthony Davis will get a shot here he's 50% now two out of four Here Comes San Antonio after tonight they're going home for two games against Memphis Memphis one of the top teams in the west hand off now to Castle for three over Christie Anthony Davis got a fingertip on it and then controlled it Davis has another Double Trouble 26 and 12 and DED to knock down another three nice box out yeah really everybody standing around everybody boxed out that's why Chris Paul got a flat footed rebound at 6 foot that's about as fundamental as you're going to see right there Ste you're right it just seemed like oh they tip it up and in well Anthony Davis is out guarding a guard and nobody on the glass defensively for the Lakers Anthony Davis of course out there operating with four fouls there's only 815 remaining he turns and scores over Bassey won't be long till Victor comes back in cuz he's waiting at the table and next dead ball this Paul the quarterback Harrison Barnes goes Baseline Harrison Barnes blocked by Christie Barnes stays right with it stays right with it and scores the bucket 10396 he used a little bit of power on Max Christie that time all five starters all five starters for the the Brown's got what half a dozen and still over seven and A2 minutes left to play Down by seven and growing Chris Paul 20th year in the league finds Barnes

lead for the Spurs in this game a ninepoint game Lakers biggest lead was 11 we've had seven lead ch changes tied seven times under to AB they broke it upy right in the middle of it then the foul by Austin that's his second foul in a matter of when it comes to turning the ball over normally it's a strength not tonight credit this defense of San Antonio's much improved see how they go right back to that match up that they like ball little fake oh look wow they both into each automatic missed one all year he's got eight assists and 13 points three Spurs with at least 20 Ste was just mentioning that a little bit ago they knock it from behind another Laker turnover they knock it from behind on LeBron Pok it free Harrison Barnes it goes it doesn't go and he'll shoot free throws I mean it is dominating time right now for San Antonio and they're doing it in the mid post area they're just getting matchups that they like and they're exploiting them that's just smart basketball Lakers are the ones that have to make the adjustments Lakers began the night's sixth spot San Antonio again these two teams will meet one more time here in Los Angeles later in the year whenever they reschedule it before the Grammy trip will be the Boston Celtics and their only appearance here this year Well Lakers have their work now they got 16o deficit that's work LeBron James little lethargic right now this team Smith spark a little life into him not this time tapped by Anthony Davis but it goes to San Antonio and they will take their time after they shoot their next shot we will be past the halfway Mark of the fourth and final right back to that matchup look at Chris Paul directing traffic bares with seven with six Vassell who's had himself a game Vassell long shot long rebound chance for the break Reaves boy he surveyed the floor and found Davis trailing and rim running timeout after the bucket this is a good time out for the defensive they've had some issues they've been slumping from three but after a slow start to the year the defense is really solid and that's kind of showed itself here tonight Wembanyama spinning turning oh he remained in control and scored around Anthony Davis on off the window good control by Victor that time cuz he got some contact and it didn't really knock him off balance very much Austin Reaves pull up Corner the key not there tap to Vassell it is 11- 98 and the Spurs have the ball they're looking to beat the Lakers for the first time this year and in this losing streak wide open is Paul got to take it in and out no Wembanyama he was complaining a little bit but they're going to move on to the next side and taken away by Paul by the way we've entered the final five minutes of the game brought by Morango Casino Resort and Spa he will milk the clock a bit LeBron is going to come back in and Barnes that time tried to spin it up as pulling the chair falling down a little bit that time was Christie Anthony Davis attacking Drive kick Rui not there Vassell with the rebound 20 points six rebounds four assists for Devin Paul completely in charge of this game right now well he's directing tra almost Perfection look at this pass into the corner theel it settles in San Antonio is up big for comeback here late 13-2 Spurs run again Miami is here on Wednesday Baseline reverse layup rebound Victor Wembanyama that is his seventh board with 22 points rebounding tonight Lakers are actually a plus two they're being out shot though 53 to% to 46% this has been the match up the whole second half basically that the Lakers haven't been able to handle the Harrison Barnes match up yeah Chris Paul is runs pi and roll with Harrison Barnes and then he gets to screen guy to guard him and he's paid big div in those are two Wily veterans bar 17 Anthony Davis not there San Antonio is on their way to a win it's 116 to 98 and the Spurs take a timeout does and the L by Castle a 20 point deficit 23 for Castle 22 for Wembanyama 23 for Vassell and at the other end LeBron with a bucket just two and a half to play not enough time for the Lakers cuz they haven't been able to figure out this offensive uh formation for the Spurs they've scored just about it will it's interesting you look at numbers the Lakers already with the fourth worst Point differential in the west and that's going to get even even worse right now the bench is going to get cleared in a moment for the Lakers Castle weak side bounce oh look out look out Wembanyama takes it Wednesday by the way his sixth season as an assistant under Greg papovich that's a nice win for them V that's it for Mitch to Stanford you got Mamu in the game we're number 54 it looks like after this free throw the Spurs may just taking a deliberate foul to get Wembanyama out yeah be a good call Zack Collins who playing time is obviously diminished significantly recently he'll be coming into the game also got Blake Wesley in for San Antonio maybe they won 14 Zach's patiently waiting reddish
