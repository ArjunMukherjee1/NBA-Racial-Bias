from being by the Dallas Mavericks Doncic now joins LeBron James in the pantheon of Laker great in the beginning of a new era in Los Angeles and the NBA re incardinated how stargazing life goes on breaking news Mavericks are trading Luka Doncic who the Lakers Luka's been my favorite player in the NBA for a while now I get to play in the greatest club in the world Manny many Legends P here I didn't really believe it at first it was a bit shock I'm just excited to start this New Journey I have everything left to prove and the goal is to win the championship welcome to NBA Monday presented by State Farm the Lakers one of the hottest teams in the NBA winners of five in a row and nine of 10 take on the Utah Jazz as their new Superstar Luka Doncic teams up with LeBron James for what they hope is the start of a championship run Anthony Davis now injured with the Dallas Mavericks expected to miss possibly up to a month traded for Luka Doncic unb known to just about anybody outside of Rico Harrison and Rob pinka the two decision makers for the respective franchises the Jazz were actually a part of the deal had to get involved to make sure that the trade Could Happen sending Doncic to Los Angeles and Davis to Dallas you think of all the great nights in Laker history February 10th 2025 will certainly be one of them Luka expected to play 30 minutes in his first game in a Lakers jersey time now for the start starting lineups here's public address announcer Lawrence Tanner 77th year in the NBA this is a franchise with 17 NBA titles the home team your Los Angeles Lakers at one forward number 28 68 6 season from Japan Rui Hachimura at one guard number 15 65 forth campaign from Oklahoma Austin Reaves starting at Center number 11 7 ft six season out of Texas Jaxon Hayes at one forward number 23 69 22nd campaign St Vincent St Mary's High School an Allstar LeBron James and the other guard wears number 77 67 7th campaign from Slovenia Luka Doncic head coach JJ ring day pass alongside Tim legler to call the action George sadon will join us in a little bit legs you've been working at ESPN for 25 years you played in the NBA a long time how significant is this for the Lakers and the NBA for tonight and Beyond I've seen a lot but I haven't seen this this is unprecedented you're talking about a 25-year-old Superstar one of the most dominant offensive forces not only currently in the league but maybe that this league has ever seen become a available and the Lakers do everything in their power to get him to pair him with LeBron James so now you watch the bridge with LeBron and trying to win now but you also potentially get your first look at the future of the Los Angeles Lakers how do you expect it to play out tonight we mentioned JJ reck's going to play Doncic about 30 minutes in this game how will it work with two dominant ball handlers on the floor together there's going to be a feeling out process for sure when you have two guys with this kind of usage rate on the ball there's no doubt all ultimately their ability their talent their IQ will make this work I think right away you're going to see the luxury of having a player of this caliber on both sides of the floor that can beat you in any platform as a scorer and make any pass that has to be made tonight's starting lineups brought to you by T-Mobile one trade that did not go through Mark Williams was acquired from Charlotte that deal was rescinded he would have been the starting center instead Jaxon Hayes will be the starter at Center from here on out with aimore Austin Reaves coming off a 45-point game on Saturday for Utah Collier Clarkson Lauri markkanen and former Allstar along with John Collins year seven for Luka Doncic the third overall pick in 2018 by Atlanta traded on draft night to Dallas he'll turn 26 years old on February 28th he's officially a Laker right now he'll start on defense and extend on markkanen who missed the three rebound by Reaves and markkanen will start defending Luka on the wing here's LeBron James love for Hayes last time we saw James last Thursday he became the oldest player ever to score 40 points he had 42 in a win over Golden State and you see right away LeBron downhill with the late find and and that's what's going to be fascinating to watch him par with Luka who specializes in the pass that LeBron just made James out of there with it after an empty possession for the Jazz and here's Doncic driving puts it up instead it's a l and Hayes with the slam we know haLuka loves to lob it to his friends either guy gets downhill if you got shooting on the floor the lob threat for these centers is going to go to another level for the Lakers Clarkson with a basket Luka when you take his career scoring average and his career assist average and you put them together that number is higher than any player in NBA history Doncic off the screen gives it up again on the law this time broken up by Collins here's Coler the rookie out of USC finds Clarkson three not there and James with the rebound down Court knocked away from Doncic out of bounds nice awareness by John Collins on that last one but this is this is what Luka loves to do he loves to get into the paint he had weapons at his disposal in Dallas he's got another one here in Jaxon Hayes averaging eight assists per game this season he played only 22 games with Dallas Aura missed the dunk but count it goaling on Utah Luka has not played since December 25th he heard his left calf on Christmas against Minnesota it's the fourth time he he's dealt with that injury just his 23rd game played this season markkanen and catch and shoot it's it Lauri markkanen it for three yeah one of the real talented pigs in this league Lauri markkanen beautiful shooting touch does not need a lot of time or space to get that off waves with the big Kessler on him drives to the basket kicks it out Doncic hesitates fires and it's short on his first field goal try as a Laker doer with a little air space his three no good and Reaves comes away with it pulls up this fire on the triple try rebound Collins and the shooting may take some time with Luka you would expect that to be a little bit of a rust period for him but the playmaking will be immediate and the number of players he occupies on that end of the floor that'll you'll see tonight and every night going forward Collins trails at three backto back triples by Utah the Jazz has the third worst record in the NBA but they play you tough they just beat Golden State few nights ago took the Suns to overtime before falling Luka behind the back to Hachimura foul called that will send Hachimura to the line for the first free throws of the game for either team Collier picking up the foul we mentioned Nico Harrison the general manager for the Dallas Mavericks made the trade stood by the trade Mavs owner Patrick Dumont cited character culture used the word vacation as well in his first public comments since the trade to describe the reasons why they made the deal to get Anthony Davis an enormous risk on the part of the Mavericks organization and and I said this on Saturday it's going to come down to the fact that Dallas is betting against Luka Don's ability to max out what he is as a player potentially his ability to win in the future as the leader of your franchise they're betting against that Lakers Bet On It Collins beautiful move to the back basket and five quick points for him mentioned Davis got hurt last night drills a three his first points of the game and the first three for La a lot more out on the floor than just LeBron and Luka as well Rui hachimura playing the best offensive stretch of his career right now Austin Reaves you saw what he did on Satur the 45 points when he basically had the show to himself so there's weapons around them that could make this work as they continue to play together in blend James hasn't taken a shot yet donish has attempted one on the switch Luc has got the big on him tries the three and hits it the first of many to come for Luka Dage as a Laker here's a former Laker Clarkson started his career in Los Angeles finds markkanen in the Corner three not there Kessler rebounds slapped away out of bounds and touch Last by the jzs Yeah Luka Doncic with his patented three-point shot the way he just Jabs and freezes Defenders particularly bigs out on the perimeter knowing all along he wants to get into that lean back and James pass off the mark trying to hit hachimura in the corner went off his fingertips out of play the only other time that LeBron James and Luka Doncic have played together Allstar teams in fact back when players were captains LeBron three consecutive years picked Luka Doncic for his team at the All-Star game but that's it yeah up until about 5 days ago Luka Doncic would have thought that's the only time he was going to be a teammate of LeBron James was in an All-Star game but instead here we go and you got to think it's under incredibly abnormal circumstances to have a player the caliber of Luka Doncic to move teams in the middle of the season when it's not at his request didn't force his way out didn't leave as a free agent wasn't involved in some sort of a scandal this was a situation where over a period of time the Dallas Mavericks by all accounts seemed like they saw habits that they didn't like necessarily in Luka and they didn't know ultimately if he was going to be able to fully maximize his potential as your franchise leader and lead you to titles and Luka Dage for my money this is one of the most dominant offensive forces this league seen certainly currently in the league and he is now going to welcome this opportunity approv to a lot of people particularly in Dallas what he actually is going to be capable of eight nothing run by the Lakers they have a six-point lead Lakers currently tied for third in the West in the L column as Clarkson misses but he got pushed they'll go to the line for two so the first Doncic James segment about five minutes Doncich three points James hasn't attempted a shot yet the NBA on ESPN is presented all season long by State Farm like a good neighbor State Farm is the LA the Lakers up six early here in the first quarter Lakers general manager Rob pinka called the acquisition of Luka Doncic a seismic event in NBA history the Lakers are certainly no strangers to that when you look at their history of acquisition of players you can go to draft days where they've made trades that eventually led to Kobe Bryant or Magic Johnson via free agency where they landed Shaquille O'Neal or Lebron James the closest one to this would be Kareem Abdul Jabar when he was 27 years old and asked for a trade from Milwaukee to the Lakers over a beef wellington dinner with the owner there in Milwaukee but in this case as you mentioned legs an unprecedented event where the Alice Mavericks have traded a 25-year-old Global Superstar to the Los Angeles Lakers that's a doozy even for this franchise still can't believe I said to you during the break I still can't believe I'm actually watching this happen because of the talent level of Luka Doncic and a George's Point as Lukas passes Off the Mark you think of the the names that in the faces you just saw the Lakers when they get star players it's not just because of their talent it's also because of the Swagger and The Intern how they transcend the game on an international level whether it's what Kobe Bryant did and LeBron James has done many stops along the way here's James on the fade away his first shot of the game Lakers six of eight from the floor two of four from three and they got 18 points in the first six minutes with Doncic on the floor has it knocked Away by Finney Smith another important acquisition by the Lakers made in December and a trade with the Nets James driving on Kesler the shot blocker and James connects over it and one of the things you're going to see with this lineup the cross matches and who you pick up in transition more significant than it's been before because who you could end up with defensively and that time you saw Walker Kessler have to try to guard LeBron James at the top of the key JJ said the switch factor is what he's going to be fascinated to explore with these two players Barson finishes in the lane on that last basket by James Luka Doncic had a huge grin on his face is it to say I've seen that so many times that paidway as an opponent glad I'm seeing it now as a teammate hur's pass almost thrown out of bounds vny Smith Doncic drives Corner three Hachimura no good D there cleaning it up inside for the basket and you saw a couple things on display there first a look away as he got into the air in the paint looked up to the wing knowing he was going to the corner Froze that weak side Defender great work by Vanderbilt on the offensive glass Doncic picking up the foul Smith on the glass that allowed Doncic to end up with this bunny but you see Rui Hachimura is going to end up with a lot of clean looks now even more than he was getting just paired up with LeBron James and Austin Reaves with Luka's ability to see the entire weak side of the floor and deliver the ball on time and with a lot of velocity now Doncic gets the Breather after seven quality minutes in his Laker debut on a minutes restriction but not a significant one again about 30 minutes is the expectation he's 100% healthy just has not played since late December Collins got bumped and it'll go to the line for two yeah I was surprised by the minutes restriction number when we talked with JJ reck before the game to get a feel for that I I assumed he would be particularly coming off the soft tissue injury with such a long layoff but I was thinking maybe in the range of you 20 22 24 minutes and JJ should know about 30 and I'm thinking that's a that's a full night's workload for a lot of guys in this league so the minutes restriction nothing serious and I think that's going to allow Luka to find his rhythm sooner than later playing those kind of minutes right off the bat 13 foul on the Lakers who play the Jazz again Wednesday in Salt Lake City then it's the All-Star break so extra rest then for Doncic he will not be taking part in the All-Star game and then they start the post All-Star break action against the Charlotte Hornet here and you see JJ Reddit getting you know LeBron and Luka out of the game at the same time here early and I think there's probably some of that was due to a lot of energy and adrenaline expended here at the start Collins with the SWAT great save by Markannen it Keyonte George leaves it for Collins for the hammer dunk he's got nine points Utah back within five yeah Keyonte George very talented offensive player nice job right there taking that thing to the rim knowing the trailer was coming the entire time Vincent drills the long two the fact that Gabe Vincent is healthy after missing most of last year with a knee injury you have to think he's going to benefit from having James and Doncic on the floor together Keyonte George with a great pass to mark it step back from RE and you talk about being in the zone Austin Reaves right now saw what he was capable of on Saturday with an increased offensive responsibility and he's already got a couple of them here tonight V with the slam 29 Points with still three and a half minutes to go the Lakers are eight of nine from the floor from inside the ark and three of six from behind the AR Markkanen an inside he's got seven Collins with nine to lead Utah markkanen is a tough cover he does a lot of things for a seven-footer to step out stretch the floor you've already seen them multifaceted hit a three a l threat along the Baseline if you turn your head over play he just converted that dunk and now here on the offensive glass as well mentioned Utah was part of the Doncic trade Jaylen Hood Shapino and a pair of second round picks were involved in the Luka Anthony davis deal another long jumper this one by Vincent for three the fourth triple for the Lakers he's been great really for the last six weeks slow start to the season shooting the ball physically was still trying to find himself he's done that and now he's given JJ reic a very consistent option as a guard on this rotation foul and Finney Smith we got a timeout Lakers up 11 late in the first schedule brought to you by ESPN bet the official sports book of ESPN TN tomorrow night Indiana host the Knicks while Memphis is at Phoenix TNT Thursday the Thunder at Minnesota for more go to nba.com or visit the NBA app Lebron James back on the floor he and Luka Doncic both played seven minutes then James sat for a couple be interesting to see how JJ reck staggers his two stars throughout games good defense by LeBron forcing a turnover yeah one of the keys to the entire thing jtic made sure to make a point anytime this was brought up about the importance of Austin Reaves as another ball handler as you see LeBron really press up defensively with the clock running short Keon George just loses it off his foot but you now have the luxury of having three primary on ball players that can make great decisions including Austin Reaves and it just means you can go 48 minutes you never have to worry about not having one of those on the floor at all times James somehow found Vincent his three is off Target the ti goes though by Goodwin playing just his second game as a Laker recently signed a two-way contract inside two to play in the first the Lakers by 13 they've won six straight games here at home five in a row overall playing as well right now as anybody in pro basketball and that was before the addition of Luka Doncic James drives Vanderbilt trying to save it not sure if that pass was intended for Jaxon Hayes initially I think it was I believe it was and I believe Jaxon Hayes you know is expecting typically in that type of action that that Ball's going to be thrown up as a soft lob LeBron put a little bit extra on that very difficult catch for Jaxon Hayes moving to the rim Lakers shooting 72% from the floor Utah 42% a foul on Kessler on the screen and that's the first on him is Walker Kessler's having a very good year you're talking about a guy that leads the league and field goal perent second in the league in blocks and averaging 17 rebounds a game in the month of February and think about who he's second too for the second straight Year by the way and probably anybody other than Victor Wan is going to be second for a long time because Wy he he aages over four as James hits a three LeBron is off to a great start three of three from the floor looks super energized just his his defensive energy tenacity awareness and communication here early is what I'm watching the vocal leadership on this end is leading to good things on the other end shot clock down to five sense of B had trouble with it now the timer at two good half court defense Again by the Lakers reaching foul though on Vincent with 710 of a second left Lakers over the limit actually got Hayes for the F the foul his first and so free throws for George again LeBron James just suffocating the ball handler in his area you know guy that big laterally that quick strong and I think the Lakers also are going to hope that some of that can also be something visually that Luka Doncic is aware of and the energy that you expend on that end of the floor we know that Luka you know there are things about his game clearly that you know are there that he has to try to address and always be better they're they're paying off here on his offensive talent but a guy like LeBron James and his type of leadership on this end to doing this you know past the age of 40 and expend this much energy defensively could be something that's a good example for Luka hay in the high post nice pass by James the three not there though for Vincent loose ball Tracked Down by goodwi who saves it before he crashes into the front row 9sec difference in the clocks here's Vanderbilt his three not close Utah can hold for the final shot Vanderbilt playing just his eighth game of the season for the Lakers been dealing with injuries Collier tried to lob it and it was rejected by Hayes James in the open floor drives all the way can't finish though and then a loose ball foul and Vanderbilt so Utah is going to get free throws with nine1 of a second left really nice job by Jaxon Hayes that time breaking off that lob it looked like the backside was open there for Utah and then LeBron surprised at himself that he did not convert this he had to jump in the air and sort of contort his body put a little too much English on it but here you see Jaxon Hayes yeah has the anchor they try to throw that lob to Kessler Jaxon Hayes breaks it up sends LeBron the other way yeah James still making his point could he thought he was fouled on the drive but mik a Potter is at the foul line 30-year Pro out of Wisconsin playing his 24th game of the season a pretty good debut though for James and Doncic together the Lakers 37 points in the quarter 64% shooting from the floor five of 11 from three and the first quarter comes to a close a 12-point lead for the Lakers trying to run their win streak to six in a row Luka Don's first basket as an LA Laker was a three he's got five points and an assist in his first seven minutes for La a Monday presented by state farmer here with John Collins of the Utah Jazz down 12 what can you guys do better to get going uh just manage the energy uh a lot of it in here tonight and uh we just got to do it a good job of managing the game not letting them uh get a lot of fast breaks and take control with Doncic and James how do you try to limit their effectiveness when they're together on the floor man just try to make everybody else score and and have them be as least effective as we can those guys are great Playmakers so um it's on us to just talk and and St together John good luck thank you thanks guys back to you and George everybody else did score but so did James and Doncic and that's why they have 37 points Collins leads all scores though with nine fou 2im R Hachimura picking up the foul as second personal Doncic seven first quarter minutes two of three from the floor one of two from three third foul actually on Hachimura so see how JJ reic substitutes for him or whether he keeps him on the floor that's not a good call JJ might make an adjustment here I believe Luka was going to come in probably in about 2 or 3 minutes for Goodwin most likely but now the foul trouble with hachimura might change how he utilizes Luka in this first half and this lineup with hore at the five will'll be interesting to see how much of this we see the Lakers made as we mentioned at the top of the show what they thought was another trait right before the deadline and an important trait Mark Williams a center from the Charlotte Hornets as Reaves Banks it in that trade got rescinded so Dalton Knecht who was part of that deal he's back tonight and he he got in late last night so he's not going to play but he's on the bench and expected to play minutes for the Lakers going forward George has more on that Dave legs our own sham shiran our NBA Insider is reporting the Charlotte Hornets have been in contact with the NBA as they explore options to dispute the Los Angeles Lakers failed physical assessment of Mark Williams sources tell ESPN the Williams Dalton Knecht trade was next Saturday as you guys just mentioned and uh the hornet are weighing Avenues to challenge interesting we we knew the Lakers were thin up front we knew they were going to try to address it at the trading deadline thought they had now obviously everything's sort of in limbo you see dton connect sitting there was not going to play tonight JJ re said didn't think it was fair to him to come back under these circumstances got in very late last night so decided to let his head sort of gather itself as he watches this and figure out exactly what's going to happen with kect going forward James looking to take Kessler off the bounce Falling Away connects again over one of the top shot blockers in the NBA we've seen that twice in this game James with 11 points already kickball going to stay with Utah yeah LeBron getting into this fade game early three of these already in the first half he's hit just gets to his spot the one-legged lean back and I think there's somebody in attendance named Dirk nitzki who probably could appreciate that one-legged fallback jumper very much Dirk started it and everybody followed it is interesting that Dirk nitzki is here at a Laker game supporting the Lakers although really he's here supporting Luka Doncic his former teammate Dirk's career was ending in Dallas as Lukas was just getting started Austin Reed picking up the foul his first and the second on the Lakers and Dirk's actually here with Luka's dad they're sitting next to each other a few rows behind us Collins hits the first free throw three of three from the floor 10 points there's Sasha Luka's dad there in the sweater and you can see Dirk there as well left of your screen second free throw no good the push back offt Target and James out of there with it racing up the floor but need some help had to wait for his teammates to get set Lakers by 14 two minutes gone by GES driving bumped and we shoot two with colins picking up the foul yeah one of the benefits of this will be for Austin Reaves in that he now will get a lot of times when particularly when they're playing together and luuka eventually here's going to check back into the game we'll probably see some more minutes with the three of them out there together he now can benefit at times from the third best perimeter Defender being on him for stretches and he's got a handle he draws fouls and so that's going to be something that he is going to welcome that he doesn't have to necessarily get that that second level guy that can get up in him as the Lakers only other ball handler prior to Luka's arrival Austin Reaves four of four at the line tonight and 44 for his last 45 at the free throw line and that's only in a four plus less than a half game so he's getting here almost 10 times a night in this stretch and converting every time that's the part of his game that probably not enough people talk about is just how good he is at finding driving Lanes getting to the basket and then ultimately getting to the free throw line James Long three pin balls out to Hachimura and the 15ot foot back off the heel Collins threw it right to goodwi one as he is falling down trying to hit his teammate Coler instead turned it over and it led to an easy basket yeah just tough break for Collins lost his balance as he was going to the ground after they clearly had secured the rebound ends up with two easy ones for the Lakers and a goodwi lost his mask wearing a mask to protect the facial injury had to take it off there so playing without it James no look down Court Hachimura lost it and now Collier ahead of the pack goes in for the easy layup 11 points for Utah off of Laker turnovers Collier was bronny james' teammate at USC last year ronne out tonight good one in the lane with a push shot Jazz have this unique mixture of veteran players along with a bunch of young guys that they're trying to develop and will hardy was just raving about Isaiah Collier and the way he has played over the last month yeah really grown in terms of his decision making made a good pass there Johnny Juzang will play collegially here after growing up in La played for UCLA he missed the three Finney Smith's three no good but a second chance opportunity and Reaves got shoved as he was trying to fight through a double team Luka talking with Justin vany thought foul should have been called earlier so they're going to stagger James and Doncic minutes here LeBron was out there for about 6 minutes without Doncic and now Luka will play without LeBron well you think about the way this is going to break down the start of the game is going to be 6 s minutes together the start of the second half will be 6 s minutes together and the end of the game on most nights uh depending on the score will be the last 6 seven minutes that's 20 minutes roughly together right there and now reick has the luxury of Staggering these guys and making sure you always have someone that can set the table for everybody on the floor Juzang picked up the foul as second we asked JJ reck who played with Luka Doncic four years ago for about 20 games in Dallas where have you seen Luka grow the most he said everywhere but when he's willing he's been a much better Defender than he was early on in his career free ball from Hur is good to beat the shot clock buzzer and I think Luka Doncic is the best in this league at the late find after he's exhausted opportunities on a drive at The Rim his ability to then pick you apart from that position under the basket is really unique and you saw have benefit from that right there two assists for Doncic to go with five points in his first ever game as a Laker now we got a Jaxon Hayes foul two on him you know he gets the switch so he's going to go downhill against markkanen in and you see him jump in the air but realizes he's defended well and that's the great thing about the vision the size and the strength his ability to get the ball to the weak side of the floor at any angle to let weak side Shooters spot up and still do damage late in the clock didn't make all NBA his rookie year but since five can second and first team all NBA selections for Luka Doncic won't be eligible for the awards even if he plays every game the rest of the way missed too many games won't hit that 65 game mark Doncic on the step back and drill the three and and cleared by Collins pass from Coler went through the legs of Collins here's Hachimura in transition and he's hacked by markkanen first on Markkanenan and the 14 foul on Utah the lead is 21 for the Lakers Midway through the second quarter not after review after review marketing gets to a legal spot and jumps vertically therefore there is no foul on the play The Challenge is successful at the time of the whistle Utah had imminent possession of the ball therefore it'll be their ball in the sideline with 24 seconds on the shot clock the since this is a mandatory timeout the Lakers are still charged with the timeout so successful ch for Will Hardy who who's an excellent young coach and and obviously Utah is going through a rebuilding phase and it seems like the the Brain Trust of the Utah Jazz feels very good about Will Hardy leading that next chapter in jazz history once they get through this this rough patch one of the Bright Young Minds in the game and you know he's in a tough position right now as any coach would be with a franchise in the NBA that's clearly in rebuild but will hardy is hopefully going to be that guy for them once they get past that point and they they get to the other side of this rebuild which they're playing the long game right now for sure a lot of picks over the next seven years 11 first round picks in the next seven years this is the option they're going to take and will hardy could be the guy to lead them so Doncic does the Dirk with Durk in attendance after LeBron just did it couple of minutes ago that one foot Fade Away Doncic now with seven points Juzang three no good lead is 214 La now in the switch Doncic fires to Finney Smith they were teammates for a few years in Dallas Aura driving and finishing off CL you saw all the space that was available on the weak side that's all because of Luka's presence operating ball screen on the left side of the Court three players shift to that side gets it to the other side quickly and then there's opportunities for hat to find a driving lane I mean obviously we know Luka Doncic a brilliant scorer but his IQ teamed with the incredible basketball IQ we've seen over 22 years of LeBron James here's D for three it's so rare to have a tandem like that together has LeBron played with anybody with all the great legendary teammates he's played with that's that's similar to Luka he's had great great teammates Hall of Famers uh but really more as complimentary players to him this is a little bit of a different situation because because of the style of game and the ball uses for Luka Doncic Hachimura trying to put it on the deck and get get past Clarkson and a foul called on the Jazz fourth team foul and one of the great luxuries will be late game situations and I think how fresh LeBron and Luka both could be because of some of that responsibility over the first 44 45 minutes of the game being shared a little bit more equally certainly Luka didn't have that luxury in Dallas at any time and now they can play off each other you see Luka again with a nice burst on the receive getting to the other side of the rim that's nine points now for Doncic and you look at the timing of this move the Lakers are right in the thick of things in the west they're tied for third in the Lost column and they're 18- seven in their last 25 games best record during that Stretch A lot of people curious if they can compete this year Doncic with the jab step now fires can't drill the three he's one for five from deep and he could be streaky from the three-point line as it is after this long layoff I think that will be the last thing to come for Luka the consistency from out there Hachimura but not a smart foul that is four on him they'll have to go to the bench you would imagine for the remainder of the half so again you look at the L column they're tied with Denver fourth third just two games out of the two spot and look Oklahoma City's a great team but we haven't seen them Advance beyond the second round of the playoffs with with a very young group no doubt it does feel different this year and their offseason acquisitions in Oklahoma City just give them so much more size and depth and their defense is Elite so right now they're still the standard I think in the Western Conference but you're right this this changes I think the feel around the Lakers and and the potential upside of a deep postseason run Doncic with the Mavs beat Oklahoma City last year in the conference semis as Luka LED along with Kyrie Irving Dallas to the NBA finals for the first time since 2011 when they won the championship and it beat LeBron James in the Miami Heat so Doncic and James on the floor together here likely to close out the first half Doncic puts it on the floor leans in gives it up to Vincent shot clock at three James returns it Vincent the three ball that is the seventh triple for the Lakers what a f by LeBron goes down the left side of the lane knowing Vincent was all the way over on the right wing marks inside no Hayes rebounds quick outl James looking to push Finney Smith fouled by markkanen in that will put Utah over the limit and Finney Smith will go to the line Lakers up 21 late in the first half Luka with nine James with 11 NBA Wednesday as a double header starting with Boston in San Antonio at s eastern time then Lukas former team the Dallas Mavericks facing the Golden State Warriors NBA Countdown tips us off at Eastern Anthony Davis got off to a great start had a huge night for Dallas yesterday before two days ago before the injury looking at LeBron's teammates Through The Years won two championships in Miami with Dwayne Wade went to the finals four consecutive years won a title with Kyrie Irving obviously made it to a couple other finals losing to Golden State Anthony Davis they won a championship in the bubble and now Luka Doncic night one of a new era in Los Angeles three great great players that you just listed and Dwayne ra fact a Finals MVP and a champion prior to LeBron's arrival in Miami but there was never a doubt with all of those guys paired with LeBron who was in control LeBron was in control of everything they did offensively and Luka obviously has been that his entire career that's why this pairing is so unique in so many ways because of their ability to beat you at as scorers as primary bar inlanders or as guys that can pick you apart from all over the floor George has more Dave legs I covered those heedles Team every night Road and home legs I will say this we do remember there was that tough start remember they were nine and8 to start that season and it felt like those guys were taking turns now after that they won 21- 22 but it really wasn't until that off season after they lost to Dallas that Dwayne and LeBron had an infamous trip to the Bahamas where they talked about if they were going to succeed and reach their goals it needed to be LeBron's team but that first year was not as easy as I think some people may remember kind of now at this stage you know 15 years later and what's so unique about this situation you know Wade and LeBron and Bosch they were contemporaries think about this Luka Donic is 15 years younger than LeBron James you've got a guy still playing at an incredible level at his age but how much longer can LeBron possibly go so what does that mean for the final stages of his career now playing with a new Superstar so significant that they overlap here you're talking about the greatest player of of the last two decades now paired with a guy that potentially is going to be one of the greatest players of the next decade for the Lakers uh so it is it is really unprecedented as I said at the start guys of Luka Don's ability just don't become available at this stage of their career been such a buzz even on Saturday when there was talk that maybe Doncic would play but sat out the the entire city has been anticipating this very night and it was packed about an hour before the game everybody watching Luka warm up James has it knocked Away by Collins Markkanen and in transition lovs it up there for Kessler couple of seven Footers getting out of the open floor for Utah connecting on that Lop Vinnie Smith driving gets it back and scores off the window Lakers currently 12 games above 500 the last time they were 13 over 500 was 2021 four years since they were this good as James trying to get out on Clarkson gives up a three Lakers go to a little Zone look right there and just didn't really have the backline Defenders spread enough too much space in the corner give up the open three Doncic leans in foul it won't fall but Luka will go to the line for his first free throws as a Laker Clarkson picks up his second foul Doncic the scoring champ a year ago at 34 points per game his career scoring average is 29 that's third all time behind Michael Will Chamberlain only Michael has scored more points per game in NBA playoff history Doncic historically in 50 career playoff games has been even better in the postseason than the regular season shooting for the perfect gift this Valentine's Day give 12 months of live games with League Pass now 30% off through February 16th I think the George's Point earlier too which was really good you know the beginning here now tonight doesn't look like we're headed there we'll see what Utah can muser in the second half but I thought Dwayne way LeBron James when they first got paired when you saw some issues early and they were overly deferential to each other in a lot of ways and that is something that a guy like Luka Doncic is going to feel a little bit playing alongside a presence like LeBron Markkanen in's three not there Doncic fires down cour to James in stride it rolls around and drops what a look by Luka a LeBron 13 points for James three assists for Doncic that's a two-hand chest pass to traveled roughly 70 plus feet in the air on a rope and put it in the only place Leon could get that 69 first half points for the Lakers Clarkson won't fall from D battered around and out of bounds off the Jabs about a 4se second difference in the game in shot clocks yeah Luka turns immediately see his eyes look up the floor and then this is put perfectly to the right side of the lane where LeBron was cutting and just past the outstretched arm to the defender Doncic on the switch has Walker Kessler on him Luka penetrates puts it up missed the shot tracking it down as Reaves 4 seconds to go in the half BR for three 72 points for La in the first half Lakers shoot 60% from the floor on a night that oh nine days ago would have seen unfathomable but here we are Luka Doncic is indeed a Laker he scores 11 points three assists three rebounds in his first half with his new teammate LeBron James stay tuned for halftime presented by Hyundai with Malika CH and Udonis Haslam after these messages James and Doncic combined for 24 points the Lakers put up 72 as a team and they lead by 25 at halftime Laker debut a success through one half 72 points and they lead the Utah Jazz by 25 Dave Pash Tim legler will check in with George Sano here in a little bit for Luka Doncic really the expectations were to be great and he was pretty darn good given that this is his first game in 6 weeks we forget he's coming off of an injury as we look at crunch time brought to you by Popeyes yeah fairly seamless and he has the LA Vibe going right there coming in you know he had that rocking incredible reception at the start as you would expect the electricity in this building for a half hour before the game was incredible and then came out and showed you what he's capable of gets to that first three and then little work in the post the vision theil to deliver the ball LeBron James benefiting there's going to be some rough patches as they sort through this but I think all things considered pretty good start to the new era for the Lakers Doncic 11 points three assists he was one of five from three James six of eight very efficient again 13 points George has more Dave legs LeBron James was adamant in the Huddle to Luka Doncic before the game he said Luka be you don't f in fit the bleep out is what he said be yourself and we've certainly seen that today so no one trying to be differential out here Dave everyone's trying to get their own game going and there were so many people as do just throws out of their L to Jaxon Hayes so many people were curious how it would look with the two on the floor together did it meet your expectation legs of what you thought oh I think it did but you're talking about you know barely scratching the surface of what this ultimately could be I I was thinking Luka has this ability as a raw scorer to just completely take over games it was difficult in Dallas at times because he also had to set the table for everybody else here he has another guy that can do that when he goes into scoring mode Doncic hurt his cap on Christmas day as a member of the Dallas Mavericks and he had missed the first three games that uh since the trade from the map of the Lakers due to that cap injury on a minute's restriction so to speak going to play about 30 minutes tonight another dump from Hayes that time the lot by LeBron but Luka started that one with the hockey assist the opportunities for Jaxon Hayes are just going to be significantly easier uh just run the floor and now you have two different options handling the ball to hit you from either side that time they both touched it on that break three no good batt it out to James LeBron looking to run going downhill attacking Markkanen it nice recovery as markkanen gets the swap an All-Star and the most improved player in the NBA two years ago Doncic commits a foul his second personal eight days ago Nico Harrison and Rob pinka who had behind the scenes been talking shocked the Sports World surprising And consequential Trades not just in NBA history but American Sports history behind closed doors unbeknownst to just about everybody including seemingly Danny a and the Utah Jazz there were reports that even though the Jazz were part of the trade that they actually didn't know the pieces that were involved in terms of the big names as Doncic scores and one and here we are it's finally reality Lukas first game is a Laker he's got 13 and a chance and a three-point play yeah this is what we always talk about with Lua Luka the deceleration as you get deep into the paint few guys are as patient as he is and he's got the size and strength to then play through contact but he doesn't really release the ball around the rim until he is absolutely ready and just as he's getting healthy his former team is starting to deal with injuries we mentioned Anthony Davis in his first game as a Maverick was brilliant until he went down with an adductor injury expected to miss several weeks tonight Daniel Gafford injured and did not return to the game after suffering a leg injury Derek Lively is out as well so the MAV is dealing with all kinds of injuries as markkanen connects from mid-range we'll see the Mavs on Wednesday night they'll take on Golden State they're in the play in right now the Lakers are currently tied for third in the West they've been in the play in the last two years but they're four games removed from that right now Collier nice speed and the slam from Kesler saw the burst there by klier this is what they really like about him his ability to make plays off the dribble you see the the find at The Rim his Natural Instincts for facilitating are something that will hardy was really pleased with Doncic couldn't make that as he was Falling Towards the Baseline trying to finish through contact pull up three from Clarkson the former Laker who is a member of the first team all rookie Squad when he was here in La back in 2015 barks has 11 points tonight former sixthman of the year with Utah back in 2021 Lakers play one more game before the break in Utah on Wednesday as markkanen in scores and then out of the All-Star break the Lakers will take on the Hornets they're 31 and 19 right now James for three LeBron James with 16 points effortless getting up into that shot for LeBron you knew that was good as soon as you let it go it just had perfect rotation and arc on that shot he's 13 for his last 23 from behind the arc yeah he's more com comfortable with this shot than he's ever been throughout his career comes up rejects the screen by Jaxon Hayes and just decides to go ahead and operate with enough space knowing he can get that off clearly feeling in Rhythm six for nine now from the field seven for 10 make that with that shot his last game legs had a season eye 42 points against the Warriors becoming the oldest player 40 years old Michael was a about a month younger when he did it at 40 years of age the oldest player to get 40 LeBron happens also be the youngest player ever to get 40 points did it late in his rookie season back in March of 2004 plenty of 40-point games in between as well we should add for James that pass broken up and the fourth turnover by LeBron and then he commits a foul and to your point I mean the way he looks there's no telling how much longer LeBron's going to play it's only going to be up to him as good as he looks as dominant as athletic but now you have the situation where this trade was made not only to take into consideration the rest of LeBron James career however long that is it's it's the next decade potentially for the Lakers and that was something they were organizationally wondering about what was going to be the next iteration of the LA Lakers after LeBron James retired and James keeps looking at his left hand and so there were some blood on his left thumb so while we have a moment let's remind you about our upcoming National TV schedule on TNT tomorrow night the Knicks third in the East are at the Pacers Memphis is in Phoenix the Grizzlies currently are two games ahead of Denver and the Lakers for the number two spot in the west TNT Thursday the Thunder the best record in the west at 42-9 taking on Minnesota for more go to nba.com or visit the NBA app Shay gilis Alexander right now now the front runner for MVP about 30 games left in the regular season we are two months away from the playoffs just a few days away from the All-Star break LeBron James this weekend in San Francisco will play in an NBA record 21st allstar game offensive foul on Utah Luka that time takes this elbow right there right to the nose isah codli trying to swing through and split that Gap there between two Defenders and Luka takes the worst for that second foul on Isaiah Collier Doncic finds James Hachimura Corner three it's good Hachimura with his second three 8556 LA Lakers trying to win their six straight 10 out of 11 air ball from Clarkson Doncic quickly ahead but the deflection it still gets to LeBron downhill scoid score with the left off the window yeah markkanen didn't got him once on a semi break away that time LeBron crafty with the left hand 18 for James the average is about 25 per game d just trying to hang with Markkanen it LeBron comes over for the double gets the deflection forces a turnover James again and a foul on Collier is third James will shoot two when we come back it'll be his first free throws of the night James with 18 points yeah how long have we been watching this LeBron James out in the open floor nobody is going to stop this man from getting to the rim whenever he wants welcome back to LA the Lakers up big here in the third quarter we all know that the LA wildfires have displaced so many families and so many businesses are no longer at the moment and Luka Doncic who just arrived here in Los Angeles has put out a press release today acknowledging that his foundation will be donating $500,000 for the immediate recovery for the LA wildfires and he's committed to helping rebuild courts playgrounds and Fields that were destroyed during those wildfires to help kids get back on those fields in those courts he signed it by saying to everyone affected by these fires we're here to help now and for the long haul your new neighbor Luka Dave yeah I love that new neighbor and no surprise Luka was very involved in the Dallas Community a big reason why there's so much backlash there not just because he's a great player but also his involvement in the DFW area as James three is Off the Mark aim Aura there with a put back yeah I think with Luka it was obviously the production on the court it was also the entertainment value right the entertainment Factor every night that you watched it and then in addition everything he was doing in the community uh no wonder why people in Dallas are hurting over over losing a star player that seemingly was just getting ready to start his prime years if you're a Maverick fan and many of them are upset right now about the trade now you don't have Anthony Davis you've got other injuries How concerned are you because all the talk there is they felt they could make a run at an NBA title this year and that's why they made the deal as markkanen and the dun transition yeah listen that's going to be difficult they're going to depending on how long this lasts how big a hole they find themselves in in Western Conference to come from those slots where Dallas is probably going to find themselves very difficult uphill battle in the postseason three-pointer from Clarkson his third triple he's got 14 points there's still an awful lot of talent in Dallas got Kyrie Irving Anthony Davis you add Klay Thompson you got role players you got some guys that went to the finals a year ago on that roster but you know what Luka Doncic represents is just so unique and so special D for three no good Luka won for six from three he's got 14 points five assists five rebounds Kyrie Irving just named an Allstar replacement for Anthony Davis by the way the more I think about it with the Lakers what's going to be fascinating at times is just to watch the dynamic where Luka gets into these scoring runs and he doesn't have to worry as much about setting the table for other people at that point that's going to be fascin he never had that luxury in Dallas good job on the glass that time by Kessler working hard and finishing third year out of Auburn career high points and rebounds and second in the NBA in blocks for the second straight year N9 nothing Utah run and you see the Lakers running a lot of two-man action with two ball haers setting streams for each other to get switches they can just attack and that's your fiveman right now Rui Hachimura more as the Lakers go small hitting another three and I think you'll see a lot of that out of the Lakers particularly since they didn't get an additional Center at the deadline you're going to see Jaxon Hayes starting but you're going to see this smaller lineup I think a lot defensively and potentially to close games because how difficult it is to match up with this on this end of the Flor but as George mentioned earlier talking about that Shams report maybe more to come with the the Mark Williams trade that was rescinded Williams back and Charlotte D connect cam reddish back with the Lakers a lot more information to come on that because it's clearly Charlotte was surprised by Mark Williams coming out here and failing that physical the Lakers probably surprised as well so there's there's more coming there and there's obviously more now to come from dton connect we got to see what exactly his situation will be going forward was was playing well for a rookie was clearly became one of the crowd favorites here and now he finds himself in a pretty awkward situation Doncic his 24th minute supposed to play about 30 couldn't bank that one in again his first game in six weeks not played since Christmas due to a calf injury why he did not make his Laker debut until tonight was listed as questionable originally on the injury report upgraded to probable this morning foul here in Jaxon Hayes three on him four on the Lakers and you know Dave you mentioned like the smaller lineups defensively that benefits Luka Doncic because there are going to be matchups you can find for him particularly at the three or the four spot where maybe he is guarding someone that's not as apt to try to take him off the dribble or use their quickness against him that is a benefit for the Lakers to to play small you've got guys like Dorian Finney Smith you've got Rui hachimura you got LeBron you've got some guys with great reach and strength so if you want to go small I think it's an option for JJ reic defensively and it's interesting you say that you know JJ well s away from working with him all these well not all these years a few years at ESPN but one of the things JJ loves is problem solving that's one of the reasons he took the coaching job to to continue to challenge himself in that thing that he loves so much about solving problems well it's a good problem when you're trying to figure out how to make these lineups work with two future Hall of Famers Lukas three not there he's one for seven from behind the ark 14 points still Clarkson not sh gets the offensive rebound but then goes out of bounds to La it is a challenge though for a rookie coach to try to figure that all out as Doncic will sit played nine minutes here in this third quarter yeah JJ reck's dining room table the salt and pepper shakers are never safe when he's sitting down the number of things he's going to use to draw up play while he's eating dinner that's just the way JJ's mind is and when you put this many weapons at his disposal that creativity is really going to come out the longer there're together VY Smith for three short rebound sens Wonder at this stage with it being a 24-point game do we even see James and Doncic again Markkanen and misses obviously you want to get Luka back in the swing of playing five on five NBA basketball but got the allstar break coming up game Wednesday Salt Lake will see if Lukas's night is over 24 minutes 14 points big Le big lead for the Lakers late in the third some of the most significant trades in Los Angeles sports history obviously you start with Kareem Abdul Jabar and what he end up doing with the Lakers Wayne Gretzky after winning four Stanley Cups goes from Edmonton to the Kings they go to a Stanley Cup mookie vs comes to the Dodgers they win two World Series at the time people didn't think much of the Goff Stafford trade but then Matthew Stafford after Goff got them to a Super Bowl Stafford gets them a ring and now you got Luka Doncic making his Laker debut tonight in 24 minutes 14 points five rebounds and four assists one time you the expect expectations for the Lakers I think coming in in the Western Conference I don't think people were considering them to be a contender coming into the season when you looked at the landscape the top of the Western Conference started playing really good basketball prior to the trade they cont continued it through the trade nine out of their last 10 and now you add Luka to the mix they look at the West now and and I think they believe they might be able to put a product on the floor that's so unique and so different with their ability to attack def defenses that they can make a significant run this year with a win theight they'd be 32 and 19 13 games over 500 for the first time in four years keante George at the line shooting to by the way there was a foul and sense ofall in Utah that was challenged by Will Hardy was an unsuccessful challenge that's why you saw the Lakers shooting free throws a moment ago take a look at our double header for you on Wednesday here on ESPN Boston which currently has the second best record in the East taking on San Antonio was a huge night for Victor wanyama you can see all the highlights on Sports Center then you got the Warriors they won again tonight so so far so good with Jimmy Butler we already touched down the struggles of Dallas uh with a loss tonight but also the injuries Anthony Davis included no Daniel Gafford Going Down Sports Collier will have more on that as well nearing two minutes to go here in the third 24-point lead for the Lakers here's James spot up three no good James 19 points out of bounds to Utah saw Jared Vanderbilt working on the glass right there you know with Anthony Davis leaving Jared Vanderbilt actually beomes their second leading rebounder behind LeBron James and he only plays 15 minutes a night his rebounds per minute numbers are insane and he's an underrated piece of this Laker roster just hasn't been available he's hurt most of the last year hurt for almost entirely this season playing just his eighth game gives him defensive capability up the floor with sze which is not something they really have if Jared Vanderbilt's not available to him but you think of the L as James drills a three that even if the Lakers have a smaller lineup they got guys with tremendous wingspans including Vanderbilt Collins tried to finish there and couldn't he's still down gets from an official Haze in transition catches another alley and dunks it yeah was spectacular effort by John need to get his hands on that pass it was so high up by the top of the square but when he fell took himself out of the play the Lakers were Off to the Races and they're a very selective team about running he six of six from the floor almost all of those made shots on ALU dunks Collins turns it over here's James who has eight assists now after that last helper that lob throwing out of bounds got a handful of turnovers though J heretic thought that was deflected so he's going to challenge that ruling he didn't even look to the bench at all he he saw it himself and said I'm going to challenge that back in a moment last the Lakers have called timeout to challenge the ruling of out of bounds awarded to Utah what I so the Lakers challenging the call on the floor that it was off LeBron James and not deflected by Kessler it did not look like Kessler touched that it's actually filipowski filipowski sorry I believe but he you're right it doesn't look like the ball really changed it's probably be the best look at it right here after that's over his fingers the ball is last touched by LeBron James therefore the challenge is unsuccessful play will resume with Utah on the Baseline the game clock will be reset to 44.7 seconds since the challenge is unsuccessful the Lakers will be charged a timeout and they have no challenges remaining for the rest of the game JJ just did that himself too he didn't even look back at the bench he thought it was deflected and he's laughing about that because the guys behind the bench are saying hey man check in over here next time I think JJ just looked at it like I can't take it home with me I might as well use it that's the seventh turnover by James he also has seven rebounds eight assists and 22 points now a Utah turn over over and back will Hardy's out of challenges even if his players want him to challenge they don't have one already used two was successful on the first one giving him a second one you know and now the Lakers you know they're going to get a very small sample here with Luka before the All-Star break and and then he's got to Sprint to the finish with with fresh legs it's one of the benefits of having an injury actually for an extended period of time you def feel fresh and energized when you come back for that Sprint and then through the playoffs George with the layup after the Miss by James from three two second difference of the game in shot clocks the man defending LeBron James played with james' son at USC last year Isaiah Collier Vincent with four to shoot tries the three as the buzzer was about to sound and that ends the third quarter the Lakers take a 25-point lead to the fourth NBA All-Star Weekend begins Friday in San Francisco with the celebrity game on ESPN Barry Bonds and Jerry Rice are the head coaches our coverage begins from Oakland Arena at 7 eastern time all the stars are out tonight ticket PR skyrocketed reportedly went up 500% as the day went on from when Luka Doncic was upgraded from questionable to probable here's James downhill missed the shot got it back and scores he's got 24 Doncic with 14 we don't know if we'll see Luka again with this 27-point lead 24 minutes played for Doncic in his Lakers debut Kessler cides with James and they're going to call a blocking foul on LeBron and I think if the game had stayed closer I think the plan probably would have been for Luka to be at about 20 to 22 minutes heading into the fourth quarter in case you needed to finish with a particular lineup get him six seven minutes there and there's your 28 to 30 which is what I think they want him to be at the fact that he's already at 24 uh in a 25-point game I I think it's unlikely we would see Luka again first game for him since December 25th traded just over a week ago with Markieff Markieff Morris and Maxi Kleber who's out with an injury is James will go to the bench Anthony Davis Max Christie a first round pick sent to Dallas Utah was involved in that trade needed a 13 to make it happen tesler gets the free throw Utah had beaten Golden State Orlando and sent a game against Phoenix to overtime all in the last week but getting hammered here tonight yeah two franchises in totally different stages Lakers very much in a win now mode and now potentially took care of the future as well whereas you tell it's it's all about Player Development this point and you do have a mixture of some veteran guys in there that are good players so this is The Balancing Act that will Hardy has every single night which is not easy I don't know if James shaken up just stretching perhaps after and playing only about a minute here in the fourth check in with George Dave Dave Dave go ahead George Dave legs sorry my mic wasn't on uh I was watching LeBron as he walked off the floor he went right up to his trainer Mike mancias and was grabbing kind of his midsection a little bit after that collision with Walker Kesler and went back to the locker room as you saw in that area so I'll keep an eye on what's going on there but that's what I observed as he walked towards the bench he's been battling an ankle issue throughout the year it's been sore off and on he didn't play on Saturday obviously that's not the problem here Lakers play one more game before the All-Star break Wednesday in Salt Lake and then James will be in the All-Star game for a record 21st time he's on team sha and he'll be teammates with Anthony Davis Turn Around jumper Hachimura and no good and call your rebounds pull up three by Keon George not close ball battered around Juzang has it George will try again same spot same result tesler offensive rebound and he's fouled he's got 11 points and 11 rebounds in this game mentioned those monster rebounding numbers he's been putting up and Utah fourth overall in rebound percentage it's one of the strengths of their team not a great shooting team leads to Opportunities like that on the offensive glass but you see another 12 rebounds tonight for Walker Kessler and he has averaged 17 rebounds a game in February in addition to almost 13 points you were touching earlier on the different stages of where these two franchises are for Utah a team that's used to winning they were in the playoffs six straight years but now it's three consecutive Seasons where theyve missed it they're in this rebuilding phase but they also have a Collier piece with Lauri markkanen who's still a young guy he's going to be here he signed a a contract but a lot of faces that I think there's uncertainties going forward as to whether a lot of these guys currently in the roster are going to be here no doubt they've got three guys you know that have another year on their contract that will free up potentially $70 million of cap space I mentioned earlier all of the first round picks that they have markkanen and his resigned and this is a guy that averaged over 20 points a game the last two seasons he's at 19 this year but now they're very much in flux about what they want to do who they want to keep a lot of nights these are guys really auditioning for a place in the franchise going forward that was a terrible alleyoop attempt by George thrown way over the head of a teammate out of bounds now Cody Williams who they had several first round picks but Cody Williams who was the highest number 10 overall he's struggled when he's been on the floor but he's also battled injury played in just 27 games this year in averaging about four points per game 21 points now for Rui Hachimura he's the second leading score for the Lakers in this game he scored over 24 out of his last five games he's at 19 again tonight and he he just has become incredibly lethal from that 18t area Corner three Vincent good Vincent with his second make that third three-pointer and he's got 11 points his confidence is back struggled last year was three of 28 from three around 35% this year Steel by Reaves fakes the lob and takes it himself to the layup and a timeout by Utah tough decision for a Defender you see Austin Reaves taking advantage of it if you commit to the ball hander you get a lob over your head if you don't it's two easy ones for Austin Reaves the NBA on ESPN is presented all season long by State Farm like a good neighbor SC fan pel we're getting set for Sports Center here in the nation's capital we'll have live reaction to Luka's Laker debut we'll hear from JJ reck also highlights of a busy night in the NBA Steph Curry Jimmy Butler and the Warriors beat the Bucks in Milwaukee the Cavs get the best of Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolf Stanford Steve here with the bad beats we'll see you when this game is over back to LA passion leg all right it's Gott Lakers by 30 they've led by as many as 34 in this game it appears Luka Don's debut is complete just under 24 minutes played 14 points five rebounds four assists has not played here in the fourth quarter and you know the shooting was really what wasn't there to make 1 for seven from three or he has a much bigger offensive night as Austin Reaves shows you a little what he's got with the handle tremendous head fake get the defender in the air and play through it for and one 21 points for Austin Reaves after a 45-point game Saturday James back on the Laker bench George mentioned ear leard was uh stretching out after that collision with Kessler Austin Reaves now 47 for 48 from the line in the last five games he's taken his game to another level this year career-high and scoring also a six assist per game guy this year Markkanen and can't put it home Reaves with the rebound Reaves is eight rebounds tonight as well as 22 points here's Finney Smith short on the three Juzang swishes that three-pointer through the net he's got three triples in the game yeah he can do that he's got 40% on the year from three that's what he's out there to do space the floor catch and shoot quick release like based on what you saw tonight again I get it's just a snapshot was there anything in the 23 minutes that Luka played and about 16 minutes of those were with James that surprised you or was it what you expected in general with the two of them on the floor together it it was what I expected it was just a small taste of it but I saw opportunities in each half where they they were able to run action on one side of the floor with one of these elite players draw Defenders to that side of the floor reverse it to the other side side and then have much more space to operate on the opposite side for one of those two guys that is really where this can become very difficult to defend the more they find that Rhythm and then you mix Austin Reaves into that as well when he's out there so I did see some of that action and JJ reck was talking about that before the game that's where his mind starts spinning of the opportunities and possibilities of what you can do offensively you have 31 games left after tonight to continue to figure out how much you play the two guys together how much do you stag of them and the officials are at the monitor after the made basket by Collins looking to see if the personal foul was actually a flagrant foul on the close out a quick look after review Jameson closes out recklessly which causes the shooter to land on his foot there's a high potential for injury here therefore the play has been upgraded to a flagrant foul penalty one since the basket was successful they'll get two free throws to make one shot and Utah will retain possession of the ball with 24 on the shot clock Trey jimson's first minute of the game and he commits a flagrant foul yeah and the reason they use the word recklessly you can see his his right leg just swings forward and just completely eats up the landing area for John Collins as a shooter I can tell you this was one of the rules when this went into effect uh I was heavily in favor of protect that Landing space for Shooters and and Jon's a little bit surprised by that certainly nothing intentional there but you just saw his body going forward to such an extent John Collins had nowhere to come down just his seventh game as a Laker on a two-way contract his second season out of UAB offensive foul and Collins on the screen turnover by Utah four personal fouls on Collins the 8-year Pro second season in Utah after six years with the Hawks this is going to be six straight wins and 10 out of 11 for the Lakers make the case there isn't a team playing any better right now in the NBA than the LA Lakers well you look at all the metrics and the way they've changed over the last month at least a little bit longer in some cases but over the last 15 games this is the sixth rated defensive team in the NBA and that was their big issue at the start of the year they don't take a lot of Threes they don't play particularly fast their defense had to significantly improve and it has to give them a chance to go on a run like they're currently on and it will be interesting given that Anthony Davis is such a good defensive player how that will change for the Lakers how they make up for not having that with Davis no longer here it's going to be different uh you know they they a lot of times could run their offense through Anthony Davis to create these matchup problems with 611 ability to face up great mid-range shooter dominant on the offensive glass and then the amount of mistakes he would make up for defensively with his Rim protection and range and switchability down there so it's going to have a much different vibe and different feel to what they do in in in close games offensively and then some of the lineups you'll see defensively with really not a lot of depth at the center position cuz you do wonder about LeBron James the more he plays at that age you get into the playoffs what that what kind of toll that could take not Davis to help there defensively very true there but it also adding Luka Doncic takes a lot of pressure and wear a tear off of him offensively as well in terms of having to handle the ball his usage to creating for others so he will benefit there but you're right defensively that's a lot to make up for with what Anthony Davis brings to the table he's a perennial Defensive Player of the Year all defensive team candidate and when Dallas and Nico Harrison made the trade that that's one of the reasons they did it they felt that they were not good enough defensively uh even though they made it to the finals last year with that group and so they targeted Anthony Davis they did not open it up to all these other teams they said that's the guy we want to be the center piece of our team that's the argument they made but I think one area that they were shortsighted in you look at what Luka Doncic has done in the postseason in his career and and the way he shows up in those big moments series he's gotten his team through games he's he's won practically single-handedly it feels like some nights he shows up when the lights are bright that and that's innate I don't think you're Bor I don't think you you'll get that later in your career I think you're born with that Luka has it and and that's what you really wonder how you give up on something like that at 25 again you look at the scoring average along with the assists he accounts for 49 points per game that is the most in NBA history and he's not even 26 years old yet he'll turn turn 26 on February 28th 4 and a half to go Lakers W4 Utah 95 these teams will meet again Wednesday in Salt Lake Juzang gets the bounce and he's got 11 Off the Bench Lakers will stay in the three spot in the west tied with Denver and two back of Memphis for the number two seat boy how about Goodwin the two games he's played over for the last three days for the Lakers 10 points Saturday 17 in this game to go with seven rebounds in 17 minutes he was a player that JJ Freda kept mentioning we were talking in pregame about the rotation he kept bringing up Goodwin he got a little bit of a sparkle in his eye when his name came up you could just see uh JJ's demeanor and the way he talked about him how impressed he has been and certainly we have been getting to be here now for two games in a row and and watch him he's he's bounced around he had played in 121 NBA games prior to his SP here with three teams Memphis Phoenix and Washington in his fourth NBA season out of St Louis 11 fourth quarter points here you know you mentioned some of the numbers and metrics with LeBron and Luka you LeBron James this year fourth in the league in points actually created off of his assist meaning twos and threes he's fourth in the League last year Luka in a full season was third in the league so that's what you've now combined and the number of ways that they have to beat you James with eight assists in this game to go with 24 points and 29 minutes play filipowski in transition gives it up Ching challenge but a foul on Json 257 to go in this one Lakers on their way to their six great win the most anticipated debuts in NBA history Luka Doncic his first game as a Laker number 77 shirts won by worn by everybody in the building pregame Doncic taking the floor and look at all the people by the court an hour before before the game watching Luka warm up he was introduced last in the starting lineups tonight and this was his first basket a three-pointer finished with 14 points five rebounds four assists in 23 minutes yeah normally that kind of pregame activity is reserved for Steph Curry right that kind of look at the pregame warm-up Luka got that treatment tonight you see LeBron and Luka they're having a laugh on the bench probably some part saying to themselves can you believe they're actually letting us play together this is this is incredible to watch and to think about what the possibilities are and what the future for this team is going to be and what are those possibilities short term 25 Oklahoma City has proven to be the best team in the Western Conference that is the measuring stick right now and their defense is is the main reason for that so let's see what happens when the Lakers now with this new look go up against Elite defensive teams Elite teams uh later in the season that's when you'll get the real test but Dave I think now for me I look at them as a more realistic threat to do damage in the Western Conference and it a lot of that has to do with the track record of Luka Doncic in the postseason you look at the last three years as filipowski hits the three following the Markieff Morris three Markieff Morris played with the Lakers a few years ago now back part of the Luka trade they went to the Conference Finals beat Phoenix three years ago then they missed the playoff two years ago last year went to the NBA finals lost to the Celtics while Vanderbilt and Phil lowski both slow to get up Vanderbilt hobbling a little bit down the court keep an eye on that trying to walk it off got a Laker foul you know that's the thing that you know was still ringing in my head for several days after the trade it's not as if Luka Doncic hasn't had postseason success he went to a Conference Final and an NBA final by the age of 24 which is what he was last year when the finals took place and he lost last year in the finals to inarguably the best team in the NBA in the Boston Celtics so he's had postseason success regular season success wasn't ever as great in Dallas as it probably needed to be to make a significant run but he still got a team there and and you just look at what he's built for and the way he reacts to those pressure situations uh yeah the Lakers are going to be easily the most interesting team in the Western Conference over the remainder of the regular season because you got Oklahoma City at the top with a healthy lead eight games over everybody else and then you have this group of teams from two through five all separated by two games any of a bunch of teams 6 to 11 separated by two games so the final 30 games or so of the regular season in both conferences but I think more ey eyeballs will be on the west just because of some of the big names like Steph Curry and obviously luk and LeBron James well I'll put it this way I don't you know right now as I sit here I wouldn't bet on the Lakers to make the finals but I would say I'd be less surprised at them running through the Western Conference the way they're currently constructed than they were before the trade that's the impact that I think luk what about if Dallas is healthy and we don't know that because Davis is out right now Lively's out Gafford got hurt tonight again they're not going to have as much time because of the Davis injury to really put a body of work together to judge them but look they're going to be a very good team for all the reasons I mentioned before Anthony DAV is going to impact both ends of the floor you've still got Kyrie role players that went to the finals a year ago you added Klay Thompson um so the Dallas Mavericks are still a very good team but did they have that extra Factor that's what they now see playing for the Los Angeles Lakers and I said it on Saturday as fans all you can hope for is maybe you get somehow a Dallas La first round matchup to see what that would ultimately look like they still play twice including a game late in the season in Dallas on ESPN filipowski completes the three-point play so the Lakers will improve to 32 and 19 and 19- six at home this will be their sixth straight win matching their longest of the Season they've won 10 of 11 they're 19 and seven over their last 26 and it's hard to argue that anybody's playing better in the leag league right now than these Lakers and the defensive numbers I mentioned it's a big part of this Anthony Davis obviously an enormous piece for them defensively those numbers started to turn before the trade Anthony Davis helped to trigger this turnaround defensively so those are important numbers to watch now going forward with Luka in a different look and smaller lineups at times and see if those defensive numbers hold with Goodwin for the second time oh he just hurt himself too he second time he took off his mask having an issue with it throw threw it to the sideline then he had an awkward Landing but looks to be okay as he hops up it looked worse right would it happened but already dealing with a facial injury that's why he's been wearing a mask the last few games Lakers will be in Utah Wednesday to wrap up the pre-all-star break schedule LeBron James will play in his 21st Allstar game this weekend in the Bay Area Luka Doncic will get a chance at some extra rest before the Lakers play Charlotte after the break here at crypto.com Arena Shake Milton another acquisition by the Lakers before the deadline in a trade with Brooklyn going to drib a it out here and take a shot clock violation 8.3 remaining 8.6 rather a historic night here in Los Angeles immediately just because of the name and what Luka Doncic has done already he immediately joins the pantheon of great Lakers and it feels like the possibilities for this year and Beyond are endless with his talent and team with LeBron James all of those possibilities were on display as the Lakers tie their second largest point total of the season with 132 in throttle Utah Doncic in 23 minutes 14 points five rebounds four assists did struggle with a shot one of seven from three but In fairness has not played in six weeks first game since Christmas Day when he injured that left half LeBron James at 24 points eight assists seven rebounds Rui Hachimura had another big game 21 points that's his fifth 20-point game during this six-game win streak and George is with Luka thanks Dave Luka lots of anticipation and Fanfare for your debut here with the Lakers how did it feel to play in a Laker uniform special man uh the way they received me everybody teammates uh front office everybody here uh I heard a lot of noise when I was introduced uh so I really appreciate it it was a special moment what was the message from from JJ LeBron and your teammates to you today V simple V and I we saw that Dirk nitz was in the house here to support you today what does that mean to have him here means a lot great friend great mentor so it really means a lot that he was able to show up here I'll see him now but really means a lot and then lastly I know you guys still have to get comfortable with each other
