 for the second of a three-game trip for the Clippers James Harden and crew will take on the Mavericks once again on Thursday both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving sat due to injuries now while Luka is still out Kyrie is back and he's having one of his most efficient seasons of his career and absolutely will have the full attention of the Clippers here tonight we welcome you inside American Airlines they are alongside our favorite Dallas Maverick Jim Jackson I'm Brian sea great to have you with us David pingalore here as well well we really saw this first version of I's bots in the playoffs against Dallas back in April and May many thought if the Clippers were going to have some success they would need to see that carry over not only has it carried over but in many ways he might even be better he he is better because like they say variety is a spice of life and now Zubac is scoring in variety a different way whether it's in that short roll where he's in he has his little push shot in the middle or now he's comfortable posting up turning back to his right shoulder to score inside tip ends layups he's making play plays out of the double team so he's so much more valuable now offensively as a offensive threat meaning it's not always scoring he's facilitating he's able to initiate offense and make plays and the other part of that equation of addition by subtraction is this man right here Normal Norman well he started off a little bit slow in the last game but we said to ourselves once Norman hits a couple of shots he' be right back in the groove and he's continuing his scorching ways he's going to be key tonight that he put up a really good quick number but also start off to a fast pace second straight game without LCA Doncic for Dallas they do get Kyrie Irving back and as great of an offensive player as he has been throughout his career not sure he's ever shot the ball better than he is right now but it's amazing when you play with a top tier player like luuka Don out the game now becomes easier you have more space to work it you can pick and choose exactly what Kyrie when he wants to score remember it was like last year where it was like the third quarters really really took off cuz he didn't need to press the situation and that's the same thing this year that's why he's so efficient right now because he can pick and choose when he needs and wants to be aggressive whether that's off the dribble in transition it's a beautiful thing I hope he's not as efficient tonight oh last time we saw Derrick Jones Jr here at American Airlines sitter he was knocking down shots and locking up players on Thursday he was finally wearing the correct uniform on the other side Jim Jackson breaks it down was quite an opportunity for the Clippers no Luka Doncic no Kyrie Irving in Dallas in this first of two Clippers took full advantage of it now game two Kyrie is in Luka is out take a look at the starting five for the Clippers this is literally the fourth best lineup in the NBA meanwhile for the Mavericks this lineup has played a grand total of three minutes together so an opportunity here for the Clippers to duplicate what they did on Thursday and for more on that here is David pingalore he of course on this Saturday evening and yes they flew in here on Wednesday and they dominated Thursday night my goodness of course there was no or Luka playing in the game but look at look at the stats in that game shooting lights out three-point land field goals points in the paint obviously the big fell tonight's looking for a big game we're talking about Zubac Ty little bit ago told us in the little pregame you know presser how he likes being here almost like a baseball type of series little dinners out family you know it's the holiday so he enjoys this and it should be an interesting game tonight as they played just a couple nights ago dominate good to be here with Jimmy tonight Brian when I walked in with him he's like a god here it's unbelievable walking around with him he was opening up malls he was cutting ribbons for stores it was quite a scene it was very nice there was a a a nice lady just to our left that had an old shirt has to be 30 plus years old 95 triple JS unreal always good to come back to Dallas let's see what the Clippers can do here one thing I'm paying attention to is efficiency around the iron especially for Dallas they're one of the league leaders in that category shooting over 70% at The Rim Thursday they were 9 for 20 give a lot of credit to a Zubac for a lot of things on Thursday Hardon against his one time teammate here Zubac that floer from the foul line not there this time and PJ Washington has it for Dallas well with Kyrie now on the lineup it presents a different challenge in particular with the pick and roll so keep our eye on that when he has the ball in Clippers on defense the Mavericks this year without Luka but with Kyrie have been very good 5- one and they have beat big teams not little cupcake teams this is a a fully loaded roster in the sense of everybody can step up certainly in short order one thing that Kao said they do without Lua they play really fast exhibit a transition three for PJ Washington just his ninth Corner three of the Year struggles in the corners very good above the break yeah but that's where this MTH team in particular when Kyrie is back in the lineup they push quick now they have the ability to locate and find and get some open shots Harden 24 Seven assists five rebounds in the game on Thursday Norman accelerates on Den witty the floater is good and Norman Norman signs his autograph on the game well that's what makes Norman so tough is because you have to play him for the drive but also for the catch and shoot and the pull up off the three so he does have an advantage offensively with his skill set against his Defenders three out there Lively very Lively on the glass gives to Irving back to L he was five for five on Thursday and it's a very high percentage shot here on Saturday yeah in the game before I think he was four for four so now he's you know 10 for 10 in the last couple very good response that time by Harden able to get right back now get keep in mind we dominated the paint uh in the last game against Dallas Lively against his teammate one time and Derrick Jones shooting it to the rim and man counted and a foul we heard that tyo likes these series for the dinners out but he did say the opposition definitely knows how you're going to attack them and we're seeing it right here with Dallas yeah and Dereck Lively is living up to his name right now because the activity in which he is able to bring to the table tough because he's always moving so to get him he does an excellent job of reading especially when Luka and Kyrie are in the lineup you know a l threat cuts when to get to the basket when to clear space Hardon tries to wrap around to Zubac it's picked off here comes Irving the other way accelerates into Norman finds Thompson on the wing for three in and out Thompson was just two for nine on Thursday after hitting half of his threes in the previous three games Harding around JY lobs it to Zubac can't tap it in rebound batted out of bounds last Touch by Dallas yeah James thought he was hit on that lob it maybe it was a lob it was a shot attempt whatever it was James wasn't too happy was not too happy with the officials in the no call but fortunately for the clips they were able to retain The Possession 14 seconds on the shark clock only had time to shoot here for the Clippers they are two for four time to shoot for Zubac Zubac rolls has Thompson to beat puts it up puts it in counted on a foul and a nice play there for the Clippers late in the clock but that's because Norm is going to draw attention because Norm can shoot this shot off the dribble so Lively committ it all the way even with the rotation of Klay Thompson he's giving up you know 6 in and right there Zubac did the right thing one he gathered himself off two feet knowing he had the double team and he was able to softly put it in and he Clippers down two here early on in the first quarter we'll talk about Zubac absolutely Sensational on Thursday Kyrie Irving inside not there rebound batted over to drik Jones Jr Clippers looking to push when he gets back drick Jones attacks oh and a very friendly roll as if he knows the rims here in Dallas yeah but that's part of being athletic too because Den Woody did an excellent job of taking away the left hand but the athleticism of Jones Jr allowed him to hang in air just a little bit longer create that shot and finish was a 20 minute minute restriction for Derrick Jones Jr we'll see if that extends here tonight he played five minutes in each of the four quarters tough shot by Kyrie Irving what else do you do if you're Chris done nothing you can do I mean you put a hand up he's fading away back to the sideline Baseline and that's all you can do great Mayers great players you know Brian make incredibly tough shots Harden it's Jones in the corner for three straight but strong he hit both of his three-point efforts Thursday buter is down two inside of 8 minutes to play in the opening frame gwy out of Taft High School in Los Angeles plays to Thompson Santa Margarita in the corner to Washington on the Fly by it Norman Washington attack stripped recovered by Norman knocked out of bounds and the ball goes back to Dallas Lo James Harden come at the last minute because PJ Washington his eyes were focused and located at Zubac and that's how James was able to strip it below hard looks very active in this first quarter Rises for three it's offline diny with a rebound 720 to play in the first quarter Irving for three Irving missed the game on Thursday with the shoulder injury crosscourt pass intercepted Irving tripped up whistle foul stops the clock 710 to play in the frame you know what's interesting about this Mavericks team is they're not a big mid-range shooting team but in the prior game because with no Luka no Kyrie they were like 10 for 17 on mid-range shots and that's something if you the Clippers you ran them off the three-point line you forced them into taking more twos but a lot of that was a byproduct because you weren't creating those shots off the dribble because of no Irving and Luke and now it's going to change a little bit because Kyrie's in the lineup but it it'd be interesting to see how we guard the three-point line tonight didn't what the floater strug in the first three quarters found his Groove a little bit in the fourth whistle foul as Zubac has the rebound you saw the numbers with Kyrie with and without Luka Doncic as we get a good look at the fou shot goes up here right there didn't when he's trying to poke it away there's Luka go back to that playoff series I think I'm saying anything crazy that it was Kyrie Irving that was the best player in that series Doncic was picked up certainly hit some massive shots as he's been one to do against the Clippers Kyrie took over second halves of those games he was sensal but listen Kyrie played that role with Cleveland that times with LeBron James you know we all know about the big time shot he hit kind of sealed a deal for their championship against you know Golden State at the time so that's nothing new for Kyrie Zubac struggling here after being so dominant on Thursday Zubac just one for four Zubac is 10 for 13 with 215 and five for the Clippers Irving tries to get clever with the bounce Mavericks recover Marshall for three it's good just 31% on the year knocks it down tyo does not like what he has seen as the Mavericks jump out in front by five half success this year aita Zubac was going to have to kind of do what he did in the playoffs and well here we are while he is scoring one point less rebounds are up assists are up field goal percentage up him reading the defense kind of the intangibles as well you can mess with filters to make things look nice but these are pretty basic filters and that is very non-basic company that is at leite as he gets yeah it it it is and you think about it his usage rate is not as high of course as giannis's or domas it's a bonus so for him to be in that company just tells you how valuable he is and how much his teammates value that production and everything too Zubac the ball knocked out of bound by Irving you see air coughing is out there so five minutes for drick Jones Jr they're going to make sure that he is 150% before they start loading on that normal volume of minutes but I mentioned when he is in the lineup the Clippers this year through 30 almost 30 Games the fourth best lineup in the League when it comes to net rating that lineup has the third best defense in the league they struggled a little bit out of the gate 13 to8 they Trail done driven off the line late in the clock and to have to put it up the heave ahead of the horn and the rebound batted out of bounds by Zubac and it goes back to Dallas Mavericks 5 for 12 Clippers 4 for 10 look at the games that Luka has missed Kyrie has not been a dominant force in the first quarters letting the game come to him you saw the numbers he does average more he has to work a lot harder takes six more shots not as efficient as he is when luuka is on the floor this is another tough shot by Kyrie misses everything Clippers get it well the defense now can focus in when Luke is not on the court with Kyrie you got to take things away and when you don't focus on your backside rotation Norman Norman may you pay with an easy layup inside now two for two Clippers down by three car trying to work without the ball deflected recovered by the Clippers Here Comes Harden dun spots up on the wing in transition straight but strong rebound kept alive but it's Lively that gets it Marshall tries to cross over Harden whistle and a foul stops the clock 501 to play here the first well take advantage of of your mismatches when you can in particular in transition this is when you can really exploit one-on-one opportunities if F the Clippers Norm on cber that is a mismatch waiting to happen that time if you go quick the defense is not set the back line is not there and pal able to really take advantage of that in transition a gentle finish by Norman Norman he was showing you can just he can throw it down but he just wanted to lay it over the top that's it Marshall spins on Coffey very active here in his short time on the floor gets rewarded again with free throws well but you talked about when Luc is not in the lineup and Kyrie has to take over it was four games during the course of this season when LCA wasn't in and ni Marshall had you know he was averaging over 20 plus points a game during that time he's coming back off of uh a illness so not playing as well right now but very valuable to what they do especially on the defensive end and spotting up knocking down shots just his third game in December as we get a quick word from Jerome furniture get ready with incredible deals and check out our no interest financing until 2027 only at jeromes been his first four years in New Orleans father was a professional boxer he was actually a boxer nji until about 13 said he always had the love for basketball hope he get some good cardio in over the summer Zubac hands off to Norman picked up by Gafford steps back for straight off bu it three for three is Norman he's got seven and he brings the Clippers to it in two and that's a good sign for the Clippers I mean when Norman can get started early the defense has to shift and he can get his teammates some open looks and Gafford one of those fouls you don't want to have if you're the Mavericks that give it up to Zubac but watch Norman right here patience Gaffrey goes back isolates Marshall doesn't want to fully commit to Norman nor that he can Bounce It Off the dribble a little bit and get by him but that's the respect you got to have when you have the the toolkit offensively that Normal Norman has Kevin Porter junr now out there as dun takes a seat Harden calls his Zone number from 10 in and out Clippers have missed some pretty good shots here Zubac is around the iron hard misses there on the 10-footer Marshall goes to work n by Zubac knocked out of bounds by Gafford it's Clipper ball and that's the value of Zubac inside his Rim protection numbers will tell you that are not exactly the same as they were last year but he's still a deterrent Porter junior on Grimes crosses him over down the lane and we've said it for the last few weeks so a lead in the paint and Kevin Porter Jr ties up the score at 15 go Gafford not a threat out there neither of the two centers with Lively are much of a threat outside of the restricted area rebound back tapped over to half court and 14 placed back on the clock for Grimes Irving shadowed by Norman Zubac active on the glass it goes to Pal Coffey on the break over the shoulder of Harden unforced error I will say this this Jim you go back to October early November we were talking a lot about the variance in the turnovers we haven't seen bad turnovers in quite a long time and and the ones that you see Porter Jr able to get to his right hand and finish but the ones that really hurt us with the you always talked about this with the live ball turnover okay we' doing a a lot better job I think guys are settling in not trying to take chances with passes if it's not there initially you pull it back ball fake and move it that's helped secure your def defense as well when you're not turning it over in particular when when they live ball cers come in top six defensively Kyrie Irving on the wing for three and horseshoes off Irving now one for seven in this first quarter Clippers looking to break the tie here Harden on Marshall for three it is short and Quentin Grimes comes away with a loose ball for Dallas Whoppers have not LED in this one Mavericks have led by as many as five Primes recalibrates gets to the block and knocks it in mention players that have stepped up in Luka Don's absence Grimes is one of the headliners in that category bar been very active and very aggressive on both sides of the ball he does pick up the foul there 217 to play in the first quarter Mavericks by two enjoy the game I think important for a kid to Allstar voting your vote counts for three votes here today voting open until now for just a bit about a month you can vote the MB fnba.com I would nominate Little James Harden little Normal Norman action would love to see one or both of those guys get in it'll be tough let's be honest y by the way while we have an opportunity I would love to say happy birthday to the game of basketball 133 years how about it great guy Dr James naith Dr J the original Dr J I used to live on N Smith Drive I used to live right next to fog Allen Fieldhouse and would drive by Dr n Smith's grave site several times a week so I felt very connected to the game and did you talk to him at his gravite did you ask him any questions get some uh his restraining order is still valid Porter junior coming out of the time out in the mid-range this time and knocks it down he has been up and down the last couple of ball games but comes out here and ties up the score at 17 he's two for two Off the Bench but that's the confidence that the coaching staff has in him out of the timeout drew a play up for him to be able to get isolated and he came through with making the basket so confidence is there in this young man you know his ability to get by you and finish with a his athleticism and that time he loves to get to that right hand step back being a lefty slowly but surely finding his form we saw it in Houston he is a very gifted scorer trying to find a new role with a team that has expectations to win and that's no slight on Houston but they were in full rebuild when Porter Jr was down there with Steven Silas and a bunch of young players here's one of them you see really finding his own Rhythm here with the Clippers Gafford 67% on the year makes the second Clippers looking for their first lead of the game mentioned earlier they've trailed by as many as five Porter junior good defense by Grimes a deep three for har oh it is good and he puts the Clippers out in front 20- 18 Haron with his second basket got a couple of rebounds as well Dinwiddie in the corner for three it's good and he has struggled in his last few ball games just two for 15 from distance but like we saw too di witty caught a little fire at fourth quarter you don't want to get him started Bamba a straight off three it is short he has struggled from three here in this season just trying to get his legs back now five for 22 overall Marshall nice pass inside The Gafford misses the jam the Clippers have it inside of a minute to of play in the first quarter it's a low-scoring first frame leers scored 68 points in the second half on Thursday har maybe got away with a walk floats it up but not in despite the long arms of Mo Bamba can't come away with a loose ball Marshall he's been in attack mode since his number's been called and he delivers again he's got he looks like he has more energy tonight than he did on Wednesday which is probably not the best sign for us that he's feeling a little bit better glad he is but he is looking aggressive Brian about a 9se second shot to game clock differential it'll be Dallas ball to start the second quarter hard in the lob oh it's a floater and it's good and it cuts the lead down to one hard now with seven we he's got a unique release on that floater and it works for him shot clock is turned off Marshall once again maintains the aggression it's a double clutcher it misses badley and the Clippers get a goal line stand and they Trail by one at the end of one as the Clippers hanging around here trying to steal two in Dallas with no Luka Doncic James Harden doing some work so was Norman Norman Clippers Trail by one after one by James Harden Harden with seven points in the first quarter he'll start the second quarter on the bench but rapidly climbing the ladder in terms of scoring leaders in the NBA there you see it I hope he passes Tim Duncan tonight I'd be very excited if he passed Dominique Wilkins it cost maybe 200 more points yeah deny and the Mavericks has promised control to start the second didn't W he inside it's good Maverick's just third 8 7% from the field yet they lead by three but of a concern if you're following here with the Clippers well I mean but you know Wednesday's game we were down six in the first quarter 24 to 30- 24 but we were able to really play a lot better in the second quarter so let's see what the Clippers have in mind here Kevin Porter Jr for three and it's got he's three for three and he ties up the score as we get this second quarter underway Porter Jun get Buckets man I mean you got to respect his driving ability when you do that you want to force him to be a jump shooter but seems to have some Rhythm right now speaking of which you don't want that young man to start getting into a rhythm which he has been over the last four games at no point during that shot that I think he had control of the ball but then he but you know Shooters like that all they got to do is fill it on the fingertips that's all you have to do and the rest is just this years of practice and you were saying poell gets a quick touch can't get it to fall PJ Washington controls for Dallas out in front by three Dinwiddie he feeling good Grimes with a long rebound Dinwiddie ball fake plays catch with Lively then goes right back to Lively the floater is good and Dereck Lively now three for three hasn't missed a shot in a few games but that's you know that quick shot by Den Wy some people say it's a good shot bad shot but if you do it quick enough and you have offensive rebound and you get a chance to get it back like they did and they ended up taking advantage of that quick shot and transition and offensive rebound Lively has it picked up by Bamba the two went to the same High School different times of course same high school as cam reddish as well Thompson turns the Corner attacks the rim and lays it in not a great start here for the Clippers and a timeout for tyo Dallas with the largest lead of the game out in front by seven to families and into a dome this is all part of Clippers adop the family event Normal Norman little meet and greet kids certainly love that after the game look at the parents happy for their kids and when you can see Normal Norman smiling he's going to make a bunch of people smile this holiday season and that right there is what the holidays are all about give back and he'd be to tell you the first he'd be the first to tell you that's what it's certainly all about the young man from UCLA during the holidays gentlemen Norm is a good egg there's zero question about that I mentioned it before the dedication to his craft and I don't know how dedicated he is to getting that scar taken care of no no that's part of his super it is that's the origin story that's what it is it's it's coming up on almost a year now want to say in February but it has given him superpowers and he's in the starting lineup and he has been phenomenal in the role that he has been dreaming of since he was in junior high order Junior weaves inside nine to shoot for patum good ball movement they go to Zubac singly covered by Lively patum leans in and draws the foul go to the line for three free throws it's not a place he has been all that this year just eight total free throws attempted by our favorite Frenchman yeah but you know you don't have to get there often but because he is a threat from behind the line Klay with the long close out kind of under not under control Nico read his feet knew that he was probably going to bite for that pump fate got him in the air got himself to the line he is he has the most points from any native born Frenchman it's not going to last long because of a guy in San Antonio enjo who is it what's his name Young Kai right tip off the new year with a new Clippers tow pack get your tickets for our game against the Hawks on Friday the 4th and be among the first 10,000 fans in attendance to get a red statement Jersey tote bag that's it that's not a jersey that's actually a bag put your groceries in there put some fun things in there go to clippers.com tickets bomb knocks down all three the Clippers is just one for four and the Mavericks going four for five Trail by just four Lively spins away from Porter Jr floats it up he misses for the first time in a long time and Zubac has the rebound Maverick's doing a better job of competing Porter Jun pull up and quick shot in the paint right now tied up 1414 that was an area where the Clippers dominated in our first game of this series The Mavericks have hit three of three in the painted area in this second quarter after going four of 10 in the first whistle foul looks like Porter Jr gets the brunt of it but let's take look at at the end he gets over the top and now oh yeah he caught that and again that's not intentional by Den witty but Porter Jr is trying to get he gets over that screen leans into it and at the same time unfortunately then Woody is attempting this shot to go up and he gets the blun of that contact we're going to have a challenge on this one 837 to play in the first quarter motion therefore this foul is going to stand as a defensive foul and the challenge is unsuccessful play will resume with three free throws and La will lose that timeout you can see what they were I don't think Dinwiddie did anything wrong there I agree with you Jim meanwhile Pat fryer we saw him rehearsing we saw him warming up before the game in front of the camera all true stories he is a noons delivery not much of a Storyteller no he he's straight to the point he's like no nonsense and I told him said the camera angle we need to make you look better okay so we need to adjust it and bring it up a little bit more he said man that's not going to work so he he he he had a little comedic sense of humor to that right there but we're going to test we're going to put him to the test tonight I wouldn't say that it was it wasn't a bad delivery it was fine it was just straight business fine is really not good fine is like okay I'll deal with we've seen some of these other officials though we'll take take five all three freee throws fall for Dinwiddie and the Mavericks match their largest lead of seven Zubac tries to send it across Court intercepted by Denwood he deflected out of bounds I Believe by the Mavericks it's Clipper ball do a bullet there Dallas four for six in the quarter Clippers one for five first turnover for the Clippers in the half five in the game B is shooting 41% that they lead by seven just have to get something going Zeus spots an entry drives on lively surrounded by Defenders off the window at in no style points it does count for two and we will take it you know how hard that shot is man to slam it right off the middle of the backboard right in the lane but Zubac wasn't pretty like you said but it counts for two much needed two great ball movement Marshall in the corner spins off rebound goes back to aita Zubac his seventh flippers down a handful por Jun tries to drive on Irving kry reaches in deflex it takes it away whistle and a crime of passion from Kevin Porter junior after the steal by Kyrie Irving yeah but Kai knew exactly what Kevin Porter Jr wanted to do he wanted to get to that step back so Kai cut off the initial dribble going left but he waited waited and as soon as Kevin por junr went into his move KY was right there on top of it to slap it away Porter Jr offensively three for four from the field picks up his second foul in the process trying to get some more offense on the floor here James Harden Norm pal back out there Eric Jones Jr joins the fry picking up Spencer Dinwiddie right now puts it into the front row a rebuke there by Derrick Jones Jr now one defense don't want to get yourself caught in rotation so the better you guard the ball initially the less you get in rotation beautiful read by Kyrie but that Zubac his presence once again make Kyrie shoot it a little bit higher off there Jones J there good defense by Naji Marshall a little bit of concern here for the Clippers if you ask me 38% shooting for Dallas Kyrie Irving is one for eight they lead by five as many as seven yeah but you know and and these series backto back not backto back games but playing two games you know why you're on the road against the same team goad no it has a little something and you said it m are not playing great but yet we're down but that could be good too cuz if we can go on a little run we can capture the lead here and to start here with the Norman Norman three it's in the air short rebound goes to Marshall Norman now one for four from above the arc we've seen him heat up the despite slow starts deny nice effort there to bounce it to Gafford deflected out of bounds you know what encourages me though Brian even though we're missing the shots and we're not shooting the ball well right now only 42 43% but we're getting the shots we want to get so it's different if the Mavs are dictating what our shot selection is or isn't but that's not the case we're not hitting some of the shots that we normally make but the Mavericks aren't either Kyrie now one for nine Norman in transition on Kleber dun tough pass for Norman and another turnover is that the third out of four possessions here for the clippers eight total but of the eight turnovers the previous seven only three points against tyo Squad man that goes into the shooting too it's not the defense I don't think by the Mavs that are forcing these turnover that time Norma can never really gather and get control of the ball he wanted to make the move in the corner but didn't have possession hence you turned it over Gafford accosted by Zubac that'll be the first foul on aita Zubac third foul on the Clippers here in the second quarter Midway through we saw this yesterday eight fouls for the Clippers five for Dallas that's not a comment on the officiating that was something that Brian Shaw talked about wanting to clean up at the second half defend without fouling but a muddied up game I think absolutely has to favor the Clippers in a situation like this trying to steal two in Dallas after LCA Doncic kyri Irving don't play in Thursday's game Doncic out here tonight you can see Dereck Lively so terrific Gafford was really good is really good but Lively has just been super special in his second year but that's why you draft the Dereck Lively because of his potential is upside once he gets comfortable they knew that Lively wasn't quite ready last year so having Gafford there as a stop Gap someone he can learn from but eventually Lively is the one that they they kind of foreseen to be in the lineup they were very creative with how they got that draft pick or at least held on to it I should say done in the corner for three great effort there by Marshall gets it ahead to Irving picked up by Derrick Jones J they swing it to Grimes driven off the line by Zubac attacks the rack and leaves it in largest lead of the game and Quentin Grimes is two for two Off the Bench for Dallas Harden trying to get something going Clippers just three for 14 from three interception by Derrick Jones Jr Norman on the wing clean look can't get it to go rebound back Tapped Out of Bounds well listen grind your way through right now the shots you're not going in keep the game within the balance okay keep it below double figures cut this lead down before you go on a half because all you need if you can do that Brian you just need a spurt some passes get to the free throw line now the game looks totally different but you can't let it get away these last 5 minutes strong move by Gafford inside his first bucket he was 0 for four on Thursday 437 to play here in this second quarter Clippers Trail by 11 Norman accelerates inside from behind Gafford knocks it out of bounds Norman Norman wants a whistle he's not going to get it quing with a technical let's take a look at what Norman's talking about right let's go everybody's upset about something I didn't see any contact on a shot maybe he didn't like how hard Gafford out of bound Harden creates the contact on Kyrie but can finish however does get a whistle and James Harden will go to the free throw line this has been kind of a a bell weather for the Clippers when Harden gets to the line they are tough to beat these are just his first free throws oh 22 for 2 24 in the last two games his free throw shooting this year is up which is good 7.4 free throw attempts this year compared to 4.8 last year which means his activity is there cation don't miss out on the action single game tickets in the wall add into it D start at 29 bucks go to clippers.com ticks now and get your seats before they're gone December 27th is an interesting date we know nothing we're speculating 100% but if I hadn't been to a game Jim Jackson this year and wanted to see into a dome I'm buying tickets yesterday if for nothing else a heck of a team that's put together quite a run here in the first now 28 games this is 29 whistle travel turnover Ball's going the other way by the way you saw I don't know if he was trying to demonstrate that he wasn't reaching in but after the contact that James Harden created it was quite a blow against Kyrie Irving it almost looked like he was just trying to favor a shoulder if you could and it's a shoulder injury that kept him out of the game on Thursday something to pay attention to even before the injury Kyrie just one for nine this is during one of his best shooting seasons of his career which says a lot hard from the nail it's good the fansings Hallelujah and a timeout here as these two teams are just throwing rocks at each other here in the first half it's 4134 Mavericks really turning up the efficiency you see it he has been phenomenal we mentioned a little bit's getting extra sleep he's you know kind of figuring out his timing with having no shoot runs remember before shoot runs he would have a rigorous warm-up that was very game speed very intense those are now gone he's saving his legs at the age of 35 and here we are now 35 or so% way into the season he's been the best he has been this year for the Clippers who have asked a ton for him and again help could be on the way sooner rather than later k Irving in the corner to Grimes for three in and out rebound tapped over to Washington and he floats it in on his second effort fourth offensive rebound sixth Second Chance point for Dallas their top 10 in that league and they lead 43 to 34 Harden lots of contact no whistle Derrick Jones Jr in the corner for three whistle loose ball foul against Dallas be the third against the Mavericks battling is going to get the hook in may have got away with that but he got I think defensive said that Gafford had control over Zubac beforehand good for us Norman on the Fly by long one for six so far in the first half he hit his first two shots of the game he's three for n overall what a pass nice defense Inside by Harden interrupting what would have been an easy basket for Maxi Kleber and the foul on Harden well and that's the power of Kyrie because Norm po you know is always defensive principles ball you man but watching Kyrie to see what was going to happen that's when he lost contact eye contact with Kleber CER who went back door and that's what a dynamic player like that can do for you at times is freeze you and open up some opportunities for his teammates they were late to add the foul it's second on Harden this is just the seventh free throws here by Maxi Kleber he makes the second a 10-point lead Dallas this year 17- one with a double digit advantage that has usually involved Luka Doncic but again they have found success without do on the floor 5 and one nice play by Washington plenty of time on the clock for Norman tries to bounce inside to Zubac turnover number nine Mavericks just 39% from the field Clippers 37% Washington loses it but Clippers come back the other way hard crashing into Cleo whistle and a foul we'll see if they rule that a shooting foul the four team foul for Dallas and now the Clippers and Mavericks both with four team fouls it's interesting you've been around this a long long time to know this the older you get the crafter you get you know you're not going to elevate over opponent or blow by so you you have to figure out ways to still be effective offensively when you're not as athletic and quick as you want to and James is using the ground game so to speak to be his way of getting to the line creating shots he uses those broad shoulders and initiates contact I do feel the need to say I feel like he did that even in his prime yeah but it wasn't like I mean he's really using body cuz he has to create space before he could b b dribble and get by now it's not as easy so he's using his shoulders his leverage his initial contact to create that space that up and under shot he now he was doing that when he was getting by guys but now you know just different ways to be effective those two free throws he now passes Tim Duncan on the all-time leading scorers list which says a lot about Tim Duncan by the way with the numbers that James hard was putting up for those years in Houston 4636 Mavericks by 10 another tough pass inside Dallas with two minutes to play here trying to feather The Nest heading into the break Dinwiddie for three I'm not sure it got halfway there Lively with a rebound Washington good above the break on threes not there rebound back Tapped Out of Bounds and goes back to the Clippers the two teams have combined to go seven for 32 from three so essentially not shooting the ball that what you say I would say it's tough to win a game when you shoot below 40% overall but someone's going to have to win this game well but I'm not you know what though in a night like this on the road neither team is shooting well which I'm glad because if we're not shooting well I'm Dallas is not and you know it's a four possession game I'll kind of take that cuz if we limit our turnovers maybe get some stuff in transition it's a different way in a different game maybe in the second half Normal Norman perhaps these can help get him back on track just one for six from above the ark knocks down first and cuts a lead into single digits say the season of gifting has tipped off with no fees on tickets in the wall as's your chance to score the perfect gift for your favorite Clipper fans yours of clippers.com tickets we'll be back to see the wall on December 27th Clippers hosting the Golden State Warriors who are kind of going through it right nowers have won the first two games against Golden State Lively the hand of Ky and does tend to shoot two teammates in Brooklyn Irving gets around him leaps and leans not there rebound oh it's a big one by Lively a mansiz rebound in the corner to Kyrie the three is good but it's a tough one 49 38 Mavericks Porter Juni M handled boy Wheels coming off here in the second quarter Clippers trying to get to a standing a count before the break Kyrie for three feeling good Lively with another rebound and it's Thompson in the corner for three and the Clippers Coming Undone self inflicted wounds and the lead balloons to 14 you say it seven turnovers here in the second quarter two for one opportunity Harden to retaliate the threes offline rebound poked over to Zubac Clippers have it Norman attacks hangs and lays it in points 10 and 11 for Norman Norman momentarily stops the bleeding let go it'll be Dallas ball to start the third but they're looking to add of the momentum here this has always been a rock his crowd when we have been in town and they're starting to use their voice here in the second quarter Thompson Klay Thompson is four for six there's time for the Clippers Harden checks the clock Porter in the corner ahead of the horn in and out so the Clippers self dest struck in the last two minutes with turnovers and giving up offensive rebounds they Trail by 14 but history has been made as James Harden passes Tim Duncan in the first half on the all-time scoring list work to be done here in Dallas about James Harden there must be something in the water in Texas this is where he had some of his best years he was terrific on Thursday and trying to keep the Clippers in it in that first half he was 4 for 10 with 13 doing some damage from the free throw line four for four and three rebounds is credited for five turnovers although I'm not sure how responsible he is for all of those but from a kind of a point in history you see it was passing Tim Duncan in terms of the all-time scoring list kudos to James Harden meanwhile one of the reasons why the score is a little lopsided at the break second J points for Dallas they were really great on the glass in fact when they win the rebounding War they are are 11 and0 they're doing that in the first half here 24 to9 but it was the Second Chance efforts especially two of them leading to threes late in the second that helped create some of the separation that we see right now there is 24 minutes left in this game neither team really all that great from the field an opportunity here for the Clippers as we send it over to David pingalore all right Brian I just spoke to Brian sh the assistant coach he said obviously 54 401 Striking Distance couple of things here got to be better screening of the basketball we got to be have better get better screens get better shots and you got to keep Dereck Lively off the boards killing him right now they do those three three things it'll be a good Christmas because they're going to come in here and get two games they got to continue they got to get better in those three areas but they earn Striking Distance Jimmy how do you like that for an analyst well TS the season so TS the season D that's that's really good puzzled look a SE season of giving to let David do my job that's okay Dave you got it well the Mavericks open up with a turnover let's see if the Clippers can't get something going here Harden picked up by Lively steps back and knocks it down that's the fifth bucket for Harden 15 overall in the game the Clippers make a little noise here not shooting the ball all that well but their defense might be able to keep them in the only concern I have is a double digit lead and Kyrie Irving who has the ball is two for 12 Den witty no and the rebound goes to Derrick Jones Jr Dallas now six of 20 from three Clippers would love that percentage they're three for 19 tough pass for Zubac handle inside perhaps Thompson the other way as the turnovers continue here for the Clippers Washington in the corner for three spins off yeah D the bullet there you know and to add to David's report too you know the offensive rebounds you know right now 12 points Dallas had a total of 12 Second Chance points or 10 second chance points in the game on Wednesday so plus two in that category and we're only at half but that you clean up that and also what we just saw with James those turnovers just you reel them back in let's get some shots at The Rim 12 turnovers here for the Clippers the good news only eight points off of those turnovers just missed opportunities really for the Clippers six giveaways for Dallas eight points off of those for the Clippers drick Jones Junior way off on the three Dinwiddie with a rebound Dinwiddie looks like a different player tonight that he did for the first three quarters on Thursday been very active been very aggressive even with Kyrie on the floor this is a lineup that hasn't seen a lot of time together we mentioned it at the top of the show just three total minutes hard to tell they're playing very well together they lead by 14 Den Woody 10 points five assists three rebounds here almost 2 minutes off this third quarter clock lob to Derrick Jones Jr catches and casually drops it into the cylinder Above the Rim throw it up he'll go get it right now couple bass good defense that time by Klay on Klay leaves Irving open the Miss shot rebound goes to Norman it's a running one and the Clippers looking to push dck Jones Jr backs it out putting a time on the clock here for Harden it's around Kyrie finds dun Hees it from three it's online and it is good the first bucket for done and it cuts the lead down to single digits 56 to 47 it's amazing what happens to your offense um more efficient it is when you're valuing the basketball then you end up getting some good looks able to knock it in and wow on the gamble does it pay off Lively had the layup after dun flies by it exposes Irving in the corner and he knocks down the three to retaliate Norman the floater Norman four for 12 once a whistle not going to get it flirting with a technical here you can tell he's been frustrated really all night long yeah Kyrie it's what you don't want to see starting to warm up one of the greatest offensive players in League leag history as tyo who coached him in Cleveland said he does not have a flaw in his offensive game Harden doesn't have one either whistle foul stops the clock to play in the third but let's go back to DJ in the back door cut keep kick your eye on Klay right here he's ball watching and how many times have we seen James Harden make that pass from the opposite side of the court right there where the flash Mark is that close to the sideline heble deliver it and with a guy like dere Jones Jun just throw it up close man he'll go get it got to be a really bad pass yeah and sometimes the worst passes are the best Ali oops pardon make it Norman beg your pardon late in the clock had to fire that one up he's one for seven from three the first four for 22 overall they were 14 of 33 on Thursday Irving shows off the handles but Dunn is right there and then throws it away Mavericks recovered Den witty for three power with a rebound and that's great weak side help by Derrick Jones Jr I think it was that knocked that pass away the lob attemp that Kyrie was trying to make and that's his really good weak side defense to rotate Over There You Go ZO Harden tries to sell the contact it's a Zubac beating the bcks at their own game with a second chance effort 6149 Dy creates contact but doesn't create a whistle Harden alone on the wing eases into the three offline Zubac with another rebound and lays it in counted on a foul Big Time sequence there for aita Zubac it doesn't take much they you know for them to get back in this game and Brian this is what you need get it up quick now we can give Dallas a piece of their own medicine so to speak with a second shot Zubac doing a really good job of beating Dereck Lively down the court that allows him to get him on his back keep the concentration eyes up at The Rim points 12 rebounds like to see him involved maybe a little bit more in that middle pick and roll with h James that opens up so many opportunities there you go Z knock it in there's been a lot of rebounds to have with both teams struggling that said Clippers now five of 10 from the field here in the third and they scored Dallas by five trimming the lead into single digits Thompson Runner off line Zubac has the rebound hands it off to hardeners making some noise in the third exactly what they need to do Washington on Harden on the switch howwell gets around Washington gets into the paint ladles it to Zubac oh it's a ferocious finish for aita Zubac spots seven unanswered Clippers Trail 6154 Naji Marshall in leaves it short rebound goes to Zubac and now the Clippers begin to flex 638 to play in the third in a very quiet American Airlines Arena Norman whistle foul free throws coming a Timeout on the floor Z vit Zubac taking over here in the second half yeah Normal Norman not shooting the ball well but still attracts tension attention dumps it off for Zubac to cut into this whether it's getting the offensive rebounds being a lot more active than Dereck Lively here in this third quarter whether running the court getting inside able to get to the free throw line and then in that dunker spot got on the inside of Kyrie Irving three for three this quarter five rebounds too offensive right now his 11th double double in the last 14 games and I I I said it that as bad as you know we've shot the ball you're there you get some stops you take care of it Dallas is not you know shooting the lights out of it so they give you an opportunity Brian to get in this game and we kind of see that here the middle of this third quarter by the Clippers you I'm curious and my memory may be fuzzy but I feel like there's been times when Zubac gets off to slow starts and he doesn't recover had a slow start in that first half he's recovered he's three for three Clippers have 5 Second Chance points here in the first 6 minutes or so of the quarter and are just kind of whittling away what was a lead as large as 14 well but Zubac too which was really good he was really active he was hard to block box out he wasn't standing in one play so hence he was able to get two offensive rebounds one for the putback and you love that kind of activity from the big Bel five-point game Irving with another tough shot rebound vacuumed in by Harden Maxi Kleber is out there for Dallas slippers look to attack Jones in the corner for three battles for the loose ball and it's tapped over to Gafford Klay Thompson found the range late in the second quarter to help that lead go to 14 gives it up to ca now Gafford not a threat from out there Thompson is CBA strong drive and a nice swipe there by Derrick Jones Jr goes out of bounds it'll stay with Dallas Jim mentioned a double double for Zubac Clippers are 12 and six zo does that tyo looking on his family is here said he loves these kind of series especially in great Cities Dallas certainly is that Marshall straight away for three it's good and it stops the bleeding for Dallas and the lead swells back to now nine well that's pretty good defense too by the CLI they were right in Naji Marsallh's face keep in mind n n is like 68 so he's able to get that shot up and over my public school MTH is off it's an 8 to 0 lead Norman fumbling around in the paint nying to shoot in trouble lucky get pass that to harden going to have to bail him out hesitation three no rebound ful boy it is like The Hunger Games below the bucket here tonight a lot of contact Gafford whistle foul they will count the basket as well no no no no no they wipe it away they say it's on the floor yes first two now going to Two Shots Dr James nay Smith not sure thought this would be I'm sure he said this is a non-con sport but I wonder what made him go to the peach bastard but why the of all the things you could create and use call a welder are they not around and yeah I mean plenty of weldi but why the why the basket you know the peach basket itself I love to to next time you walk by the grave I want you to go and really tune into that the thing that you have that you do you know with Ghost and ask him that question like of all things why did you choose the peach basket I will tell you that the original rules of basketball are there in Lawrence it's if you're a basketball fan it really is a mustsee a game at Allen Fieldhouse Harden who nearly well he's recruited to go to Kansas when he was maybe 12 or 13 when his older brother was playing quarterback achil Roberson Harden chose wisely at Arizona State 438 to play here in this third quarter turnover Dallas Clippers Trail by nine dun gets around Gafford creates the contact finds Coffey in the corner Coffey did not take a single shot in that first half he's got 32 in his last two games meanwhile dun has two threes in the quarter and it's cut back down to a six-point lead we come up up on the four-minute Mark here in the third and Chris Dunn had his legs up underneath him on that shot the other one's been a little short I thought he had a little bit more bounce and spring and he's able to not get the much needed three for CPP Marshall he's really looked good here tonight spoon feeds got count it and a foul yeah it's a different Naji Marshall it's the one that before the sickness kind of got a hold of him his energy is there he's springy look he's getting by his Defender now he's either making a shot or now he's making a play talked about times when said in the first half when Luka hasn't played when Naji has had some really good games for this Mavericks team got to figure somebody to come off the floor here I remember in the rules of basketball only five players on the floor when I read that that document they have it like you know how they have the Mona Lisa they've got it like kind of behind screens and you can't flash photography so it doesn't get hit by the sunlight it's it's that way as well there they've got a great presentation for it at one of the many people call it the Harvard of Lawrence there University of Kansas my degree may be honorary I'm not sure yeah real in the corner no and it just so so unready for that Miss as all of us were his Coffey's been a sniper this year just goes right off his hands and out of bounds yeah g that thing came like a range Miss he eat Gafford didn't even know how to rebound that he he couldn't get his hands up quick enough to get the rebound fortunate for us we got to see if James can make something happen here something out of nothing no big rebound there by Washington 337 to play Clippers have landed some punches but Washington and the Mavericks have gotten up off the floor Gafford has been a big reason why monster finish and Another Second Chance effort here for Dallas 17 Second Chance points that's two above their season average which I mentioned earlier is top 10 in the league Zubac posting on Gafford had his way with him back in the playoffs when these two matched up he wisely get the ball out of his hands Norman attacks hangs wild shot big finish by Norman it's 7061 Mavericks Norman five for 15 Washington off the window no rebound Harden Porter Jr now brings it the other way weaving in and out of traffic screeching halt knocks it down in the paint where else we're back to a seven-point game go some great fight great energy here for the Clippers in this third quarter Washington lobs the ga for Too Tall loose ball taken by Harden 223 to play in the third tough pass for Porter Jr he's able to recalibrate they go to Zubac Marshall flirts with a double Zubac finds Norman Fields it low shoots it high and misses everything bizarre night from above the arc from one of the League's best three-point Shooters it happens he's one for eight Grimes hit hard no whistle timeout Clippers 7263 158 to play Clippers have done a really good job on with Kyrie Irv now he's missed some open shots I think for the most part the defense is has been solid of course kyri to Tak some tough contested shots that time just the side of Zubac there kind of altered the shot and Chris Dunn the end up one-onone making it tough and despite that too you would think that if you get a tying Irving four for 16 no Luka D do you say okay that's pretty good we we should be right there well it's a second CH chance points for Dallas at 17 and then us turning the ball over again Brian talked about it 12 turnovers only eight points off of it but that means that you're not you haven't gotten shots up at the rim and you sometimes even when we've had a little momentum by giving it up it kind of breaks that momentum as well we's see what the Clippers can do here with the final two minutes of the third they did land some body blows they're down by nine Mo Bamba is out there for Zubac Bamba struggled a little bit in that first half and those struggles continue great defense by Marshall takes it to the house and Thunders it down again that's that's one of those turnovers where it goes back to the decision maker he wanted to get the ball to James which is right but if you can't get it to him you better off holding a few seconds longer finding someone else maybe you take some time off the clock but you don't turn it over Bamba will try another three same result rebound goes to Porter Jr Bamba inside high percentage no Marshall Dinwiddie attacks on Batum I almost feel like Batum allows you to get around him because he's got those long arms and he's so clever hard a transition three oh it's good for James Harden he's got 18 7466 and the Clippers just keep hanging around here I'm telling in Dallas with this squad here they're going to give you a chance okay it is different if they were light out shooting lights out and I'd be like it's going to be tough for the Clippers to get back into again see another opportunity but we got to take advantage of it right here Brian Clippers get the ball to start the fourth and a two for one opportunity here Bamba gives to harden Harden the floater in and out it was halfway down for Harden rebound goes back to Dallas 5 Seconds separate the two timers Clippers do have a foul to give and so to the Mavericks Den Wy gets around Harden met by Coffey one to shoot in the corner to Marshall not going to get it off great defense by the Clippers yeah 3.6 seconds left plenty of time to get a good look at this you cut this down to a two possession game heading into the forth shooting 37% from the field field you're giving yourself a chance 66 points scored only for the Clippers they scored 68 in the second half on Thursday it's just one of those nights it happens but it hasn't affected their defense Porter junr full steam ahead from the line to the Lane blocked by Gafford R it all the way still Clippers down just eight we head to the fourth 7466 the I thought Bo it's going to be a challenge I don't care if the Clippers were 100% healthy why the Memphis Grizzlies are up next Clippers will travel there tomorrow for a Monday night game for having a few days off going through Christmas the Clippers have given themselves a chance take a look at the West you look at the Clippers at 16 and 12 Lakers Nuggets Timberwolves Suns Warriors I want you to in your mind take off the best player of each of those teams then contact me and let me know know what you think that record would be cuz that's what's happened with the Clippers who are fifth in the west without Kawhi Leonard the job they've done win loser draw here tonight outrageously good they picked up a win on this road trip if I'm being brutally honest I wanted one out of three Clippers have put themselves in a position to be competitive here in the fourth and it starts with free throws from Norman Norman Good Start get out get a foul enor struggling we talked about the shooting you know this evening and only five for 16 one for eight but he is 4 for four from the free throw line just pointing it out that the braids are still in their gym and he's letting people know he didn't wear a hat for the first time in all the games this year these are things that we keep track of on the Clipper broadcast hey Steph Curry's coming to into a dome speak of the next home game it's the 27th don't miss it Clippers stick of Epic West Coast rematch tickets go to clippers.com tickets I'm telling you if you haven't been to a game get to this game if you are thinking about it if you're on holiday it's a Friday night in La Steph Curry the Warriors always a big draw the atmosphere is going to be off the charts and the wall is going to be a factor B there i' I've even scheduled my mother to get to that game that's how my mother's going to be there well sitting together Lively inside 7667 actually that was a well drawn up play live he was able to slip to get us the attention even with Kyrie struggling with his shooting he drew even fading Porter Jr able to get to a spot got to return to favor of Kyrie hitting his two Porter two Porter was able to get his two Porter with 11 Off the Bench he's been very good offensively here tonight Kyrie Bamba helps Kyrie doesn't seem to care fires it up and and great players make tough shots Kyrie doing that here that's just his fifth made shot he has 12 and it's a 7869 lead for Dallas but the scary part about a guy like Kyrie he may not shoot well but he'll hit shots at the right time or the wrong time for us and tough pass but good catch by Bamba but you know what I mean with Kyrie is like he can struggle all night and hit two to three of the toughest shots at the time that Dallas needs it not us well you'll never relax with him on the FL never doesn't matter what he's shooting Grimes after a strip by the Clippers knocks down a three 10-point Maverick lead you know also too those strips were going our way leading to fast breaks in the last game not this one but I tell you what Porter junr is doing everything he can to kind of keep and give the clips an opportunity to get in this but then you give it right back and it's five on four on the backside and grind's able to catch and shoot and knock it in Clippers traing Twos for threes can't happen and now the lead back to 11 for Dallas plenty of time remains but the Clippers have found their offensive wind a little bit here in this second half can it continue Norman around lightly to the rim reverses it and lays it in 18 for Norman Norman and that's good having that peripheral vision cuz he saw where PJ Wasington was coming down the lane and was going to try to take that left side of the basket away so he reversed it on the opposite side Grimes a feeli good three whistle foul free throws coming an overzealous effort there by Kevin Porter Jr third but you got to have the sense and feel of the game you get by one opponent there's PJ Washington there able to reverse Quentin Grimes was kind of in between and when you're in that in between say should I help should I not yeah yeah yeah not a good thing for him better thing for us that he didn't come over and Norm got to First a three for Grimes he's been terrific tonight nice pick up for Dallas even getting to the finals they did a wonderful job of trying to figure out how they could compete with a Boston team should they get back to the finals three-point shooting was a bit of an issue for them last year they were a midlevel three-point shooting team coming into the game on Thursday they were top five Bamba takes a seat meanwhile Kyrie iring talking to his old boss tyou on the sidelines you know what's interesting about Quentin grms is that seemed like he's a really good fit at this teene and maybe angling something different because he turned down a contract extension in October from the Mavs and maybe that's some leverage play to see what else is out there in the marketplace so figure out what that is future Clippers goes small here Norman attacks but misses at the iron it's a good look and now Kyro Irving backfield away it's a three in transition for Irving he felt it was off but it's Coffey that comes away with a loose ball and he leads the charge Norman Porter Jr strides to the rim a whistle stops the clock with 50 to play here in the fourth in that last you know shot that that Norman had he missed it but he never had control of it in his left hand so even with the contested shot not having control that layup he's close to the rim but he didn't have the touch he needed to L softly off the backboard to to complete the play Junior thought he was going to get a trip to the line I did too the way Pat freyer kind of held his hand in the air waiting for the ball to drop shot did not go in it's a side line inbound here for the Clippers trailing by 12 the time is now given how the offense has been overall in this game now that said rppers are four of five here on the floor Norman finds another scene Lively in Pursuit blocks it pass his length right there I mean my goodness man a second-year player though I mean he is a standout Washington in the corner for three it's a tough one 9075 the Clippers had it down to seven just moments ago Dallas trying to pull away with in the fourth in here on KTLA 90 to 75 trailing one of 15 games we have brought you brought you some preseason games but on the way next right here on KTLA we are headed to Phoenix Arizona that's in January a couple of games there in February OKC in March and again Dallas will round out our broadcast schedule in April now I want to make one comment I went back to our broadcast when we were in Boston and Jimmy remember said I was going to like spend maybe some holiday cheer with you on this trip and excuse me and Brian he did not want to do any holiday cheering with me have some eggnog he said no eggnog I don't in my neighborhood we don't do egg that ain't that's what you said that that ain't part of the the ritual I am a little concerned for David because Jim you're not going to see each other for 6 weeks oh Porter Junior next coming out of a timeout I'm concerned about David's wellbeing will you promise US the viewers our broadcast team that you will check in to David who has spent many nights going on eBay looking for things signed by you pricing them out Irving straight on for three in and out rebound backt nicely by Kleber right into Grimes who may not be the leading scorer tonight but boy as he made a lot of plays including one that was not intended for him no but it was it was the offense rebound that allowed him to have the play once again you know the MAV just a little bit quicker to those loose balls 5050 balls H and then they're able to capitalize off of it too dun hit a couple of Threes tonight give them a hat trick it's a big one 9280 trying to keep the Clippers hopes alive here with 730 to play plenty of time remains done nine points here tonight and a mountain of headaches for everyone he's guarded Good Help by D right there with Kyrie but somebody's open told you it's Grimes and he's been terrific from above the arch Grimes is now three for four from distance and the Mavericks after really struggling are now shooting 38% on 12 of 31 from three Porter Jr knocks it down not much of a three-point shooter at this point of the season but puts that one down he's got 18 wa now you got to pick your poison because the last double team on Kyrie opened it up for Quentin grinds on the weak side where it was a two-on one so good defense by Coffey you know and Grimes too knocking down the shot which we'll see this and Porter Jr knocks it down this what Lukas said Lukas said that he can Quentin Grimes can even be a better player more intrical on their offense because he's one of the better catch and shoot players that he's played with three for four right now now from behind the line we have a a Coffey has been hit with a te he was unfiltered with the officials 641 to play not sure what he's so I think the official um Coffey said something and I think the official so this watch here gives him a little that's nothing that's a little push that's terrible he said something maybe to the bench a little bit but I think that the official right there thought that or assumed or whatever it was that whatever was directed was directed towards him cuz I I could hear what re's lips from what he was saying to air that was great defense by Coffey and pass inside Dallas has her hands on the wheel here in Texas 9883 626 to play here in the fourth dun explodes on Kleber Norman pump F on a three lets it Fly it's good it's about time if you ask Norman Norman he second in nine attempts he's got 21 have you ever done that in internal just you might not see it physically but inside I'm sure Norman felt that way cone misses follows his Miss Second Chance points will be the undoing for the Clippers tonight 186 Norman whistle will send him to the line the Clippers come in here at 16 and 12 in a tough 541 here if they want to get back into the game that's it 16 and 12 there's a lot of congratulations I think a lot of way to goes to to be doled out the coaching staff getting the players to buy into defense the players buying into defense how about the front office pivoting when they knew Kawhi Leonard wouldn't be back right away they they saw the Paul George was not going to come back they pivot into defense they have a game plan and and last and certainly not least and this one won't surprise anybody but Steve Balmer how about building a$2 billion Arena and signing off on letting a multi-time All-Star walk knowing that it wasn't part of the plan right now and it wasn't going to win you a championship for the next two years you're kind of keeping your powder dry so to speak but in the meantime Fielding an extremely competitive picking up a win on this road trip was massive Kyrie Irving trying to put the finishing touches on the Clippers Kleber for three Harden with a rebound Norman steps into a transition triple and he knocks it down hey don't shovel him yet 510 to play in the game and this Clipper team one thing they are very resilient and for employee number 24 doesn't take a lot right out the clips cut this lead down to n Porter Junior 8 for 11 two for four from behind the three-point line 18 points I mean doing a little bit of everything getting to a spot you know the patent the step back and then you sleep I get your back door knocked in I talked about those three-pointers two for four why that's important is because third game with multiple threes in the past four shooting about 38% in in December and now that's coming off of shooting 18% in October and November from three so the Improvement as he's more comfortable Brian has been there good to see we needed it this evening Parton is at the line because as we are going into breaks aie Marshall was saying something I believe in the direction of Amir Coffey right in front of Pat freyer They teed him up so now it's it's an eight-point game with a long way to go if I'm being very honest I'd be a little nervous if I were Dallas now they've been through the ringer before but letting a team hang around that the Clippers are right here get a stop Thompson picked up by Zubac picks up his dribble now it's Kyrie away from the ball whistle offensive foul we're going the other way 453 to play in the game and it's a 192 Affair yeah and Clippers did a good job of kind of zoning up the defense and not allowing the one-on-one to happen with Zubac on Klay Thompson and Klay right there impedes the progress of one Chris Don hence causing the offensive foul Clippers nine of 11 here on the fourth Norman accelerates crashing through Defenders a whistle and a foul he'll go to the line for two it's the fourth foul on Dallas Clippers with just one team foul with 441 to play in the game but this is a tough action because you go to the strong WR side but you're going to bring Norman off of the right side which is the weak side off of a screen but then as he continues to dribble you got Zubac rolling down the lane so that puts the defense in the precarious situation and the shiftiness of Norman Norman to able to get downhill down Lane and pick up the foul first of two uses every ounce of iron which is needed something times it's not clean like some of my putts but you know it rolls in there and still counts for that triple B ah yeah we try to keep those snowmen away from the card 11 to2 run it's a two-possession game 435 to play Clipper offense has found a Groove here in the fourth you know the ball is going on this end of the Court Kyrie's going to make something happen he draws the crowd is he Thompson open for three and Norman got he had the decision to make right there he was late he was hanging around with with d witty and he didn't want to give it up but that was Klay Thompson at the top good quick strike by the Clippers excellent pass there by Dunn 405 to play 10396 go back to this elbow play with Kyrie okay cuz it's giving them some opportunities here you see him on the elbow Gafford seven a shoot not much of a playmaker didn't what he's going to have to be it's a deep three and a foul on Normal Norman you have the Mavericks in a tough spot late in the clock it's but it's a tough tough situation because Norman Norman with di is not going up he's going over the screen see right here now you're in trail position when you're in trail position and maybe didn't wit he kicking that leg out but see we missed the opportunity right there to look at it cuz we didn't have the challenge but that was a tough one right there anytime you're trailer like think you try to fight over the top right it's hard to get back cuz the offensive players is smart enough to go up for the shot knowing that there's going to be contact I'll save the Clipper bench I feel like that would have been unsuccessful you think so I do cuz it's a natural motion of his leg he didn't actually kick it out it was a natural motion right I didn't feel like it was exaggerated for sure but I tell you what if you had the challenge you would want to take it in that situation to see for it could get overturned scores and stops in that order Norman misses on a three Lively with a rebound three and a half to play in this one Mavericks by 10 Den Woody just three for 12 from the field he created a lot of contact with that elbow it's a late whistle and it goes against Dallas Dinwiddie he saying review it getting awful animated with the officials Jon kid says let's chat he's going to challenge 321 to play in the game and we know why yeah we know why and I love the attempt by Norman here see that inside illegal contact by Dy grabb arm this has been overturn to the defensive Foul Play will resume Dallas possession on the side so did you see how Pat was leaning on on the when he was doing it cuz you see him I I didn't he was more leaning forward you know why I was talking to him about the camera see you live in when you live in LA you understand photos and video and how to look so he leaned more into to give you more of a presence interesting see look look look see see I'm inviting you into what I'm doing I want to calm me see you feel me the softness in his eyes oh man I killed myself sometimes man off the side of the backboard loose ball goes to Dunn flippers down 10 but Dunn steps out of bounds boy the unforced errors to close the second quarter were a real problem that's just a hustle play there by dun well but you know here's the hustle and but this is goes back to who this Clipper team really is okay which is Oh I thought his heel was up right there I agree with that right in front of the officials though we just gave Pat some love and he does that to us but our margin of error when we're having nights like this or a turnover then when he gets it right back you know what I mean our margin of eror we can't overcome the self-inflicted wounds as well as other teams who the roster looks a little bit different and can do that Irving with six to shoot picked up by Harden the step back long two rebound tapped out of bound no saved than your Parton here C the Clippers 239 to play they need a magic lamp in all three wishes and Dereck Lively says I've got your lamp right here Irving the other way Clippers down 10 I tell you what Lively he may be the MVP at this game for the mavers just on everything he's been able to do with the offensive rebounds block shots 11 rebounds Washington in the corner ahead of the horn two minutes to go 10-point game we've seen crazier things happen but when that happens it's awful tough 16 turnovers but as Jim has said it's not the volume it's the timing of those turnovers and a lot of them led to momentum in the second quarter for Dallas and it's helping Dallas pull away from the Clippers late in this one the these two teams don't play again until April it'll be very interesting to see where things are for both teams yeah yep and the Clippers trending obviously in the right way I mentioned it earlier even with the loss here tonight they'd be 16 and 13 and on just pure speculation from what we've seen what we've read K uh Kawhi Leonard is around the corner I felt and was concerned that Kawhi would come back to a team that was four five maybe six games under 500 it doesn't seem like that is going to be the case and it's just going to be such a race in the final 50 or so games kaai on the trip for the first time this year what the the good is that he will be back and I'm not going to say the bad the challenge is going to be now you have to reset roll with Kawhi coming back in the lineup offensively and defensively in particular on the offensive side because to this point of the season you know this Clippers team by talking about being 16 and 13 29 games you didn't you got into a rhythm how you rotate how you what your playing rotations are how you used offensively in Klay Thompson to KN coming back a lot of that change and it's going to change again Brian cuz he's going to be on Ministry sttion at the beginning and then once he really plays full time everything the rotations everything change but it's the best problem that could ever have with this team and I know that they won the game without Luka and Kyrie on Thursday but if you want me to be very honest I feel like they have earned every single Victory this year and it's just a great culture and a great mindset that Kawhi Leonard in time will be returning to den witty and the finishing touches here for Dallas Clippers did all they could to hang round despite not having their fast ball for sure and Dallas also didn't have their fast ball Kyrie Irving 6 for 25 but I agree with you 100% the MVP of this game is Dereck Lively Klay Thompson hit some big shots as well but only took nine of them Jason kid going to empty out his bench it's interesting here for Dallas they had a we had a pretty brutal stretch with a lot of games and not a lot of time but some of those games were at home for for the Clippers the Mavericks coming into tonight 17- 10 and they' had 15 Road games at one point in time played 13 of 17 away and yet I bring up that record they're 17 and 10 with those games tough opponents on the road this is a team that certainly feels like in their mind and and I certainly understand it they can absolutely come out of the West again and they're a better team than they were a year ago what did you know this too schedule and when you play a team matter so much on the backing you talk about the number of home games they're going to have healthy Dallas Mavericks team late in the year playing against some teams that are struggling may have some injuries all in the Maverick's favor to close it out you know with some momentum going into the playoff Jason kid takes over they go to the Conference Finals they miss the playoffs they go to the NBA finals but I mean it doesn't hurt to have kind I mean it shout out to my man Nico Harrison for making the moves last year by getting live I mean Gafford by getting PJ Washington you know making those necessary moves well we'll see where these two teams are in the standings the next time they meet it'll be in April Clippers meanwhile come in here and they split it and that is a win to this reporter for sure but the final score here tonight 113 to 97 Mavericks over the Clippers
