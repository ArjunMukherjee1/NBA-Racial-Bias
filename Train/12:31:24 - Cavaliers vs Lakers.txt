 they really did remarkable start for the Cavs as they put up to 40 at a 24 second by uh clock malfunction clock hasn't started yet no it got tipped so never well so we're 7 seconds in if that is going to hold the 24 second clock is at 20 and the 7 seconds on the off of the game clock and here we go Jarrett Allen he is one of the two players that have played in every game so far this year there's Darius down goes off the Lakers out of bounds it's going to remain with the Cav we'll see if they can keep it going it's not an easy schedule though and half of the games in that 14 will be against the East and there's Mobley the former Trojan going all the way to score and that first that first B way too easy I mean he got the steppo and Rui too easily and nobody there to contest Evan didn't have a great game the other night when they beat Golden State in fact that was last tonight this is the second of a backto back for the Cavaliers but they've got so much momentum going for them these players cannot wait to get onto the floor that's an air ball by Anthony Davis and then they drop it out of bounds yeah only 1.9 on the shot clock so now the Lakers are in real matter this is a third of a four game Road Trip ab and he'll go to the line and shoot two what you don't like if you're the Cavaliers is to for the Cavs back earlier in the season well the Lakers have obviously attacked the paint more 122 win over Sacramento and I think some of you realize it but if you don't that's the highest scoring regular season game this year for the Lakers that 132 that they put up the other night against Sacramento they had 132 in an overtime game also this year Mitchell for three spider well he's just very very fluid you know they ran that play He said screen and get screened by m and ends up wide open first Lakers know all about him beginning his career in Utah LeBron for three well short going to be taken out by Jarrett Allen LeBron officially missed the last game due to an illness so he's missed what three games here in the last couple of weeks all the way now to mle good ball fake on Davis going to be right back to Wade it's Dean Wade it's down to four on the shot and Mitchell's got it Wade open but that's good ball movement because right at the buzzer they got probably the best shot they could have gotten and Mobley hits a three at the other end LeBron what an outlet from the back court well LeBron had Donovan Mitchell Garden him so he took him right to the Box just threw it over the top for the easy Deuce now Cleveland they've won seven in a row 11 out of their last 12 they had a four game winning streak earlier too oh that's going to be three free throw and the fouls on Rui oh you just don't like this best start in franchise history and their longest win streak in franchise history how about this right now from car's Jr Mitchell now one out of two with still the third free throw to follow now this Cleveland offense to uh the second best scoring offense but when you look at the numbers where they rate offenses they are number one they're also the best field goal shooting team excuse me and the best three-point shooting team what impresses me is not their numbers is their letters I mean they they the W's they get in the W I don't care in the A+ you want to grade them every night how you get them they are 11 and three away from home too they are a crazy 17- one at home and they have not lost they have not lost to a western conference to the Atlanta Hawks and they came in backto back games in a home and home situation LeBron's going to try another three that one dips in comes out goes back in again how they freed up LeBron on that play but he was wide open but they bring it right out of the net and come down and score G loves that one-hander off the dribble that's a great play by Jarrett Allen well he read it he wasn't back filling at all was able to just Elevate Mitchell catch shoot no but all's there to tap it no again they've got great size Cleveland but it's chased down by Austin Reaves in the corner they've got two Rim protectors out in the starting lineup and Reaves has it poked away Stripped Away turnover time and it's taken by the Cavaliers Mitchell who's been very active here in the first three minutes and he's fouled again every single night you're going to get something with LeBron cuz he's going to go when he say seven more years come on it's going to last forever oh he said he could possibly go a lot of people are too the defense and the offense the two-way action that Dorian Finney Smith can of course they had to get their physicals cleared and and everything and they are in uniform and now they're good to go tonight we'll see if Shake gets in also shake is playing in there what six a team already and there fifth in a couple of years kind of like we'll tell it if it's true I like it but it's really interesting yeah here is Davis do you know what his real name is don't yes okay nice Lefty by Anthony Davis cuz Jarrett Allen is a good Defender especially when he's uh protecting the rim like that but sh did say nobody ever calls me by my real name here underneath and it's over to Jarrett Allen the turn the score he shoots more jump hooks in the from the center position I think anybody in the league James open again for three got it that's two threes for LeBron James you see LeBron shaking his head it's almost like they're saying they're daring him to shoot the three and he's saying oh no oh no 561 30 point games for LeBron that's one behind MJ all time so that's a little bit of a sub block tonight again there was the bounce pass for Austin he tried to straight pass and deflected for a turnover second Laker turnover Mitchell comes up short going to go right to him though Mitchell Cross Court Dean Wade for Mitchell in low this is M it's a big man move is it well he got mismatch with Austin Reaves there's nothing Austin could do defensively and M knew it born in San Diego played ball at Rancho Chris in and Tula and then start at nearby USC one bounce for rhythm but now he goes over to R who's been on a heater Lately from outside and he throws it away equal opportunity look at Garland Bo just fired it from 30 what you just saying look at Garland firing from 30 here's Rie that's good ball fake he goes all the way hangs on the rim gets it back blocked by Allen Jarrett Allen was right there to reject how did R miss the first yeah he had a gim me it scene at the other man another missed layup Allen's going to control it tap it they yeah two on the floor Dean Wade is going to tackle all the way to score and one as he goes down to the hardwood and it's 20 to 12 against the Cavs to 282 points per game has at least 20 and 22 of his tree to the land few years back they finally got a title there number one pick in the NBA oh 22 years ago can we get our first look at Dorian  Finney Smith yeah he is in the game wearing number 17 he's got Foxy's old number number seven here's Christie underneath good ball Movement by the Lakers slam dunk by Davis well they put Anthony Davis in the corner and it opened up the paint area and when Allen help left him open Benny Smith has been starting for Brooklyn of course they got him for this end of the floor he'll give you 10 to 12 a night probably on the offensive end if you're looking for an average but here he is doubling up and a foul is going to be called as he doubled up with Christin again no no I'm saying that for a reason and I'll tell you when you're done a note in his locker with kind of five things to focus standpoint that's great the versatility the switching lineups he can do he can defend centers he can defend wings but just being him is what JJ wants the most yeah I'm not going there I just want to say you're a social media person you can get on his Instagram doo1 10 and I'm sure he would love to have more people join his Instagram I'm sure but has nothing I'm tell do with us calling him dodo I'm not calling him that his name is Doran that's what I call him so I'm saying that's his nickname to all the guys on the team name is Dorian yeah Dorian Finney Smith Dorian Finney Smith yeah was a one1 of a second on the shot clock so what do you think the Lakers are going to do well they're going to I don't know are they're going to try try to try to tap it that's the only you can do tap and no you can't get it with both hands I don't think you can do it with one hand that's about as close as you can do it and still not get it allow it there's no way you could have got the second point two is basically what they might think about on the outside that shot is by LeVert who's having himself a great year off the bench Caris LeVert there's the pressure on the offensive glass that Jarrett Allen provides and it forced the Lakers to touch it last so led the bench with 16 points against the Lakers back on October the 30th Strus we did not see him the first time around and he knocks it down from three and won a four-point opportunity for Strus injury in a Ste and he's still shaking off the cobwebs his fourth game on his return this is game number five started 70 for Cleveland last year and the Lakers are down 2714 as you said a repeat of when we saw them in Cleveland at least so far this is a really good basketball team and they are showing it flexing their muscles right now on the break and and two free throws coming all right entering your LA area nonprofit to win the Lakers Youth foundation's January you grant now finalists will be selected and featured on lakers.com where fans will vote for the winner of the $7,500 U Grant now to nominate your organization visit lakers.com they've got four guy or three guys off the bench on the court so let's see if the Lakers can do anything you can see how Dorian is uh he's looking around he's not comfortable at all yes he's obviously in his first game with the Lakers CU he doesn't really know the feel comfortable being himself well Austin's got three of the Lakers six turnovers and that shot goes down I mentioned that because on the great side of things reev stew is coming off with that 16 assist game here the night against Sacramento he's been doing a good job of running the offense leading in Garland that's off Target rebound to Anthony Davis Anthony Davis for the Lakers six the NBA in rebounds Dalton Knecht seems to be getting his rhythm back that one hits the front of the rim now out of bounds last touched by Cleveland chrisy Finney Smith and Knecht on the floor oh he got his man in the air but Allen did a good job not fouling but the first points as a Laker on a auto Slam by  Finney Smith they didn't go the whistle because Anthony Davis actually jumped into the defensive POS players position to clean it up and Dorian averages about four and a half rebounds a game he was playing close to 29 minutes in Brooklyn he had a huge rooll there now of course D and Maxwell Lewis will be wearing a net uniform remember dowo was an Allstar there in 2019 Reaves puts on a little dance and he gets fouled himself up a little bit you know six plus Seasons with the Mavs before he was traded to Brooklyn and me Kyrie deal let's check in with Mike yeah so steu to your point about dor Can Crash from the weak side basically uh with a free run because guys are so worried about Anthony Davis now that again is not an offensive Rebound in that case it wasn't quite that type of play but that's something you get with Anthony Davis yeah absolutely I mean anytime one player commands two something's available for the others Mobley on a good play by Strus who bounced it to him and the dive that time by Mobly for two nice looking play by Strus Davis on the perimeter three and a half to play first quarter Cleveland up by 11 they've led by as many as 15 Lakers have not LED in the contest boy there just harassing Davis and then the foul the Lakers come in at a night tied with Denver six spot in the west three full ahead of the 11th spot Reaves leans in for yet another bucket that's the kind of play that will get the Cavaliers out of that zone though Austin getting into the the middle easily at the other end three-point shot they are relying a lot more on the three this year Cleveland it seems to be the trend around the league but numbers way up now look at this move by Reaves in the paint spinning and scoring that's what he's been able to do I mean and even more so this year is get into the inside and create some really opportunities for himself and his teammates and Mitchell off Target so the Lakers get a chance to have a little run of their own to get back a lot closer hook pass  Finney Smith can't hit the three he's been shooting over 40% from downtown is Dorian and that's on the floor you can put it in total perspective he gets at least those numbers on the latest episode of Backstage Lakers what do you think we have and Reaves Golf Wednesday you said his name so loud you startled him and he missed a free throw it was my fault of course I know I'm sorry he heard me all the way up here really did they hushed it it was like a library next dead ball we're going to see Shake Milton and we're going to see him right now on the offensive end six teams in seven seasons for shake and believe it or not his fifth team since the start of last year seems improbable but that's exactly what it is and here he is in the corner Shake It Go ahead Shake said I don't need much time I can get comfortable shooting the ball that's a little Shake Rattle and Roll to start his Laker career from the the corner so Milton's got a three we saw him play a couple of good games against the Lakers in a Philly uniform yes as we recall Nick Lakers steal it here they come 3128 after being down by 15 and then they turn it over for the seventh time in the quarter so going small so to speak they got Rui LeBron  Finney Smith Milton and and Knecht out on the floor again Jackson Hayes we expect to see tonight mold's underneath comes up short they battle around and here come the Lakers and a 14-2 run Milton who just hit a three ball movement finds Rui to tie it he cannot and the rebound let's see if they battle amongst themselves they do for a moment then strews comes out with it Mitchell puts an easy move on Knecht for two one of his Pat moves is that crossover the game he's only made one tonight so he's just five behind the league leaders LeBron on the outside with five to shoot LeBron wanders in off the glass for two not an easy shot not easy at all I mean did a great job of utilizing the clock as well but that was a tough possession for the Lakers and bronze the First on either side in double digits right now he's got 10 all 33 games the other one is Jarrett Allen and he'll shoot another one coming up playing defense at the other end a four-point game with Lakers trying to work for the last shot they should be able to get just about all of it yeah Cleveland number one in field goal shooting number one in three-point shooting bottom 10 in free throw shooting they Tails out of that one right shot clock is off LeBron with Mitchell in front of him is really working Donovan isn't he tries that one rebound Wade and the quarter is going to end here in Los Angeles if you're just joining us Cleveland jumped out by 15 underneath whoa Vinny Smith could not get complete control of that and then it's going to be called a travel Dorian  Finney Smith crosscourt goes to Rui Hachimura shake Milton is also on along with Knecht and LeBron here's the number one pick for the Lakers DOL Knecht out of Tennessee and the L he's really good there in that little midrange right around the key that's what I've said I mean he's just not solely a three-point shooter not even close i' like for him to expand his game and show that he's got other things to offer he's coming off of an 18-point game LeBron play a little defense denies Mitchell Milton gives it now to LeBron LeBron James is the quarterback on this possession right off the fingertips of Knecht they're playing a little two-man game a minute in here in quarter number two and the Lakers are down by only two LeBron here he goes he got tied up and it's going to belong to Cleveland it's the Jazz last Monday a season High 20 points gr somebody need to be attended to somebody's bleeding and they're they're cleaning the Dr in the Box tomorrow that's if the Lakers are victorious against the Cavaliers tonight strs catch shoot that rainbow is out Target and LeBron was the speed here he comes going downhill LeBron James throws up the left hand it's not going to go and Cleveland has it going the other way four on three Mobley now to Strus down the middle all the way goes Niang he was the trailer early offens like transition sometimes you just can't match up and you give up easy Hoops Cam's going to try a three Cam's actually shot the two very very well last seven eight games three is still not really there knocked Away by Knecht they were looking for Mobley 3632 the last five out of six so things have turned around nicely for them as we roll into 2025 Niang who just scored at The Rim trying to move on LeBron and it's going to be a battle underneath by Shake Milton yeah he was battling with Mobley took it right away from him Shake now to Knecht LeBron's going to hold on to it back to the basket Rui has it poked away going right back to LeBron who now directs some traffic eight to shoot so he's got to get into his action how about just shooting the three oh Rui had the rebound still has the rebound but didn't get the basket Lakers have missed a couple of bunnies Lakers right now shooting 38% as a team Mobley is underneath look at renish all over it Reddish causing some problems and helping him miss that shot that was good activity by cam because he was really at a disadvantage now it's five on four as Mobley is very tardy coming back to the other end could be a block or an offensive foul 50/50 they call it a block very fortunate for Rui I thought he was going to do the side step to the middle who we have seen already tonight he is second in the NBA kind of a cliche term Lakers already have 10 second chance points just doing some work just doing some work on the offensive Second Chance opportunities Mitchell working on Reaves here's Ty Jerome who had a great first two months of the year Donovan Mitchell knocks down the three on the year he's a 412 percenter had a 24 Seven assists game last meeting against the Lakers that was in Cleveland they won by 24 in that contest LeBron Corner Knecht cat shoot weak side rebound there was Rui trying to tap it out instead now with a six-point lead it belongs to Cleveland that's knocked out of bound do it's in two now they see themselves down six and could be down more with this possession yeah and they have not LED in the game team with the best record in the NBA OKC's number two they'll meet in about a week or by the way January the eth those two teams Lakers take it away that's turnover number four for the Cavaliers LeBron terminates the dribble Reaves into the contest Austin Reaves boy look at that hesitation move what a change of pace Reaves the score he acted like he was going to come back off the screen of LeBron and the shade him and got beat because he shaded him good play by Austin Reaves again again had that the great Christmas triple double including the game winning layup Mitchell open out on top Merrill not close job by going down to get it Dalton's going to attack the rim all the way to score I mean he keeps showing everybody that he's got more International three is a different length in the NBA you tell me they have not turned it over yet here in the second quarter let's hope that that continues underneath and that's Reed just setting the table for Anthony Davis tell he where would they be we talked about LeBron and we talked about Anthony Davis but I'm tell you something Austin Reaves has something that this team needs desperately yeah he's gone next level I think here in the last month or so especially that's an offensive foul they don't call but ball Don't Lie the Lakers have it as reddish peels himself off the de Here Comes LeBron LeBron James throws it down from Reed go simple basketball that gets the crowd going here in Los Angeles and the Lakers have the lead 4139 their first of the night Dean Wade goes in and gets it as it was there for the taking Ty Jerome puts Cleveland right back out on top we talked about Second Chance opportunities there's one there as the Cav get the score Ty to benion points against Golden State with 10 it was a nice bounce back game oh count it counted and one who else he's everywhere right now I tell you has yet to try a three tonight Lakers knocked down the free throw well they're trying to playing belly up and he's showing what how defenses are at a disadvantage if you have any kind of a handle you can go by people launched from downtown and it's Darius Garland Garland I mentioned he led the team in points and their win over Golden State 11395 Golden State shot under 40% and they played really good defense did Cleveland to win that game against the lowly Warriors right now they're really having problems their loss of the Lakers was just one of many that they've had over the last month Jerome the pick Allen was right there the soft touch didn't work taken by Dalton Knecht here he comes in the attacking zone out of Christie boy things have gone well for the Lakers since they inserted Christie into the starting lineup Knecht wanders in finds reddish ball movement Christie three and the tap by Jarrett Allen here come the Cavs lob to out he's going to throw it down he's going to throw it down that's a good job of running the floor though by Jarrett Allen they got the he tapped it out hesitated for a brief moment and then just took off a in the league he has five straight double doubles against the Lakers does Jarrett Allen he missed his 19th on the Year by one rebound against Golden State Drive kick three not this time for Anthony Davis ad on the year 31% from Beyond The Arc darland likes this matchup well he did initially as he tried to get around Davis I why he liked that match up if he could blow past him but Anthony Davis kind of stayed with him off a quick 70 run into the front Court Reaves now to the right side Rui Hachimura and rolls around and Spills out heartbreak for Rui Rui is over five tonight and he came in really shooting it well Allen and almost came out on the dunk attempt they got a 90 run now for the Cavs yeah Jarrett's got 10 points so Jarrett Allen with 10 Donovan Mitchell with 12 and Rui is over five so tough start for him Reaves the CF stay in that zone reddish Up and Under block by Allan boy he's good at that isn't he he's active he's really good now the right hand side ball fake Garland doesn't have it an Anthony Davis grabs his fifth rebound for the lake show just three and a half to play here in the second quarter Cavs up 5144 reddish Reddish fires misses so the Lakers are 212% just three out of 14 from three Cavs are six out of 18 defense and easy offense for Strus mishandle by Garland and two Defenders or two offensive players almost side made it easy for chrisy to come up with the loose ball now the Lakers with an advantage in points off of turnovers doesn't happen often right now it's 11 to8 in that stat Jerome boy bodied up on oh blocked by Anthony Davis Jerome he think he was going to get away with that one here's Z re into the corner Strus is going to fire Strus is not going to get Jerome had it Austin Reaves was digging at it Jerome natal he's really good at that right there oh he didn't draw Iron but the very active as you called him Jarrett Allen has the rebound in two they don't run many things for Jarrett Allen obviously but he knows if he just works hard he's going he's out there he's going to get opportunities especially with Second Chance opportunities yeah he was a monster 207 rebound performance against the Lakers earlier and finally Rui is on the board his first field goal he did make one free throw earlier Reaves has four assists Davis with two minutes to play here in the half Strus is going to tried from this side now same result you know I mean really the shot though looked exactly the same how it kind of went in and came back out so he's over for three from three Allen's going to give it right back to Jerome on the two-man game lob to Allen he had to come back down to get it but of course he's going to put it right around Anthony Davis but a first half for Jarrett Allen seven rebounds 14 points tie for game honors in the scoring Department Anthony Davis Lakers are in a real drought though offensively well they're below 40% now from the field Garland he's very aggressive throws it into a crowd fortunately for him Cleveland comes out with it this is nearly a logo well it's a l quarter 0 for nine in the second quarter down the middle goes Davis does not get the benefit of a whistle now they've got a power play going the other way five on four somebody's open it's Davis coming back on defense LeBron she gets fouled he gets fouled just need to pitch a shut out for the final 46 minutes uh 46 seconds Anthony Davis holding on to it Allen is right on him out on top 13 on the shot clock Davis open for three so he'll take it and hit it Anthony Davis Anthony Davis checks in with his first from that distance he's got 11 now is just over 20 in his career against Cleveland only two other teams he averages lower against Mitchell over Reaves that's pretty Donovan Mitchell Jarrett Allen had had the last five Cavs baskets up until Mitchell drained one Lakers are down by seven shot clock is off Brees just inside the free throw line scores you said just that's no man's land cuz the big Allen was waiting but Austin picked it up before then and that's what I call team Davis on the first possession the Lakers down by five and there's Austin Reaves going in again and once again it's Jarrett Allen the last line of defense well he made a good recovery because Austin really had a step on him one the drive but with that recovery made the block Anthony Davis cuts off Mobley who's trying to go Baseline Garland couple of big steps mle three over Davis it's perfect and that's the part of Mo's game that has really improved since he entered this league on a tear in December from three do you're absolutely right 53% this month from Beyond The Arc for Mobley Christie three of his own rebound Dean Wade over to m hit it from right there W's going to leave it for Mitchell first minute and a half here of the second half Mitchell three-point shot that bricked a little bit rebound to Christie up ahead it goes to Austin Reaves Reaves sitting on four assists four rebounds and 16 points LeBron on the left wing side in front of him is Mitchell tend to shoot LeBron with his back to the basket is he going to try to get there he was looking for Davis who was cutting down the lane and it's off the leg of M well you could see LeBron setting up Donovan Mitchell for the Spin Real Estate underneath Rui got another bucket so hold his baskets from in close if he doesn't do a little bit of a head fake no blocks that shot gar down the middle he goes that was altered by the Spectre of Davis yes just his presence yes never made a move but the shadow was there Austin got himself in trouble in the air running is Mobley Rim running all the way to score good Hustle by Mobley see how soft Mo's feet are I mean when I say soft he he runs and you can't even hear him hitting the ground Rui he throws it down with one hand so the 0 and five start from the field is long forgotten he's now three for eight has got to play some defense Darius Garland getting into the teeth of the defense for two well Darius has been their guy the last couple weeks as James misses rebound taken by Mitchell why do I say that he's been their leading score in three of the last four games and five of the last eight games Garland but there's Mitchell dipping in and out getting a hand on it was Allen now LeBron the middleman LeBron all the way he's going down he puts it up he's rejected LeBron begging for the whistle not going to get it Garland little step back in and out heartbreak taking by the Lakers Lakers have to score on his possession they are down 6557 LeBron is going to score you see how he backed Mobley completely under the rim not going to stop me that's a tough work place to get a block shot from what's Mobley 7 foot he's got what 215 in his back pocket 7t 215 oh he's heavier than 215 come on that's what he's listed at really yes he's than that I'm just going by T I know I agree with you though I agree with you here's Davis LeBron the little shovel pass for the assist and they pulled it within four knew this was going to be a battle from the beginning this Cleveland team again they will play OKC who's 26 and five in a week this should be a heck of a game here is Mitchell rolls around taken down by Davis Lakers have Portland and Atlanta coming up in a couple of nights back to back here at home AR's underneath and the Lakers are on a bit of a run which means Kenny ainson doesn't like what he sees time out birthday celebration will be tonight kind of combining that with New Year's Eve and a block by Davis couldn't save it well he stepped on the line as he was trying to save it if he hadn't stepped on the line like well let's see the ball out of bounds now to Garland for a second they do a little house cleaning yeah Garland fell right there and perspiration from the body that's a dangerous scenario for sneakers on the hardwood so the Lakers three and six against the East they've lost their last four though to the other conference catch and shoot and that is fresh snow from the right side for Strus well you know you're you're defens the guy that's guarding to go out of bounds is protecting against the layup so force him to go to his off hand don't let him come off the screen to his dominant side oh shake and bake by Christie then he went right into heavy traffic and out of bounds it goes good move by Christie but should have passed it to LeBron out of bounds LeBron Lakers by the way remember only had nine assists in the first half they have assisted on the last five buckets in this half and they've only turned it over one time since the first quarter but Strus says I don't care about any of that I've hit two threes in a row and they're coming down and when you get them in in in transition those are hard defend hard threes to defend in transition again number one team at 3o Ag and they utilize it a lot Allen rebound weak side Jarrett Allen's one rebound away from a double double make it he has it that's his 10th rebound Strus got to close out on him and finally a challenge by Strus we'll see Finney Smith newest Laker in a moment Anthony Davis right to to the rack and off the glass for two soft touch avoidance of the charge Anthony Davis who averages 26 per game on the season Allen's going to recharge it out on top to Garland we're nearly halfway through the third Garland for three what a rainbow heard me said before right-handers prefer shooting off to dribble going to their left cuz they don't have to square shoulders up he's a top 23o percentage guy in the NBA Darius Garland out of Vanderbilt Anthony Davis in very deep the double team comes Anthony Davis now in trouble Anthony Davis in trouble it's on the ground and a foul on Cleveland yeah they are making sure they surround Anthony Davis with multiple bodies with Rees Davis Christie and  Finney Smith Levert is all over him boy Caris Levert was a problem the clock was a problem too yes it was Strus catch and shoot look out Strus is lighting it up yeah look out Lakers need and get a timeout he's taking all of his shots from behind the arc do as the entire Laker team yeah I mean Strus is on a roll right now so you got to make sure you're assigned to him that you don't give him any air space and their last four baskets have been threes Knecht oh that's good play by a with the right place right time perfect for a put back rebound a good job of just spinning and being on the inside for the rebound it's a 10-point game though and the Lakers steal it so out of the timeout they get a basket and maybe another one right here Reaves controlling it we got 445 to go and they do get another one here in third quarter action as Anthony Davis takes the lob in the L real nice almost like a slip screen he did set a little bit but did a great job of rolling quickly Cleveland playing a lot of big games already this year they have defied anybody who thought that this was a a fluke it's anything but this team is for Real yeah and the more you win the more you believe in yourself and it becomes even more difficult to beat them 7769 make it 77- 72 now this is the end where they're going to have to make their stand here Strus is hanging out in the corner so stay home with him Dar behind the back bup s chy short so the Lakers have a chance for a nice run out of that timeout 7772 they're going to cut it way down if a can nail the three time out Cleveland game of runs still game of run basketball team look for their 19th win of the year you know they've won five of the last six games and four have been decided by two possessions or less who got a lot of close games lately so Niang out of the break misses so the Lakers have a chance to tie or take the lead back there have been four lead changes oh and Austin can't finish off the great move that's a nice move too W really nice you dearly want to pay that off behind the back to Strus he's got Anthony Davis in front of him so he's got to shoot it over the long arm of the law right there and he couldn't get it done now he's got the mismatch under the basket Finney Smith see that off when it left his hand he started 20 games with the Nets before the trade by the way points per game second best of dorian's career and this is the end of the floor they really hoped he helps out underneath the Mobley count it goes it doesn't go and he'll 12 and 15 points and that's great balance They're all playing about the same amount of minutes yeah yeah in fact they have six players that average double figures third 78% free throw shooter converts Shake is back into the game Milton we number 20 looks like the Zone Again by the Cavs Milton bouncing a good one today ooh just a little bit too strong Vinny Smith Takes a Tumble Mobley with the handle can hand it right off for Strus who gets fouled by Shake one thing about Strus that makes him even more after missing all those games to start the year uh he had been back for four games and had not shot it well at all so he's finally gotten all the Barnacles off all the rust off and he's playing well here this evening oh the start the stop Mitchell kind of threw it up there at the last instant yeah because he was worried about Anthony Davis yeah I'm sure he had complete control Milton for three in the corner shak's got another one shake had a lan to the basket realized that there was no so he said I'll just step back and drain the three so Shake is two for two both threes ooh they allow Niang inside to get an easy offensive rebound Levert goes around LeBron ball movement they swing it this is a good shot for them how about a great shot for them Donovan Mitchell and it found their best score the guy that leads them in that department Lakers dominating in the paint 4828 You' expect that in a close game because Cleveland dominating in threes LeBron he's going to swing it into the corner back out now for Davis Milton again that's an air ball out of a shake Milton out of s SMU seventh year in the league he had a he played against Cleveland earlier this month for Brooklyn didn't have a good game there mble just battling LeBron and he scores he did a good job of keeping two hands on the ball cuz LeBron took two swings at it swipes at and couldn't get it to free itself up Ian Mitchell each have 18 for Cleveland under a minute to play third quarter from crypto.com Arena LeBron James Knecht is right next to him so he's going to give it to D for three that glances off so Knecht from Beyond The Arc is not hit one he's 0 for four as again JJ reic called him with the top 1% of Shooters in the game but he's fall a hard times from out there Mitchell good ball f look at this pass crosscourt Strus went completely crosscourt that time and Levert conver hurs and it paid dividends as now they go back up by nine just like that and they fouled Lebron Seven threes in the quarter they are 10 and one in December closing it out here with their 12th game of the month 2.7 seconds left here in the third as the Lakers bring Austin back and take uh who's going oh Dorian Finney Smith Goes to the sideline all right you got two sevens St you can make a quick move and Reaves is going to just lean right in does not get the bounce quarter over and not a great to start the team with the most three-point Shooters it seems they are just knocking the bottom out Lakers have no answer they've been on a couple of streaks like you said though they they get right there in fact they took the lead briefly Vinnie Smith Drive kick Milton back to Knecht for to shoot up against it Dal rebound to the Cavaliers remember they played last night they dis Manel Golden State they will play again in Dallas in a couple of nights Lakers will be in Dallas next week turning is mle comes up short now LeBron with some steam here he comes across the timeline LeBron's going to go all the way or at least try it and then he gets tripped up never got the shot off though never got the shot off excuse me 12 you can't from J in the Box amazing how how often he goes to the basket that he doesn't get the whistles you know the Lakers as a team they shoot a ton of free throws it's just not LeBron every night well they've only shot 11 th far yeah it's it's a kind of an aberration this evening give credit to the cavers yep defense without foul and they've been be up on the Lakers they've been up into everybody and top 10 defense Mitchell got it Donovan Mitchell spider Mitchell he does that cross and then steps back man then he elevates on his jump shot Mitchell made his 15003 in the game last night Rui gets blocked Here Comes Cleveland defense offense Mitchell Rob underneath Mobley that got the just for the moment they're going to have to reorganize it they just trying to dig in defensively Mitchell feeling it he's feeling it all the way to an air ball he'll hear the serenade so far during this seven game streak he's been shooting 42% from Beyond The Arc tonight he's 6 for 11 he's over 50 Le backing in backing in Mitchell's there Mobley helps out now it's Shake Milton going to be too strong rebound taken by Mobley that's the you know out of the double team that shot there is a difficult shot to make 16-7 in three-pointers 17-7 in three-pointers himself nine assist in just one turnover just some of the highlights there Reaves now to LeBron let's see if the Lakers can get things going got time 9 Minutes 14 seconds that one poked from behind he's got Allen in the end LeBron with the man of the popcorn machine scores the L he just about had the ball poked away on the perimeter but he maintained possession and got to dou St can I accentuate a point you just made nine of the last 10 field goals for Cleveland have been thre that's just ridiculous nine of the last 10 makes that one dips in and comes out rebound Rui again it's out of timeouts that the Lakers have started their runs made him leaded him drive kick ball movement Reaves is open and he hits so a couple of buckets in a row for the Lakers it's a good start 9685 back to 11 Donovan Mitchell with the left hand with the left hand it's alive oh and I think he realized it too made a point to let everybody know great drive by Mitchell Reaves cross over he's going to get the whistle like he normally he does LeBron doesn't get him but and the players make a shot like that hey Laker fans don't miss your chance to catch the Lakers this holiday season yeah we're still in the holiday season Lakers Ticket Exchange is the official resale Marketplace of your Lakers grab your seat it's 100% verified and secured go to lakers.com exchange to find your seats right now we've got Portland who's been struggling coming in in a couple of nights in Atlanta who has been playing really well and they're in and at the end of the week it's a tail end of that back to back in fact Atlanta has dealt Cleveland two of their four losses he just saw Atlanta down in Georgia that's good play by Jerome Jerome he had Austin Reaves CH running at him so he just let him run by and then shoots it high off the window over Anthony Davis boy Jes a quintessential journeyman you know he just wherever you you give him a job he's going to do a solid job for you oo foul by strs which is not a smart foul for them because Reaves that's three should get three free throws bring it back to 10 how about this right now from mango cooling off this cavaliere team from the perimeter and again they're going up against the number one team as steu mentioned a moment ago and all three knocked down by Reaves Austin checks in with his 25th point or 26 point I'm sorry 26 points at nine out of 10 free throws for Reaves another open three and that's Niang this time another open three I mean I just don't understand how they're getting so seven guys have hit threes 1 two three four five multiple threes tonight for Cleveland Anthony Davis well he was hoping for a three-point Opportunity Knocks it down over Allen the Workman like Cleveland Cavaliers though with seven minutes to play are up by 11 they have been such a composed Team all season long underneath they try to get it to Allen too easy as he slams it home Darius Garland did a good job of getting it to Island now double double for Garland 12 points 10 assists re boy he's got his eye on at least 30 you see him look off Jarrett Allen like he was going to pass to Anthony Davis he's got 28 and 10 Reaves is two rebounds away from another triple double his second in three games Garland trying to put a move on and he loses it Mustard's off the high Lakers battling it's 10594 Lakers trying to win there third in a row Davis offensive foul on Anthony Davis is isn't it hooked his arm he'll catch me hand in the cookie job you see a lot of players do that particular type move I'm trying to figure out why what advantage it gives you Strus that's not a going to be close that was like a I would say a heat check but that's him whether he's hitting him or not he's going to shoot him like that four out of eight that's not Ultra hot it's not bad it's really good actually but oh look at this spin move grees and he'll earned two free throws which means all right now this holiday season the Lakers you could take everywhere you go right now on this New Year's Eve the Lakers are down by nine five and when you're playing the number one team in the league getting multiple stops in succession can prove to be difficult will play Dallas have a four game home stand what a move by Strus well he's proven that he's not just a three-point guy although that's all we had been seeing Reaves at the other end Bo they found him didn't they he put himself in perfect position movement without LeBron with the assist LeBron James with 184 and five again crowd urging defense yeah that would be a good idea Mitchell launches and Lakers here they come looking to make a move LeBron crosscourt finds r R and Cleveland just ball watch that time they had five guys watching the basketball and can the Lakers take advantage no I was saying yes and then I had to take it back by the way we've entered the final five minutes of the game brought to you by Morango casino resort that would have been that would have been a big hoop o huge would have brought it to within six could be a five-point switch is not oh and that hit really gotur who is out of bounds it bounced inbound well they're going to get it in so it's a moot point now Garland the speed Allen the basket boy Garland made that happen didn't he he's made the last few baskets in the paint happen good player remember when he and ston were back court together they figured they were going to trade one and it was Colin who went to Utah and you got Donovan Mitchell here Anthony Davis midrange all right four minutes to play Down nine you've got to get your defense in order yeah you've got to get stops you cannot trade Hoops now count it and the foul Jarrett Allen and again three straight games Allen now in double figures and he has a team leading 20 make it 19 double doubles on the year lob to Davis he got behind the defense Slam at home Anthony Davis because they got confused on how they wanted to play that screen with LeBron they just feel like they can almost give up Hoops cuz they're they're scoring just about every trip down and the Lakers will take it away on the good defensive effort now it's LeBron here he goes all the way to score just bullied his way in he was not going to be denied to shoot six five Lakers in good shape here defending and R steals it but they're going to get lucky LeBron yes wow W huge Cav for that one and then shot it in motion huge three in front of a sellout thr it's down to five only lost four games they haven't lost since they Miami beat him and an and one for Allen after Garland three-point play Here by Jarrett alen he comes up empty it's a seven-point game again their last loss was at Miami on December the eth they've lost to Miami Atlanta twice and Boston that's it and we're here at the New Year Reaves open o big miss that time 114 107 cuz we're coming up on the two-minute Mark next time they shoot it it will be below 2 minutes on the way right around LeBron who was hoping yeah but LeBron was it was too deep LeBron that's her back with a three not this time and Cleveland in great shape in great shape to win again it would be their eighth in a row and their 29th of the year here 116 107 with a minute and a half remaining they would remain unbeaten against the Western Conference Mitchell fires and launches a three oh Jarrett Allen is there and that might be good night he was there for the follow basket that is 22 Second Chance Miami points 27 for Allen and the Lakers get an add one stay right here steu as you ask you shall receive thank you 35 assist 10 nine rebounds unfortunately it's 35 not enough may go for not oh absolutely yeah underneath great pass great pass underneath Garin what a game making things happening Garland's got 13 assists yeah Mak 14 need to Fe the hamst on his St machine yeah he is a little slow slow all night a little bit although a great stat crew here he can't blame them it's the machine now Cleveland's going to win again how about that they're going to sweep the Lakers this year and they got a chance to beat him by double digits in both games a chance Garland for three rebound batted round Cavs have it they can milk the clock and they're going to do just that they're going to be in Dallas again in a couple of nights Garland all the way to score Garland all the way to score well their their back court is as as good as there is his Le yeah as good as Advertiser better they were impressive we've seen them twice we won't see them again and they are playing and brimming with confidence and rightfully so what a good basketball team ERS ran into him tonight winning begins winning yeah it really does just like losing does the opposite so now the Lakers will get New Year's Day on
